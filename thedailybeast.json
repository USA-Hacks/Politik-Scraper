{"entityId": 1476, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It may not be a sexy story, but HUD\u2019s new measures on housing segregation are a potential game-changer.\n\nIt may not have anything to do with Donald Trump or Confederate flags, but the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s announcement to modify rules and release new data covering integration and segregation with regard to fair housing practices is important news, and a necessary and inventive approach for combating systemic racism and inequality.\n\nHUD will provide publicly open data \u201con patterns of integration and segregation, racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty, disproportionate housing needs, and disparities in access to opportunity.\u201d The new data will provide local officials with valuable information to combat segregation in their communities and to create housing policies that will do so.\n\nBut of course not all local officials will just look at these data and decide to fix things, so there\u2019s an enforcement side to this as well: Armed with the new data, HUD will be able to withhold funds from grantees who do not meet these new requirements.\n\nIn response, congressional Republicans have threatened to deny funding for its implementation, and, in the same way many states have chosen not to take the Obamacare Medicaid money, some municipalities have decided to forgo HUD funding because of their refusal to comply with the fair housing mandates. Yet despite the inevitable blowback from communities that are stuck in their ways, and proponents of small government, this decision should be viewed as a landmark step in fighting the evolving face of racial discrimination in America.\n\n\u201cI think the data is going to give us some new indicators. The face of housing discrimination has probably shifted,\u201d said Steve Glaude, the executive director of the Coalition for Nonprofit Housing and Economic Development. \u201cThe data will give us \u2018what\u2019s the new look of discrimination.\u2019 What\u2019s the face? Where are its eyes, and nose, and ears today compared to where those things were in times past?\u201d\n\nThe aim of these recent developments is to break the vicious cycle of creating an America of \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave nots.\u201d\n\nThe housing fight has shifted from the known bigoted intent of housing practices of old, when African Americans were regularly denied loans, directed toward predatory loans, or barred from buying homes in certain areas due to unofficial covenants amongst white home owners, and more. Now, the emphasis focuses more on the impact of the policies, and the awareness of communities about their racial disparities, and not nearly as much on the hate filled intent of others. This showcases progress in the right direction, but also highlights how much progress still needs to be done.\n\nFor example, the neighborhood where I live in Washington, DC at one point had an unofficial covenant among white home owners that they refused to sell to blacks. That is a thing of the past, and at one point my area was predominantly black. Yet presently, my neighborhood is going through a significant wave of gentrification, and many black residents are being forced out of the neighborhood. The first iteration obviously denied housing and opportunity of black Americans due to racial motivations. The current one does not, yet the diminishing opportunities for minorities remain.\n\n\u201cIt is obvious when gentrification comes that the many people coming in do not understand that people are being displaced, and generally what we would expect of people is that they would want these neighborhoods to be diverse,\u201d said Maurice Jackson, Georgetown University professor and chairman of the DC Commission on African American Affairs. \u201cThe response has to be to creating mixed neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nTherefore, combating racial injustice without necessarily a racist intent has become the main aspect of these HUD regulations, and none of this would be possible without the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision on the 1968 Fair Housing Act.\n\nThe focal point of the Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision last month in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project is the codifying of \u201cdisparate impact.\u201d\n\nDisparate impact states that a policy may be considered discriminatory if it has a disproportionate \u201cadverse impact\u201d against any group based on race, national origin, color, religion, sex, family status, or disability. The key distinction here is that the discriminatory practices are not determined by the intent of the violator. The impact and not the intent of the actions is what matters most, and that is what makes the availability of HUD\u2019s data so valuable.\n\nIn the Court\u2019s decision, the Inclusive Communities Project argued that \u201cdisparate impact\u201d was in effect when the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs distributed tax credits for low-income housing because the state\u2019s formula ensured that the housing was primarily built in poor, minority neighborhoods and rarely in more affluent white suburban ones. This resulted in people receiving housing in environments with weak communities, high crime rates, poor access to public transportation, poor schools, and few employment opportunities. The class and racial divisions remained under this formula, and would only become more pronounced if we kept with this policy.\n\nThe remarkable impact of this decision, and HUD\u2019s new policies, is that countless American cities function under similar formulas. Low-income housing developments are rarely found in middle- to upper-class neighborhoods, and most areas can point to a part of their city where the crime rate is high, low-income housing exists, the schools are bad, and the job opportunities are low. These areas are commonly dominated by minority residents.\n\nThe aim of these recent developments is to break the vicious cycle of creating an America of \u201chaves\u201d and \u201chave nots.\u201d Our society has always been structured in a way to ensure that there have been these two groups. To break this cycle, and acknowledge the significance of disparate impact, HUD is releasing troves of data that local officials can use to formulate plans to address segregation and racially concentrated areas of poverty. The new policy is not accusatory, but is enlightening and should build a better awareness for government officials and city residents about how their communities can foster diversity instead of perpetuating enclaves of disparate levels of opportunity.\n\nHUD and the Obama Administration are choosing to fight inequality and opportunity gaps in housing and community building by providing stakeholders with more information, working with communities to create strategies to address areas in need, and holding grantees accountable. Fighting injustice through togetherness is a step in the right direction, now we must commit to working together so that progress can continue to be made.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:46.648+0000"}

Daniel graduated from there in 2007, Larry in 2009, both still in the era of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell,\u201d a 17-year period when some 13,000 people were forced out of the military for being openly gay.\n\nThat only ended after a federal judge declared it illegal in late 2010. Daniel had by then served a tour as a platoon leader in Iraq. He was subsequently deployed twice to Afghanistan, in 2011 and 2012. He was on a brief leave from the war zone when he met Larry in Seattle.\n\n\u201cMet this guy and we decided to spend the next four days together before I went back to Afghanistan,\u201d Daniel later said in a Facebook post.\n\nDaniel returned home safe. And, in November 2013, he and Larry were married in the Cadet Chapel at West Point.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I didn\u2019t get married at West Point to make any kind of statement, we got married there because we love West Point and it\u2019s a place we both think of as home,\u201d Daniel later said.\n\nThe two left active duty, but only because they chose to do so. They lived in Boston while Daniel attended Harvard Business School and then moved to New York.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, the couple took a Sunday stroll to Soho News International, a corner store on Prince Street that stocks a wide range of cultural magazines. They were happy proof of how far we have come just in the past few years.\n\nProof of how far we still have to go entered in the person of a 40-year-old man in a white T-shirt, blue shorts, and a black backpack. He began screaming what Larry would describe as \u201canti-gay obscenities.\u201d He then sucker-punched Danny in the mouth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that in 2015 we would have to deal with anti-gay hate crimes in Soho of all places but that\u2019s what happened,\u201d Larry later posted on Facebook.\n\nLarry put to the most practical use the physical training that is mandatory for all new cadets at West Point.\n\n\u201cHe left covered in his own blood with his tail between his legs after I handled the situation and tossed him in the street like the coward loser he is,\u201d Larry reported.\n\nThe police were called and subsequently posted a surveillance photo taken by a camera installed by the store\u2019s entrance.\n\nHandout\n\n\u201cThe hate crimes division of the NYPD is on the case and we have full faith a positive outcome will follow,\u201d Larry further reported. \u201cWe refuse to be victims and are thankful we can defend ourselves, but are saddened by the fact that idiots like this guy might not pick two guys who went through Plebe Boxing next time.\u201d\n\nNews of the attack no doubt had particular meaning for those who had heard Daniel when he was the guest speaker at the Second Annual Pride Day Observance at Fort Hood back in June.\n\n\u201cCelebrating Victories That Have Affirmed Freedom and Fairness,\u201d read the poster for the event.\n\nAs reported by the Fort Hood Sentinel, Daniel described some of his experiences in the not so long ago days of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI kept everyone at arm\u2019s length so they wouldn\u2019t suspect anything,\u201d he told the gathered soldiers. \u201cLike any good platoon leader, I knew everything about my soldiers and NCOs\u2014from their weapons range scores to their kids\u2019 names to when they had doctor\u2019s appointments\u2014but they didn\u2019t know anything about my private life\u2026at times I felt isolated.\u201d\n\nHe went on: \u201cI worked hard to prove myself, though, so no one would question my right to belong. I took on tough assignments on deployment and worked to prove myself in infantry training and at Ranger school. Still, I worried a lot about secrecy and worked hard to hide my relationships from co-workers.\u201d\n\nHe said that he and Larry had not been seeking to make history when they got married at West Point.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t think anyone would take notice of our small private ceremony,\u201d he said. \u201cMany interpreted our wedding as a symbol that the country and the military had achieved a milestone in gay rights\u2026We received so many letters from soldiers who were still closeted or afraid, or soldiers just thanking us.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of the importance of people in the LGBT community sharing their experiences.\n\n\u201cWe need to know our own history if we hope to progress forward,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone understands the importance of history, it\u2019s soldiers. We know that without understanding our history, we\u2019re more likely to repeat past mistakes. We know that history can not only provide wisdom and guidance, but also inspiration.\u201d\n\nHe spoke of the all-black regiments of \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d and of the trailblazing Women\u2019s Army Air Corps.\n\nThere is no denying that America has never been a better place to be gay or female or black or a person of any persuasion who believes in equality.\n\n\u201cThey stood for a freedom that they did not yet know themselves,\u201d Daniel said. \u201cTheir stories are of citizens so committed to their country that they served despite having an unequal [path].\u201d\n\nThose stories are now joined by the stories of the LGBT soldiers. The end of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d was another step toward true American greatness, just as were the end of official segregation in the military and the significant progress toward equality for women.\n\nThis past March 11, Daniel posted a photo of a white military gravestone bearing the name of a West Point classmate. Captain Sara Knutson Cullen was a 27-year-old helicopter pilot and Bronze Star recipient who was killed on that date in 2013 in Afghanistan.\n\nShe had been a high school junior when she happened to visit West Point on the day before 9/11. She died in a war that had still not ended a dozen years later, that has still not really ended even now.\n\nYet if the country had stumbled into another quagmire and if the economy had faltered and if too many jobs had been outsourced and if gun violence was out of control, there had indeed been victories for fairness and freedom. Cullen\u2019s commander in chief when she died was black. And the comrade who remembered her by posting a picture of her grave is a man who married another man at West Point in a ceremony such as the Supreme Court has since ruled to be protected by the law.\n\nWhen Donald Trump says we need to make America great again, he is saying there was once a time when America was a stronger and better nation.\n\nBut however much work is still to be done, there is no denying that America has never been a better place to be gay or female or black or a person of any persuasion who believes in equality.\n\nTherein is the promise of riches beyond the measure of money. And as we grow stronger in acceptance and tolerance and bonding is proof that the structure to admire most is not a tower that rises above everybody but a bridge that reaches from one to another.\n\nOf course there is still much to be done, and better does not mean good enough. Racism remains a challenge for all decent souls, as does sexism. And Daniel speaks of the gay service members who remain fearful.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we still have soldiers in the Army today too afraid to leave the closet should motivate us to continue down the path toward greater acceptance and change,\u201d he said in his speech.\n\nAnd then there are bigots such as the one who attacked Daniel and Larry in the corner store. The cops are all but sure to make an arrest, but there will still be too many more like him.\n\nWhat Trump and the rest of us should be saying is this:\n\nWe need to make America even greater.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:46.950+0000"}

{"entityId": 1479, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "We thought Trump was just a summer fling for the GOP, but it\u2019s becoming increasingly more likely that some Republicans have met their match.\n\nDonald Trump has been a larger-than-life figure for almost a generation: businessman, entertainer, pageant purveyor, and life philosopher. In politics though, most have seen him as an oddity at best, if not an outright lightweight. His decision to enter the Republican race this year was met with similar disdain. Pundits thought he would be a flash in the pan\u2014a momentary media darling\u2014whose lack of substance and irreverent ways would eventually catch up with him. Many argued that he would follow a similar trajectory to some of the more unlikely 2012 Republican candidates like Herman Cain (remember him?). We thought this as well.\n\nSo began Trump-mentum 2015\u2014and it was the \u201cflash\u201d we\u2019d all been expecting. He rose from 0.4 percent of the vote when Ipsos first started including him in our candidate list in March, to 9.7 percent the week of June 16 when he announced. However, since July 25 he has taken a commanding lead\u2014and kept it. He is outstripping his rival candidates by more than 20 points, and polling comfortably at 30 percent or higher.\n\nPerhaps most impressively, this high rating has held\u2014even increased\u2014despite behavior that normally turns off voters: bombastic statements about his own worth and accomplishments, divisive statements about immigration, and more.\n\nSo is Trump just a summer fling or something more serious? Does he have a real chance to be the Republican nominee?\n\nLet\u2019s examine the evidence by assessing each argument against Trump securing the nomination, and its relative strength.\n\n1. THE \u201cIT\u2019S TOO EARLY\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThese pollsters say: Forget the polls (for now). They are misleading this far out from Election Day, and are dangerous false positives. People are not thinking seriously about the election now, so views are more impressionistic and subject to media buzz than grounded or usefully predictive of an election outcome. We always warn our clients that at this stage it is way too early to discern much from the polls.\n\nSource: Ipsos analysis of American presidential polling data 1980-2012\n\nThis is illustrated well in the table above, which shows the difference between published poll data (using poll aggregator sites) and the final election outcome at various points prior to Election Day: We see that while the average poll variance from the final outcome one week before Election Day was just 1.7 percent, the variance a year out was almost 8 percent.\n\nThis data is a cautionary note that we probably shouldn\u2019t pay too much attention to poll data this far from Election Day. Based on this evidence alone, we would discount Trump\u2019s chances\u2026 but this is not our only evidence of course.\n\nArgument strength: Pretty good\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 10/90\n\n2. THE \u201cBUT HE\u2019S A FAUX PAS MACHINE\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nConventional wisdom tells us that political indiscretions like \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured\u2014I like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d or \u201cThey\u2019re rapists\u201d will sink a campaign. They did with George Allen and \u201cmacaca\u201d in 2006, and with Rick Perry\u2019s 2011 Republican debate \u201coops\u201d moment.\n\nThis is harder to quantify but a very important qualitative factor in assessment. So far he has survived! This by itself is impressive, and even seems to be some of his appeal. Perhaps we have bypassed the era when an embarrassing online video is sufficient fodder to sink a campaign?\n\nWhether this continues remains to be seen; perhaps enough people aren\u2019t yet paying attention.\n\nArgument strength: Decent\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 20/80\n\n3. THE \u201cMORE AIR THAN SUBSTANCE\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThis argument goes: Trump is a media phenom. The \u201cKim Kardashian\u201d of politics: all air and no substance. We\u2019ve heard of him a lot, but we\u2019re not quite sure who he really is, or what he stands for. He is polling well because of name recognition alone, but that will soon fade when people start to consider the man himself. However, the data does not support this at all.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nA good baseline measure for candidate viability is what we call a \u201cfam-fav\u201d analysis: familiarity and favorability measures for each candidate. Typically, candidates early on in their campaigns struggle most with name recognition: those who people recognize do better (than they would or will otherwise) solely because people recognize their names (familiarity) and indicate in polls that they would vote for them. By pairing this with data on how favorably people feel about the candidate, we\u2019re often able to identify early likely winners and \u201cduds.\u201d\n\nFor example, if we look at the 2011/12 Republican primary candidates, Romney had the strongest fam/fav combination\u2014and he ultimately took the candidacy. Comparatively, Herman Cain, while polling as well-known\u2014was indeed a \u201cflash in the pan\u201d given his weak favorability scores.\n\nAs such, we would expect that while Trump\u2019s familiarity levels would be very high, his favorability would be comparatively lower due to his non-political background and blustering persona. However, we can see in the chart above that Trump enjoys very high fam/fav ratings and indeed clusters with \u201cserious\u201d politicians Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton\u2014far outstripping all his Republican opponents on both familiarity and favorability measures.\n\nIt seems there is substance here, perhaps more than we initially thought. Established recognition and favorable perceptions that come from outside politics (especially powerful, perhaps, in this period of strong anti-Washington sentiment) puts him on \u201cfam-fav\u201d par with senior Democrat politicians Clinton and Biden\u2014and means that there is more here than it appears.\n\nArgument strength: Not so good\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 60/40\n\n4. THE \u201cWE\u2019VE SEEN THIS ALL BEFORE\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThe rise and fall of a host of Republican candidates from the 2012 election really says it all. Both Perry and Gingrich got about six weeks in the sun, although none pulled as far ahead nor grew the lead like Trump has over the past weeks. The 2011/12 nomination cycle also had a strong \u201cestablishment\u201d favorite in Mitt Romney, whose early numbers tracked high.\n\nSo, not a direct comparison to 2015/16, but if we learned anything from the last Republican nomination fight, it is that we can cycle through candidates very quickly.\n\nArgument strength: Very good\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 5/95\n\n5. THE \u201cTRUMP\u2019S VOTERS WON\u2019T SHOW UP AT THE POLLS\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThis theory suggests that Trump is attracting the virtually engaged but that they won\u2019t show up on Election Day; that they are \u201cunengaged\u201d and less likely to vote. But evidence shows the contrary.\n\nTypically, voter turnout is explained by a series of concentric circles, such as the image below: increasingly smaller proportions of the population turn out to vote depending on the type of election. Critically, the voter profile also changes as we focus our sights on different voter types, with Republicans more likely to actually turn up on Election Day than Democrats.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nFor primaries in particular, it is generally a far more ideologically active \u201cbase\u201d that casts a vote compared to the larger\u2014and typically broader more centrist\u2014group of Republicans who vote on Election Day, for the presidential candidates.\n\nWhile this would naturally support a \u201cnontypical\u201d and base-friendly candidate like Trump, the argument has also been posited that Trump\u2019s voters themselves are \u201cnontraditional\u201d Republicans and so are less likely to actually vote.\n\nSo, with this knowledge, and our working hypothesis that Trump supporters are unlikely to show up at the polls, we would expect to see his share of the vote shrink when we move from all Republicans, to those who are registered, and will actually vote. This, however, is not at all the case:\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nThere is little difference in support over time among these groups, suggesting that supporter turnout will not hold Trump back from winning the nomination.\n\nArgument strength: Meh\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 70/30\n\n6. THE \u201cBUT TRUMP DOESN\u2019T KNOW WHAT AMERICA WANTS\u201d ARGUMENT\n\nThis is a more qualitative and subjective argument, but fundamentally suggests that Trump just doesn\u2019t understand the country or the Republicans well enough to be a serious contender, much less win the nomination. This argument has been made by fellow candidates Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush, Rick Santorum, as well as conservative columnists like George Will, Erick Erickson, and Matt Lewis.\n\nTo us, this argument couldn\u2019t be more wrong. Indeed, the polling shows the exact opposite. That Trump is actually on to something. That his rants against immigrants and other assorted groups is tapping into a pervasive latent nativism\u2014rather than recent GOP primaries that focused on terrorism, abortion, and family values. And the data on this is absolutely striking.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nIndeed, the Republican base is much more likely to not \u201cidentify with America\u201d and to feel like a \u201cstranger in their own country.\u201d More impressively, 58 percent of Americans independent of political party agree that \u201cmore and more, I don\u2019t identify with what America has become.\u201d This is very fertile ground for a populist of Trump\u2019s ilk.\n\nArgument strength: Terrible\n\nOur odds for Trump getting the nomination based on this argument alone : 99/1\n\nCONCLUSION? DON\u2019T UNDERESTIMATE THE POWER OF THE DONALD\n\nTrump is a genuine contender in this race. More importantly, his nativist messaging resonates with the Republican base. Contrary to the pundits, there is a method to his madness. And, more broadly, there is room for his brand of populism.\n\nOf course, it is still early and most people aren\u2019t paying much attention to the race yet\u2014so if we had to put money on it today, we\u2019d still bet against Trump winning the nomination, but not by much. The biggest X-factor in all this is Trump himself. He might tire of the political thing, turning his energies elsewhere.\n\nSo Trump is not just a summer fling. Should we all be getting the wedding invite? Maybe! We wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it showed up in the mail sometime mid-year 2016.\n\nSource: Ipsos\n\nCliff Young is president of Ipsos Public Affairs US, and an adjunct professor at both Johns Hopkins and Columbia Universities.

He soundly defeated Vicki Slater, a trial lawyer with the backing of a lot of the Democratic establishment, and Dr. Valerie Adream Smartt Short, an obstetrician-gynecologist\u2014without spending a single penny. In a heartbreaking admission, Slater reportedly told the AP \u201cI did everything I could to win this.\u201d The Daily Beast has reached out to her campaign for comment and has yet to hear back.\n\nGray earned 51 percent of the vote Tuesday, obliterating Slater, who nabbed only 30.2 percent. A small group of Mississippi Democrats have begun to galvanize support for the candidate, creating a Facebook page with a mere 170 likes.\n\nThe Democratic establishment is seemingly holding their breath as they trudge toward the November election with a candidate that is the textbook definition of an Average Joe. The chances of Democrats actually winning the election were always vanishingly small, but Gray\u2019s appearance at the top of the ticket will likely complicate efforts to hold on to the offices they do control in the deep-red state.\n\n\u201cI did not know Mr. Gray prior to Tuesday\u2019s election,\u201d Brandon Jones, the executive director of the Mississippi Democratic Trust, said in an interview with The Daily Beast. \u201cThis was a very unique moment where you had the two most prominent and most well financed candidates defeated by a person who didn\u2019t raise money.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could be careening towards a Welcome to Mooseport moment down here.\u201d\n\nThe Trust is the Mississippi-based political action committee that helps fund party efforts on various legislative levels. But Jones, who seemed a bit underwater and overwhelmed, said there isn\u2019t enough money to go around to help gubernatorial candidates.\n\nPhil Bryant, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem to view him as any kind of threat.\n\n\u201cI congratulate Robert Gray on his victory on Tuesday,\u201d the governor said in a statement provided to The Daily Beast. \u201cOver 140,000 voters in the Democrat primary voted for him, placing their confidence in him as their nominee\u2014and he garnered that support without the help of the Democrat establishment in Mississippi.\u201d\n\nBased on early interviews, it seems that Gray will focus his campaign on economic issues, using his experience as a small-business owner to back his rhetoric. And he\u2019s impressed at least one person so far\u2014albeit the guy who\u2019s tasked with keeping what\u2019s left of the state\u2019s Democratic Party alive.\n\n\u201cHe seems to have a very good grasp of what\u2019s going on with the Mississippi economy, unlike our current governor, who has never held a private-sector job,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis guy is a small-business man and he understands some of the strains that are going on across the state.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe could be careening towards a Welcome to Mooseport moment down here,\u201d he said.\n\nGray has yet to return a request for comment from The Daily Beast.

Tim Kaine (D-VA) said Clinton name-checked the Vermont senator early in her remarks, giving him \u201creal praise for carrying the Democratic flag high with a lot of excited supporters, some comment like that that was real positive right at the start of her comments.\u201d\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said Sanders appeared to appreciate the acknowledgement.\n\n\u201cI think he smiled, that\u2019s the best way of putting it,\u201d Blumenthal said.\n\nThe lovefest was sort of mutual.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like negative campaigns, I\u2019ve never run a negative ad in my life,\u201d Bernie Sanders said. \u201cI believe the American people are entitled to serious discussion about serious issues.\u201d\n\nSanders left the lunch to hold a media availability with reporters\u2014something Clinton did not do during her Hill jaunt\u2014and promised to run a civil campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like negative campaigns, I\u2019ve never run a negative ad in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe the American people are entitled to serious discussion about serious issues.\u201d\n\nThat said, Sanders was clear that while the two could be cordial, they also disagree on a lot of key issues for progressives.\n\nHe listed trade agreements, the Keystone XL pipeline, the war in Iraq, the Patriot Act, and climate change as places Clinton could use some improvement.\n\nHe then dinged Clinton for something reporters complain about all the time: her lack of clarity.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe we should be excavating or transporting some of the dirtiest fuel on this planet,\u201d he said, referring to his opposition to the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. \u201cI think Sec. Clinton has not been clear on her views on that issue.\u201d\n\nAnd then there is her coziness with Wall Street.\n\n\u201cI believe that we should break up the major financial institutions and certainly go forward with restoring Glass-Steagall financial regulations,\u201d he continued. \u201cTo the best of my knowledge, those are ideas that Sec. Clinton does not agree with.\u201d\n\nAnd he needled the former secretary of state for neglecting to clarify her stance on infrastructure construction, his proposed transaction tax on Wall Street speculation, and a hike of the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nStill, the interactions between Sanders and Clinton in the Capitol on Tuesday indicate the pair may not campaign in the knock-down, drag-out slugfest style that dominated the 2008 Democratic primaries.\n\n\u201cWe were all grown-ups, we all like each other, we\u2019re all in the same party,\u201d said Sen.

It wasn\u2019t what got me to leave my [ophthalmology] practice.\u201d\n\nLater, Paul was asked \u201cwhether he believes the issue of abortion is more best handled by the states, or by the federal government under the 14th Amendment,\u201d according to The Daily Caller.\n\n\u201cI think best by the states,\u201d Paul said.\n\nThen, he added, \u201cI think the question that still divides us, and it\u2019s a difficult question, is when does life begin. I think we go down all kinds of rabbit holes talking about other stuff, but I\u2019m an ophthalmologist, and I see 1-, 2-pound babies in the neonatal nursery. I look into their eyes to try to prevent a form of blindness that is now preventable\u2026and everybody agrees that that a 1-pound baby has rights. If someone were to hurt that 1-pound baby in the neonatal nursery, it\u2019s a problem. That baby has rights. But we somewhat inconsistently say that a 7-pound baby at birth or just before birth has no rights. And so I think these are questions we have to sort out. We just have to figure when we agree life begins.\u201d\n\nPaul tried to figure that out himself, in 2013.\n\nThat year, he introduced a bill, S.583, into the Senate. Titled the \u201cLife at Conception Act,\u201d the legislation, sometimes called \u201cfetal personhood,\u201d would define a person as a fertilized egg and, according to a press release from Paul\u2019s office, \u201cwould implement equal protection under the 14th Amendment for the right to life of each born and unborn human.\u201d\n\nPaul was adamant that the proposal would not \u201camend or interpret the Constitution\u201d but would instead rely \u201con the 14th Amendment, which specifically authorizes Congress to enforce its provisions.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Congress had taken care of ensuring that the government couldn\u2019t take away life, liberty, or property from any person without due process of law in 1868\u2014but Congress hadn\u2019t been specific enough. What constitutes a person?\n\nBy defining life as beginning with the fertilization of an egg, Paul\u2019s bill would cleverly nullify Roe v. Wade, circumventing the Supreme Court, to leave the issue of abortion in state hands.\n\nBut since the introduction of the \u201cLife at Conception Act,\u201d Paul has made statements that have made it difficult to understand what, exactly, he believes.\n\nShortly after the bill\u2019s unveiling, CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer asked Paul if there would be exceptions for rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk. Paul replied, \u201cWhat I would say is that there are thousands of exceptions. I\u2019m a physician, and every individual case is going to be different\u2026Everything is going to be particular to that individual case and what is going on [with] that mother and the medical circumstances of that mother\u2026I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as simple as checking a box saying, \u2018Exceptions\u2019 or \u2018No exceptions.\u2019\u201d\n\nLawmakers named Rand Paul don\u2019t get to craft individual abortion laws in all 50 states after Roe v. Wade has been undone by Rand Paul\u2019s \u201cLife at Conception Act.\u201d\n\nThe following year, in October 2014, Paul was asked while campaigning in South Carolina whether Plan B should be legal. \u201cI am not opposed to birth control,\u201d he said. \u201cPlan B is taking two birth control pills in the morning and two in the evening, and I am not opposed to that.\u201d\n\nThat position is defensible since the science is on Paul\u2019s side.\n\nWere Paul\u2019s \u201cLife at Conception Act\u201d to become law, it wouldn\u2019t matter that he believes there should be exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at risk, and it wouldn\u2019t matter that he doesn\u2019t believe Plan B is a form of abortion.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that the science sides with Paul, it doesn\u2019t matter who science sides with. Science doesn\u2019t make laws, lawmakers do. And lawmakers named Rand Paul don\u2019t get to craft individual abortion laws in all 50 states after Roe v. Wade has been undone by Rand Paul\u2019s \u201cLife at Conception Act.\u201d There is no telling what states would do, given the power to decide whether abortion is legal. And it is entirely possible that socially conservative Republicans who believe certain forms of birth control cause abortion could outlaw those forms of birth control, and Paul couldn\u2019t say a thing about it.\n\nNot that you\u2019d be able to understand what he was trying to say anyway.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:48.704+0000"}
{"entityId": 1483, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The blowhard GOP front-runner is right that Black America is struggling. What he doesn\u2019t get is the reason why.\n\nI\u2019m preparing to type four words I never thought I would: \u201cDonald Trump is right.\u201d\n\nOr, to put it differently, he is right that Black America has fared poorly during the era of the first black president. He is also right that many of us had high hopes at the beginning of the Obama era that have not been met.\n\nWhat Trump is dead wrong about, however, is who is to blame.\n\nDuring a phone interview on This Week, Trump said President Obama \u201chas done nothing for African Americans. You look at what\u2019s gone on with their income levels. You look at what\u2019s gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he\u2019d do a fabulous job for the African-American citizens of this country. He has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever.\u201d\n\nTrump is correct: African Americans are struggling more than other groups. According to Pew, \u201cThe wealth of white households was 13 times the median wealth of black households in 2013, compared with eight times the wealth in 2010.\u201d New data released by Pew has also found black children have fallen further behind their peers. While the overall rate of children living in poverty has been decreasing, the number of black children living in poverty continues to rise. Today, 38 percent of black children now live in poverty.\n\nThen there are the unemployment numbers.\n\nIt is no secret that black unemployment has been one of the greatest challenges of the Obama administration. Even as the rest of the economy began to rebound, black unemployment remained staggeringly high before finally beginning to turn a corner in 2014. Yet it has remained noticeably higher than that of whites. So has Obama failed Black America? And if he hasn\u2019t, who is to blame for Black America\u2019s troubles?\n\nLet\u2019s start with unemployment. According to an analysis of decades of labor statistics, black unemployment has been roughly double that of whites since records on the topic started being kept in the 1950s\u2014before President Obama was even born.\n\nAccording to Pew, \u201cThe widest gaps, when black unemployment was as much as 2.77 times that of white unemployment, came in the late 1980s, as the manufacturing sectors that employed disproportionate shares of African-Americans shriveled.\u201d This would be during the era of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Pew continues that \u201cThe smallest gaps, ironically, came in the summer of 2009 during the Great Recession; white unemployment rose so high, so fast, that the black jobless rate was \u2018only\u2019 1.67 times higher.\u201d\n\nSo we know that the first black president is not responsible for creating the black unemployment crisis. The next question becomes could he have done more to solve it. The short answer is yes. The longer answer is only if he had the necessary support to do so, and he hasn\u2019t.\n\nThough few Republican candidates, including Trump, have been honest enough to admit it, race continues to play a major role in hiring decisions\u2014even among hiring managers who are not consciously racist. A few examples among many: Job applicants with black sounding names are significantly less likely to get contacted for interviews: (For those who suggest candidates simply change their first names, there are last names perceived as \u201cblack-sounding\u201d as well.)\n\nBecause of critics on the left, many of them black, the President has not had the necessary support and political leverage to be as candid as he needs to be to address some of our community\u2019s greatest problems.\n\nAn infamous Princeton study also found that a black man without a prison record has as much likelihood getting called back for a second job interview as a white applicant with a prison record. Even when white and black candidates have comparable r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and qualifications, whites were twice as likely to receive an interview callback.\n\nBut of course one of the challenges of being the first black president is that every move the President has made has been viewed and critiqued through the prism of race. As a black man, the President has spent his two terms walking on political eggshells to prove he is not racially biased.\n\nThis political straitjacket has had tragic results for the black community. Senator Mark Pryor told me that a diversity policy resembling football\u2019s \u201cRooney Rule\u201d could improve the playing field for black applicants. But he also acknowledged the challenge of implementing such a policy while the current president is in office.\n\nAnd when it comes to black child poverty, there is plenty of blame to go around. If black adults have a harder time securing employment due to discrimination, that obviously hurts black children. So does the number of black men who are disproportionately incarcerated. President Obama has faced criticism from some black Americans for critiquing black fathers for not being involved enough, instead of critiquing the system that leaves many of them jobless, or in jail.\n\nThis perfectly illustrates why the first black president has been caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to helping the black community address its woes. Because of critics on the left, many of them black, the President has not had the necessary support and political leverage to be as candid as he needs to be to address some of our community\u2019s greatest problems.\n\nFor instance, despite the fact that African Americans are more likely to be unemployed, and have less wealth than whites, we still have higher fertility rates. As long as those numbers hold, we are destined to remain a community shrouded in poverty.\n\nThis means that by the time the President gives a lecture to young fathers on being responsible, it\u2019s usually too late. If a father is unemployed or under-employed and the mother of his child or children is unemployed or under-employed, the fact is their child is going to struggle to have a shot at the American Dream. According to studies, America is one of the least upwardly mobile Western countries in the world, meaning a black child born into poverty will probably live and die in poverty.\n\nI think that\u2019s a travesty. But I also think it\u2019s a travesty that high-profile black Americans, including the President and his black liberal supporters (and critics), are not using their platforms to tell more black Americans the hard truth: It is irresponsible to have children when you know you do not have the financial or emotional bandwidth to raise them.\n\nThe black community will never have a real chance at economic equality until more of us are honest about this. That doesn\u2019t mean letting government off the hook where it deserves accountability. After all, many of the GOP hopefuls are jockeying to defund Planned Parenthood, which is one of the primary sources poor women rely on for contraception. (Go figure.) But it does mean embracing the power we actually have to change our plight, and responsible family planning is something we can control whether racism exists or not.\n\nSo in the end The Donald is right. Black America isn\u2019t doing so great. But if anyone\u2019s to blame, it\u2019s not so much the president, but critics like Trump, who use race as a weapon to critique the first black president without offering any meaningful solutions for improving the plight of Black America.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:48.984+0000"}

According to organizers, more than 150,000 people have RSVP\u2019d for house parties Wednesday evening to listen to a simulcast from the Democratic presidential candidate and coordinate their volunteer efforts. And what Sanders lacks in funds\u2014he raised about $15.2 million this quarter, while Hillary Clinton raked in more than three times that figure\u2014he may make up in true believers with experience in grassroots organizing. This is not a fluke; some of the most dogged pro-Bernie volunteers are alums of the Occupy movement, where they honed their activism skills.\n\n\u201cThe graduates of Occupy are now skilled organizers,\u201d said Katherine Brezler, a Yonkers schoolteacher and national digital organizer at People for Bernie.\n\nShe said some of the core organizers at People For Bernie\u2014a grassroots group unaffiliated with Sanders\u2019s campaign that works to mobilize Sanders volunteers\u2014first met in Zuccotti Park during the 2011 Occupy Wall Street protests.\n\n\u201cAfter Occupy, people didn\u2019t just go and sit in a hole,\u201d Brezler said. \u201cAfter Occupy, people became very involved in their communities and broadened their skill sets, broadened their networks, and now are revisiting a new campaign with revived interest in electoral politics because the candidate is speaking the language of their issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary supporters will be Bernie supporters after the primary.\u201d\n\nThere are numerous constituency groups in the People For Bernie family, said organizer Stan Williams. They range from those representing essential constituencies\u2014including Women for Bernie, African Americans for Bernie, and Labor for Bernie\u2014to slightly more niche groups (the Deadheads for Bernie Facebook page had 1,308 likes at press time). And they relish their independence from the official campaign.\n\n\u201cYou could write terrible things about me and no one\u2019s going to care because I\u2019m not Bernie,\u201d said Charles Lenchner, one of the co-founders of People For Bernie. \u201cWe\u2019re free. We use that freedom to do what we can.\u201d\n\nThat includes curating social media content, training constituency groups, helping smaller organizations write press releases, and generally cheerleading pro-Bernie efforts around the country. They also reach out to some constituencies where Sanders has struggled\u2014especially African-American voters. Nadya Stevens, who works with African Americans for Bernie, said her group is angling to increase Sanders\u2019s name ID among black voters while reminding them of the damage that Bill Clinton\u2019s tough-on-crime policies incurred.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton administration\u2014and that includes Hillary\u2014did some terrible things that adversely impacted the black community,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that she thinks Bill Clinton recently apologized to the NAACP for that legislation because it was the politically expedient thing to do.\n\n\u201cI think that he\u2019s doing that for Hillary because Hillary\u2019s not going to do it herself,\u201d she said.\n\nAs for organizers\u2019 levels of confidence in the likelihood of a Sanders presidency? They vary.\n\n\u201cI have so little faith in the system to begin with,\u201d Lenchner said. \u201cI would just say that an election is an opportunity to organize, and the organizing that we\u2019re doing is likely to have an impact for years to come.\u201d\n\nBrezler, the Yonkers schoolteacher who said she spends 19 hours a day working on the pro-Bernie efforts because school is out, is more bullish.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really excited about this possibility and I believe that we will win,\u201d she said.\n\nShe added that volunteers are in for the long haul.\n\n\u201cWe also know that it\u2019s important to practice self-care and to encourage your teammates to go for a walk, and to check in and have a normal non-Bernie conversation from time to time with people,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, Hillary supporters will be Bernie supporters after the primary,\u201d she added.\n\nBut not all Sanders backers would jump to Team Clinton. Manker, an independent who voted for both Bush and Obama twice, said he would consider voting Republican again if Democrats nominate Clinton.\n\n\u201cI have yet to meet or speak with a single veteran or military person who supports Hillary Clinton for president,\u201d he said, adding that Clinton\u2019s false claims that she ran through sniper fire in Bosnia still anger veterans.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not a minor deal,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat has not gone away.

Allegedly whistling at a white woman.\n\nThis weekend marks the 60th anniversary of the tragic murder of Emmett Till. There will be commemorative events honoring the life of the young teen in Chicago and Mississippi. And that\u2019s because, according to Chris Benson, associate professor of African American studies and journalism at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Till\u2019s death still resonates today.\n\n\u201cThe reason we are so captivated by the lynching of Emmett Till 60 years later is that it\u2019s justice that has not been reached. It grates against our sense of justice in America that this horrible event has never been resolved,\u201d says Benson, who co-authored the book, Death of Innocence with Till\u2019s mother, Mamie Till Mobley. \u201cWe see so many similar cases coming up in the contemporary moment that remind us of the injustice in the Emmett Till case. When we see the case of Trayvon Martin or Michael Brown or Tamir Rice, where young Black males are shot down by authority figures and nobody\u2019s punished, it reminds us of the most celebrated case where a Black teen was killed and nobody was brought to justice.\u201d\n\nAP\n\nHistory notes that Till was with a group of teenagers who had stopped at a local grocery store to buy snacks when he broke Mississippi\u2019s racial code of conduct. Just a year earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court had announced separate but equal schools were unconstitutional in the historic Brown v. Board of education case. But things were still done a little differently in Mississippi. The state fought against any interruption in its system of segregation and often resorted to violence.\n\nSo it was in this space that four days after his alleged \u201ccrime,\u201d Till was kidnapped in the wee hours of the morning on August 28, 1955 by two white men, Roy Bryant, husband of Carolyn Bryant, the store clerk Till allegedly whistled at, and J.W. Milam.\n\nBryant and Milan tortured Till for hours. He was brutally beaten. Barbed wire tied around his neck. He was shot in the head. The young teen was weighted with a cotton gin fan and thrown in the Tallatchie River. Three days later, Till\u2019s bloated body surfaced, his face severely disfigured. He was identified by a ring on his finger, one his mother had given him that had his father\u2019s initials.\n\nWhen Till\u2019s body arrived in Chicago, Mamie Till Mobley couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. She wanted to show the world what Mississippi had done to her son, her only child. Mobley demanded an open-casket at Till\u2019s funeral. His mutilated body was on display for five days as more than 100,000 folks lined the streets of Chicago to get a glimpse of what hate could do. The graphic images were published in Jet magazine and Black newspapers. Her decision changed the course of history.\n\n\u201cOpening that casket and allowing Emmett Till\u2019s body to lay in state allowed people to witness the horrible face of race hatred,\u201d said Benson. \u201cIt horrified people to the extent that they had never seen anything like this and to imagine that our children could be subjected to such horrors really moved people. So opening the casket opened our eyes to the injustice in this country and the consequences of that continued injustice if we didn\u2019t do something about it.\u201d\n\nBut justice would never come.\n\nIt took just little more than an hour for an all-white male jury to acquit Bryant and Milam of the murder of Emmett Till. Months later, Look magazine paid Bryant and Milam $4,000 so they would reveal how they killed the Chicago teen.\n\nThe fact that two white men were not convicted of murdering a young Black boy was not surprising in 1955 Mississippi. But what was surprising was the bravery and courage of Till\u2019s uncle Mose Wright, who stood up during the trial and pointed to Bryant and Milam as the men who had kidnapped Till. It was nearly unheard of for a Black man to oppose a white man in court. In doing so, Wright put his own life in danger and immediately left Mississippi soon after.\n\n\u201cUnderstanding the context in the South at that time, for him to do that was nothing short of courageous,\u201d says Paula Johnson, law professor and co-director of the Cold Case Justice Initiative at Syracuse University. The initiative investigates racially-motivated murders that occurred during the civil rights era.\n\n\u201cAs we talk about Black Lives Matter, this is what Mamie Till Mobley was saying to us\u2014\u2018My son\u2019s life matters.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwo months after Milam and Bryant were acquitted for the murder of Emmett Till, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat on a bus, sparking the 381-day Montgomery bus boycott and the beginning of a Civil Rights Movement led by a young minister by the name of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The fight for civil rights, which had mostly been a legal strategy up until that time, had become a mass movement. Soon after there were Freedom Rides, sit-ins at lunch counters, boycotts, demonstrations, and marches. And all of this can be traced back to Emmett Till.\n\n\u201cAs we talk about Black Lives Matter, this is what Mamie Till Mobley was saying to us\u2014\u2018My son\u2019s life matters,\u2019\u201d says Johnson. \u201cTill was not the first lynching but it was a defining moment in so many ways. Emmett Till\u2019s murder galvanized an activist movement of that which continues today.\u201d\n\nIndeed, during the Movement for Black Lives conference in Cleveland this summer, activists of the Black Lives Matter movement honored the families of civil rights martyrs. The first image was of Emmett Till.\n\nAirickca Gordon-Taylor, cousin of Emmett Till and president of the Mamie Till Mobley Memorial Foundation, spoke at the Movement for Black Lives conference. She says Till kicked off the Black Lives Matter movement and noted that he was \u201ca sacrificial lamb.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many parallels today to what happened in 1955 and if we\u2019re not careful all of our rights will be stripped away again,\u201d Gordon-Taylor told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have to be very diligent and very mindful and we have to come together as a community to work towards putting people in positions and roles that have our best interests at heart to work toward changing these policies.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department re-opened Till\u2019s case in 2004. His body was exhumed and an autopsy was conducted but it was closed three years later due to the statute of limitations and insufficient evidence. But though no one was ever convicted for the murder of Emmett Till, his name will be forever associated with the fight for justice and civil rights. His life will not be forgotten. In fact, there are several movies being made about Emmett Till. A film based on Benson\u2019s book will begin production next year, and it was recently announced that Jay-Z and Will Smith will produce a movie about Till for HBO.\n\n\u201cIn so many ways, the case of Emmett Till was the first Black Lives Matter case,\u201d says Benson. \u201cEmmett Till is certainly a story about racial injustice. It\u2019s a story about white supremacy. But within those elements is a recognition that this is really a story about power. Emmett Till was killed as an expression of power\u2014power over the black body.

The fact is that whether it\u2019s Jeb, or Hillary, or any of \u2019em\u2014they\u2019re all controlled by these people!

The address the PAC provided for supporters to mail their checks to was a Midtown UPS store. Calls to the group\u2019s listed phone number went unanswered, as did an email. The treasurer who submitted the form to the FEC signed it \u201cLes Caldwell,\u201d short for Leslie, and Leslie refused to comment on the record to Politico, while just about every Leslie Caldwell listed in New York chose not to answer or return any of my calls.\n\nCuriously, a closer look at the group\u2019s filing reveals a return address not in New York City but in Colorado.\n\nThat address belongs to Jon Anderson, a lobbyist whose \u201cpractice is focused on corporate compliance and representing clients before federal, state and local government,\u201d according to the website of his firm, Holland & Hart.\n\nA consultant for the PAC, Mike Ciletti, also from Colorado, is also a lobbyist. He has his own group, New West Public Affairs, which he co-founded in 2009, according to his LinkedIn profile. His clients include the Community Financial Services Association, the trade association for payday lenders, which are often accused of predatory lending.\n\nAnderson didn\u2019t return a call, and Ciletti responded to interview requests with frustration that his activity with the PAC had placed him in the spotlight. \u201cPersonally I am waiting to see what other email addresses, phone numbers you can find to try to reach me at. Hats off to you,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cI am not interested in going on the record at this point, perhaps in the future. The focus should be on the candidates.\u201d\n\nAt first glance, Make America Great Again PAC seems like it could be a so-called scam PAC, or a fake political operation intended to do nothing more than help its founders get rich. Scam PACs have been cropping up since the rise of the Tea Party. A Politico investigation in January found that of the $43 million that 33 PACs together raised in the 2014 election cycle, only $3 million was spent on candidates. The rest, well\u2026\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not using the lobbyists. I\u2019m not using donors. I don\u2019t care. I\u2019m really rich.\u201d\n\nBut Trump seemed to quash those concerns when in mid-July he attended a 200-person fundraiser organized by Make America Great Again PAC at a private home in Manhattan. \u201cIt was a combination of friends that have known Mr. Trump for years while others were meeting with him for the first time,\u201d press-shy Ciletti told the press.\n\nMake America Great Again PAC is one of four PACs supporting Trump\u2019s candidacy, though it is the only one to receive his endorsement in the form of a fundraiser appearance.\n\nIt might even be said that, when you really assess the pillars of Trump\u2019s campaign platform, he might be known as the Buddy Roemer of 2016\u2014if Trump weren\u2019t so bombastic and intent on incessant racial insensitivity.\n\nTo the extent that he is selling a political philosophy, it\u2019s this: \u201cI\u2019m really rich.\u201d He\u2019s not just bragging when he says that. What he means is that the system is so broken that anyone who is not really rich is at the mercy of their financial backers. \u201cI\u2019m really rich\u201d is Trump\u2019s way of saying he is, by virtue of his terrific wealth, incorruptible.\n\nTrump is a cynic. In his view, the only way to fix the broken process by which candidates are elected using massive sums of money funneled to them by shadow organizations and power-hungry billionaires looking to get favors in return is to evade the process altogether by supporting someone like him\u2014someone with the capacity to be their own biggest donor, and thus to answer to no one but themselves.\n\nIn his June 16 announcement speech, Trump mentioned lobbyists six times.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve watched politicians,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will never make America great again.

{"entityId": 1488, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "On the two most contentious issues to be decided this month by the Supreme Court, Americans overwhelmingly favor the liberal position. But will they punish Republicans for disagreeing?\n\nThe House of Representatives may look like a Tea Party Patriots rally, but according to a new poll, there\u2019s a liberal supermajority in America. In fact, support for Obamacare and same-sex marriage are now at record highs.\n\nToday, CNN/ORC International released a new poll conducted May 29-31 on the key issues on which the Supreme Court will rule this month, including marriage, Obamacare, voting rights, and free speech. The results are surprising.\n\nRegarding the Affordable Care Act, 43% of respondents said they \u201cgenerally favor\u201d the legislation. That, itself, is the highest favorable rating since the poll began asking the question in March 2010, when the ACA was passed.\n\nBut of the 55% who said they oppose the ACA (interestingly, only 2% had no opinion), 15% oppose the law because it is \u201cnot liberal enough.\u201d These 15% are the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren voters who inhabit my favorite coffee shops in Brooklyn. They\u2019re the ones who pushed for a single payer system, or who view the ACA as a giveaway to insurance companies (which, given that it was a Republican idea, it sort of is).\n\nAdd the favorables and the not-liberal-enoughs together, and you\u2019ve got 58% who favor Obamacare, or something (even?) more liberal. That, too, is a record.\n\nDoubtless, the record high numbers for Obamacare reflect that the law appears to be working. That also accounts for the GOP\u2019s relative silence on the issue, despite its being formally on the agenda of every Republican presidential candidate, and still the subject of obsession at conservative think tanks.\n\nIncidentally, support for the ACA varied widely on racial lines, with 49% of white respondents saying the law was good or not liberal enough, compared with 74% of non-white respondents.\n\nOther than Obamacare, the highest-profile issue remaining on the court\u2019s docket is that of same-sex marriage. Here, 63% of respondents said that \u201cgays and lesbians\u2026 have a constitutional right to get married and have their marriage recognized by law.\u201d\n\nThat number is essentially flat from the last time the question was asked, in February. It reflects a 14 percentage-point jump from five years ago. And while far more Democrats than Republicans support same-sex marriage, both numbers have increased: 35% for Republicans (up from 27% in 2010) and 74% of Democrats (up from 56% in 2010).\n\nHere, however, Republican presidential hopefuls are tripping over themselves to buck the national trend. Most recently, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker said Sunday that he favors a constitutional amendment allowing states to ban gay marriage.\n\nNo one except Lincoln Chafee and George Pataki thinks you can win the Republican presidential nomination by running to the center, and no one except their wives thinks they have a chance of winning it.\n\nWhy the disconnect? Primary politics, of course. No one except Lincoln Chafee and George Pataki thinks you can win the Republican presidential nomination by running to the center, and no one except their wives thinks they have a chance of winning it. To turn out the base, you\u2019ve got to be against the gays.\n\nThe question is whether these disconnects between public opinion and GOP dogma will matter.\n\nLiberals hope, of course, that these positions come back to haunt the GOP come fall 2016. But there is good reason to be skeptical. Not only have presidential candidates always flip-flopped between April and October, it\u2019s hard to envision many swing voters making a candidate\u2019s stance on marriage or Obamacare the one issue that tips the balance toward Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe new numbers help fill out the picture. On Obamacare, 29% of Republicans and 55% of Independents said that they favor the law, or that it\u2019s not liberal enough. (Note to the 17% of Republicans who said it\u2019s not liberal enough: You are confused.) But do any of them feel so strongly about the issue that it will meaningfully affect their vote? We don\u2019t know.\n\nMarriage might be different: 35% of Republicans and 69% of Independents say gays have a right to marry. The contrary numbers are somewhat higher than those on Obamacare, but more importantly, marriage could become a defining issue in the way that Obamacare is not. It\u2019s a cultural barometer, and a fast-moving target. Hardcore opposition may make a Candidate Walker or Bush seem prejudiced, or out of touch, or too socially conservative.\n\nThat\u2019s especially true given the wingnuts who will likely take to the streets after a Supreme Court ruling. Every time someone makes a reasonable case for traditional marriage, some moron makes a Neanderthal one\u2014like the Westboro Baptist Church taking on Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling this past week.\n\nOf course, there are wingnuts against Obamacare too. But opposition to Obamacare isn\u2019t really a moral issue except for those already on the fringes, and it\u2019s easy to distinguish a principled disagreement about the size of government from a ludicrous Tea Party conspiracy theory.\n\nBut on marriage, the gap between the Republican base and the American voter is growing, and the Christian Right is starting to look mean.\n\nFinally, one might wonder: If there\u2019s a near two-thirds liberal supermajority on these key political bellwethers, why is the House so firmly in the hands of the one-third minority?\n\nUnfortunately, the answer to that question lies far from high-wattage Supreme Court cases, and in the haze of voter suppression, gerrymandering, and the enormously successful REDMAP project to create Republican congressional districts any which way but loose. These are the factors that have created a Congress that looks and votes so unlike America, but they\u2019re also issues that make most voters\u2019 eyes glaze over.\n\nMaybe one day, the disconnect will cause some of them to open.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:51.515+0000"}

Should she become president, would these foreign friends that have enriched the Clinton Foundation and the Clintons themselves through exorbitant speaking fees receive preferential treatment?\n\nAuthor Peter Schweitzer may be a conservative, but that doesn\u2019t mean his investigations don\u2019t have merit, and his allegations won\u2019t stick.\n\n\u201cIf I were a foreign government, I know which horse I would back,\u201d says Craig Holman, public affairs lobbyist for Public Citizen. Holman was on Capitol Hill in 2011 promoting legislation to ban insider trading by members of Congress when he got a call from 60 Minutes producer Ira Rosen looking for a story. The Stock Act (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) only had nine sponsors, but Rosen picked up on it and, as Holman related the story to The Daily Beast, 60 Minutes partnered with Schweizer. Six months later the show aired a blockbuster story accusing Democrat Nancy Pelosi and Republicans John Boehner and Spencer Baucus, who chaired the House Financial Services Committee, of profiting from financial trades based on insider information they had access to as members of Congress.\n\nOvernight, the Stock Act had 270 sponsors after languishing for years in multiple Congresses after Democrat Louise Slaughter first introduced it in 2006. \u201cIt was like paper clips to a magnet,\u201d recalls Stephen Spaulding of Common Cause. Five months after the 60 Minutes report, President Obama signed the Stock Act into law, praising the legislation as \u201ca good and necessary thing,\u201d and saying, \u201cWe were sent here to serve the American people and look out for their interests\u2014not to look out for our own interests.\u201d\n\nSchweizer\u2019s book, Throw Them All Out, was the centerpiece of the 60 Minutes expos\u00e9. He was quoted at the time saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money, it\u2019s about a sense of entitlement,\u201d politicians feeling the rules don\u2019t apply to them\u2014the same arguments he\u2019s making in his examination of the Clintons and their intertwined financial interests.\n\nThe politicians singled out by Schweizer pushed back hard and there were lots of disputes about whether he had his facts right. Drew Hammill, Pelosi\u2019s spokesman, countered every allegation and called it \u201ctroubling that 60 Minutes would base their reporting off of an already-discredited conservative author who has made a career out of attacking Democrats.\u201d\n\nEven so, the good-government community was cheering. A bill that would otherwise never have passed breezed through both houses of Congress. With inside information the coin of the realm on Capitol Hill, the Stock Act made it clear that staffers and members could not use this knowledge to trade and enrich themselves. Schweizer found enough individual examples that the bill took off \u201cand that\u2019s a feather in his cap,\u201d says Spaulding.\n\nDespite his conservative bona fides\u2014he was a speechwriter in George W. Bush\u2019s administration, and helped tutor Sarah Palin on foreign policy when she ran for vice president\u2014Schweizer is an equal-opportunity investigator, snaring Republicans as well as Democrats. He\u2019s reportedly planning a sequel to Clinton Cash with a similar expos\u00e9 of Bush cash that will focus on the business deals that Jeb Bush busied himself with since leaving the Florida governor\u2019s office almost a decade ago. \u201cHis research is very credible,\u201d says Holman with Public Citizen. \u201cIt can\u2019t be ignored because of partisanship.\u201d\n\nWhen Clinton testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in her confirmation hearing to become secretary of state, lawmakers flagged her husband\u2019s foundation and its prodigious fundraising as a potential conflict of interest. This is a new kind of conundrum, a former president whose spouse and foundation raise all kinds of money on the way to the White House.\n\n\u201cClinton needs to be clear and careful,\u201d says Spaulding. While no one is alleging illegality, there are legitimate questions about appearances that if Clinton does not adequately address will have the effect of further weakening citizens\u2019 faith in their government, and in her capacity as a leader. In every crisis, there is opportunity.

The group couldn\u2019t be more pleased.\n\nPlanned Parenthood gained an unlikely new booster on Tuesday morning: Republican front-runner Donald Trump.\n\nThe billionaire told Chris Cuomo on CNN\u2019s New Day that he opposes federal funding going to Planned Parenthood to pay for abortions, but that he\u2019s OK with tax dollars going to the group to pay for other services that it provides.\n\n\u201cThe problem that I have with Planned Parenthood is the abortion situation. It is like an abortion factory, frankly,\u201d Trump began. \u201cAnd you can\u2019t have it. And you just shouldn\u2019t be funding it. That should not be funded by the government, and I feel strongly about that.\u201d\n\nThen Cuomo asked Trump if he could support funding for other Planned Parenthood efforts, such as providing contraception to women.\n\n\u201cWhat I would do when the time came, I\u2019d look at the individual things they do, and maybe some of the individual things they do are good,\u201d Trump continued, with characteristic eloquence. \u201cI know a lot of the things are bad. But certainly the abortion aspect of it should not be funded by government, absolutely.\u201d\n\nAnd he went on: \u201cI would look at the good aspects of [Planned Parenthood], and I would also look, because I\u2019m sure they do some things properly and good and that are good for women, and I would look at that, and I would look at other aspects also. But we have to take care of women.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s the thing: As NPR detailed last week, federal law prevents the use of taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions in virtually all cases.\n\nPlanned Parenthood gets federal money through the Title X family planning program\u2014none of those funds can be used to pay for abortions\u2014and through Medicaid, which can cover the cost of abortions only \u201cin very restricted cases.\u201d\n\nSo, in short, Trump defended the status quo: half a billion dollars of taxpayer cash for the group.\n\nPlanned Parenthood applauded Trump\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump seems to have realized that banning all abortions, shutting down the government, and defunding Planned Parenthood are extreme positions that are way too far outside the mainstream for even him to take,\u201d said spokesman Eric Ferrero in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe hope that the rest of the GOP field will wake up and reconsider their extreme and unpopular positions on defunding preventive care, abortion bans, and the other economic issues that women and their families care about,\u201d Ferrero continued.\n\nIn other words, Trump is Planned Parenthood\u2019s favorite Republican presidential candidate right now (or their least un-favorite).\n\n\u201cDonald Trump seems to have realized that banning all abortions, shutting down the government, and defunding Planned Parenthood are extreme positions that are way too far outside the mainstream for even him to take,\u201d said Planned Parenthood spokesman Eric Ferrero in a statement.\n\nWhile the billionaire\u2019s comments have pleased the one side of the debate, they have predictably left pro-life activists angry and frustrated. That\u2019s because when pro-life activists talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, they aren\u2019t talking about that tiny exception in Medicaid; they\u2019re talking about zeroing out all taxpayer dollars that the organization receives.\n\nThey argue that any dollar that goes to the organization is, ultimately, supporting abortion.\n\n\u201c[B]ecause money is fungible, subsidizing any of the operations of the nation\u2019s largest performer of abortions (rather than re-routing that money to community health centers not engaged in abortions) is a boon to the merchants of death,\u201d wrote Dan McLaughlin at the conservative site RedState a few hours after Trump made his comments.\n\n(This isn\u2019t Trump\u2019s first clash with RedState. Last week, RedState Founder Erick Erickson disinvited Trump from a weekend confab for Republican contenders after Trump\u2019s comments about Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly.)\n\nMallory Quigley, communications director for the pro-life political group Susan B. Anthony List, echoed McLaughlin\u2019s remarks.\n\n\u201cWe have always opposed federal funding for Planned Parenthood because they are America\u2019s largest abortion business and any dollars that they receive free up other funding, which is available for abortion,\u201d Quigley told The Daily Beast.\n\nFederal tax dollars make up a huge part of the monies Planned Parenthood gets every year. In 2014, the organization received $528.4 million from the federal government. In contrast, it only took in $54.7 million in fees charged for services. The remainder of its funding for that year\u2014about $563 million\u2014came from nongovernment sources, private donors, and foundations.\n\nLosing taxpayer funding can impact the organization\u2019s effectiveness\u2014a scenario that has played out on the state level.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Wisconsin was forced to close five clinics\u2014none of which performed abortions, per the group\u2019s spokesperson\u2014after Gov. Scott Walker signed budgets eliminating its state funding.\n\nChris Taylor, a Wisconsin state representative and former public policy director at Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, told The Daily Beast that any further state funding cuts\u2014including losing access to federal Title X dollars\u2014\u201cwill certainly put more clinics at risk.\u201d\n\nFor pro-life activists, fewer clinics would be\u2014and has been\u2014a big win. So Trump\u2019s defense of federal funding for the organizations baffled pro-life activists who spoke with The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what he was thinking when he said that, to be honest with you,\u201d said Kerri Kupec of the conservative Christian group Alliance Defending Freedom.\n\n\u201cTo say, let\u2019s keep funding the quote unquote good aspects\u2014why are we making Americans and their hard-earned tax dollars complicit in this gross behavior that Planned Parenthood is engaging in, this callous disregard for human life?\u201d she added.\n\nOthers piled on too.\n\n\u201cAll his bankruptcies taught Donald Trump about such cheap accounting tricks,\u201d said John Zmirak, a pro-life columnist for the Christian news aggregation site The Stream. \u201cPlanned Parenthood is a criminal enterprise with roots in racist eugenics. If Trump wants taxpayers to subsidize their baby organ profiteering, he should be man enough to admit it.\u201d\n\nAnd Lila Rose, a prominent pro-life activist and head of the group Live Action, said Trump must not have watched the sting videos that renewed interest in defunding the organization.\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s vacillation on Planned Parenthood funding is deeply troubling, and reveals an ignorance about their horrific abortion practices,\u201d she said.\n\nStill more activists have been left scratching their heads.\n\nPenny Nance, who heads the group Concerned Women for America, emailed that she plans to ask him to clarify whether he supports shifting Planned Parenthood funds to community health centers that don\u2019t provide abortions, or whether he supports the status quo.\n\nThe Trump camp didn\u2019t respond to a request for clarification from The Daily Beast.\n\nAnd Bob Vander Plaats, an influential Iowa social conservative who heads The Family Leader, said his group \u201cwill probably want to discuss it with him further.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like a boys and girls home family services-type-deal that, well, we\u2019ve discovered that these boys and girls are being physically abused, but hey, they\u2019re all getting their GEDs, so let\u2019s keep funding them getting their GED,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, if you\u2019re doing wrong, you\u2019re doing wrong. And you don\u2019t get funded by the government for doing wrong.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:52.209+0000"}
{"entityId": 1492, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why does the right always go to the mat for big corporations who could give a damn about conservative values?\n\nA few years ago, liberal Bill Scher (my Bloggingheads sparring partner) penned a New York Times op-ed titled \u201cHow Liberals Win.\u201d His conclusion? They win when they co-opt big business. \u201cThe necessity of corporate support for, or at least acquiescence to, liberal policies,\u201d he wrote, \u201cis not a new development in the history of American liberalism. Indeed it has been one of its hallmarks.\u201d\n\nThat certainly rings true in a week where big businesses like Apple and Wal-Mart helped sink laws meant to defend religious liberty. (In both cases the laws have been amended\u2014but many conservatives believe the \u201cfix\u201d is worse than having no law on the books.) This is ironic, since conservatives are assumed to be in bed with big business\u2014and since at least one of the companies involved has been culturally associated with so-called red state values.\n\nAs Catherine Rampell noted at The Washington Post: \u201cEven Wal-Mart, not exactly known for its liberal values, came out against comparable legislation in its home state, saying it \u2018sends the wrong message about Arkansas.\u2019\u201d Apple CEO Tim Cook\u2019s public condemnation of the religious liberty laws was far less surprising. But even here, we see troubling hints about Senator Rand Paul\u2019s quixotic promise of bringing techies and Millennials\u2014blocs of voters that are supposedly libertarian-leaning\u2014into the fold. Good luck with that. When push comes to shove, these voters will disproportionally pull the lever for Hillary\u2014both to make history, and because they will be told that the Republican nominee\u2014yes, even if it\u2019s Rand!\u2014is a bigot. The promise that the GOP can merely tweak its image and find new allies is a long shot, at best\u2014and surely not one worth betraying its old allies\u2014social conservatives.\n\nMy theory is that there are essentially two groups of people you have to be wary of: big government and big business.\n\nBack to big business. For a while now, conservatives like Tim Carney have inveighed against \u201ccrony capitalism,\u201d pointing out that big business doesn\u2019t really like free markets. Big business is fine with killing off the competition by means of onerous governmental regulations only they can comply with. That\u2019s because they have the resources to hire the lawyers needed to navigate regulations, and the lobbyists who can help change the rules if necessary.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen other examples, however, of big business putting profit margins ahead of principle. Don\u2019t forget how big business sided on Obamacare. How could forcing millions of uninsured Americans to buy coverage from private companies not be good business for both the insurance and the pharmaceutical industries? Meanwhile, conservatives who oppose immigration reform often cite the support of big business for \u201cAmnesty.\u201d\n\nI think it\u2019s time that social conservatives also realize that big business isn\u2019t their friend, either. My theory is that there are essentially two groups of people you have to be wary of: big government and big business. Conservatives have typically obsessed over the former, while attempting to co-opt the latter. And who can blame them? Most of the other powerful coalition groups are natural allies on the left. As we have demonstrated, having big business on your political side is often the difference between winning and losing public policy battles.\n\nBut while conservatives might sometimes have to form a temporary alliance with business, they should remember that this isn\u2019t necessarily a natural alliance. If you\u2019re a conservative, you do have to worry about government (and be cognizant of the fact that bureaucrats don\u2019t care about you). But you must also distrust the people trying to sell you things.\n\nIf you\u2019re a social conservative trying to raise kids in the modern world, consider this: Who\u2019s trying to sell them destructive \u201cproducts\u201d ... violence, promiscuous sex, unhealthy lifestyles, bad food, etc.? It\u2019s probably not the government. It\u2019s much more likely to be big business trying to turn a profit. Do you think these fat cats actually care about you or your family? Hell, no. They\u2019re trying to make a buck.\n\nSo what does this mean in practice? Conservatives should ally with big business when it suits their interest. But remember, these folks aren\u2019t their friends. And when the left launches it\u2019s next liberal war on Wal-Mart, conservatives should perhaps consider that it\u2019s not worth wasting much political capital to defend the big box behemoth. What I\u2019m saying is that future arrangements can be seen as casual, not permanent. It\u2019s a hookup, not a marriage. Big business shouldn\u2019t be surprised by this.

{"entityId": 1493, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "So what if two rich gay hoteliers invited Ted Cruz to chat with them at their home? That\u2019s the kind of bridge building we need more of, not less.\n\nI don\u2019t like Ted Cruz. I disagree with him on a variety of issues, not the least of which is his opposition to marriage equality for gay couples. My dislike is predicated upon more than ideological concerns but temperamental ones as well. Cruz is a show-boater, not unusual in Washington, but he takes vanity to an absurd degree. As we saw in 2013, he was willing to shut down the government on a point of personal pique.\n\nMost politicians are vain and self-obsessed; fewer can be called megalomaniacs, which is how I would describe Cruz (\u201cwacko bird,\u201d as John McCain once characterized him, also captures Cruz well). Cruz would, to my mind, make a terrible president.\n\nNow that that\u2019s out of the way, let me say this: Like the vast majority of people who don\u2019t like Ted Cruz, I\u2019ve never met the junior senator from Texas. Were we to discuss the state of the world over a \u201cfireside chat,\u201d my impression of him would undoubtedly change: maybe for the better, quite possibly for the worse. But as someone with a natural curiosity about the world, and who believes that talking about political differences is far more productive (and interesting!) than shouting at or silencing those with whom I disagree, I would relish the opportunity to put Ted Cruz in the hot seat.\n\nIf only more gay people agreed. Because according to a large and vocal portion of the LGBT community, we can now add supping at the same table with someone who opposes gay marriage to the list of unforgivable homophobic acts worthy of condemnation and ostracism.\n\nThat\u2019s the lesson gleaned from the ordeal of Ian Reisner and Mati Weiderpass, two wealthy gay hoteliers, who hosted Cruz and his wife at their Manhattan apartment last week for said \u201cfireside chat.\u201d\n\nThe event was not a fundraiser, though it has mistakenly been called such (including by my Beast colleague Jay Michaelson), and so no one can claim that Reisner and Weiderpass were offering support to Cruz\u2019s nascent presidential bid.\n\nThe purpose of the meeting was twofold: to discuss the political situation in the Middle East and gay rights. On the former, the group was in agreement, with Riesner telling The New York Times that Cruz \u201cwas on point on every issue that has to do with national security.\u201d Regarding the latter, there was \u201cstrong\u201d disagreement, what with Riesner and Wiederpass both big-money contributors to gay rights causes.\n\nGay marriage \u201cis done\u2014it\u2019s just going to happen,\u201d Riesner told the Times. Ted Cruz probably disagrees with that triumphalism, but by all accounts, the group enjoyed a civil discussion in which differences were aired in a respectful and productive manner.\n\nIf Obama can meet with the likes of Raul Castro, who heads a regime that threw gay men into concentration camps where they were worked to death, why can\u2019t a couple of gay businessmen have dinner with a politician who opposes same-sex marriage?\n\nTo some on the gay left, however, such subtleties are irrelevant. Immediately, the gay outrage squad went into action mode, doing what it usually does: calling for economic boycotts and heads to roll. On Facebook, someone too cowardly to reveal his own name started a group demanding the boycott of lodging establishments owned by the two men. As of this writing, it has nearly 10,000 supporters. Elsewhere on Facebook, Riesner and Weiderpass were called \u201ccockroaches,\u201d likened to Nazi collaborators, and worse.\n\nReisner was the first to buckle. Initially defending his decision to host Cruz, he changed his tune after a major AIDS fundraiser and the New York City Gay Men\u2019s Chorus both canceled events scheduled to take place at venues he co-owns with Weiderpass. \u201cI made a terrible mistake,\u201d Reisner wrote on Facebook, prostrating himself before the bullies.\n\n\u201cI was ignorant, naive, and much too quick in accepting a request to co-host a dinner with Cruz at my home without taking the time to completely understand all of his positions on gay rights\u2026 I will try my best to make up for my poor judgement. Again, I am deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nWeiderpass was quick to follow Reisner in the groveling. \u201cI share Ian\u2019s remorse,\u201d he pleaded. \u201cI made a terrible mistake. Unfortunately, I cannot undo this. You taught me a painful but important lesson. The people that know me know the work that I have done over the last 20 years for the advancement of gay rights. Today, I came to realize that I might have nullified my past efforts and accomplishments in just one week.\u201d\n\nThe self-pitying over-dramatization was pathetic. Two decades of significant financial support to gay-rights causes\u2014certainly more substantial than what many of his online antagonists, whose notion of activism entails calling people names on social media, have ever done\u2014\u201cnullified\u201d because he broke bread with a senator whose view on gay marriage is essentially the same as the one expressed by Barack Obama a mere three years ago?\n\nThe pile-on resembles high school peer-pressure tactics, ironic considering the hell that many gay men\u2014and it\u2019s been mostly men going after Riesner and Weiderpass\u2014endure through their adolescent years. But it also, sadly, makes sense. Most gay men, from a young age up through early adulthood if not beyond, endure a degree of trauma that straight people can never truly understand. They are made to feel worthless and are often bullied by their peers; some are kicked out of their homes and disowned by those who are supposed to love them unconditionally.\n\nWhen I watch the overheated and frankly fanatical response to two gay men who simply invited an anti-gay politician and his wife into their home not to raise money for him but to understand him better and perhaps even make a positive impression that might influence his views, I can\u2019t help but think that the vituperation is a form of psychological projection. Bullied and taunted in high school, they\u2019re taking out their legitimate frustrations with an unfair, homophobic world on anyone remotely seen as upholding it: in this case, two fabulously wealthy gay guys who invited Ted Cruz into their house and didn\u2019t poison the fondue.\n\nThe mob-inducing qualities of social media, in which the more hateful a comment is the more likes and retweets it generates, exacerbates the problem, especially when the community is one predisposed to employ camp, drama and hysterics as substitute for argument.\n\nBut there\u2019s something deeper and frankly ominous about the gay left\u2019s response to this \u201cincident,\u201d an absurd word to bestow upon what ought to have been a simple dinner party. For an increasingly large segment of the gay activist community, the debate about homosexuality and society is no longer about equality before the law\u2014if it ever was. It\u2019s about enforcing groupthink. This attitude largely explains the furor over various religious liberty laws, which would, for example, permit some businessmen to abstain from offering their services at gay weddings.\n\nGays have won the cultural argument and are likely about to win the legal argument definitively this summer, when the Supreme Court is expected to find in favor of a national right to same-sex marriage. But some of us won\u2019t be content until every hillbilly baker in the country is obliged to make cakes for gay nuptials.\n\nNor is simple agreement with gay marriage sufficient. Even respectable elements of the gay left will not be satisfied until everyone accepts the full panoply of the progressive policy agenda, and, moreover, make a public show of that commitment. \u201cIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Cruz is anti-gay and also anti-social-safety net, anti-reproductive justice, and anti-affirmative action,\u201d wrote Michaelson. \u201cWhat extremely fortunate white gay men like Reisner and Weiderpass don\u2019t understand is that it\u2019s all one big package: the classism, the religious conservatism, the social conservatism\u2014these all go together.\u201d\n\nIt would seem to follow that being deemed an acceptable interlocutor is dependent upon your acceptance of the \u201cone big package\u201d that is contemporary progressivism. Are you pro-gay marriage but support tax cuts? Maybe you\u2019re a gay Catholic who opposes abortion, an issue that it no way affects gay men? Do you believe that citizens should be judged not by the color of their skin, but the content of their character, and therefore oppose race-based preferences in hiring? If so, are you then a sell-out, because \u201cthese all go together\u201d with being attracted to people of the same sex?\n\nThis thinking is the curse that the post-modern concept of \u201cintersectionality\u201d has plagued upon our culture, mandating that all forms of \u201coppression\u201d are \u201cinterconnected.\u201d What l\u2019affaire Cruz reveals is that it\u2019s not just opposition to gay marriage that the gay left finds intolerable\u2014it\u2019s any view with which they happen to disagree, including ones not even remotely related to legal equality. Ted Cruz could come out tomorrow in favor of gay marriage and announce his grand marshal-ship of the New York City gay pride parade and it would not make a lick of difference to many of the people now calling for boycotts of the city\u2019s gay clubs and hotels.\n\nHad Reisner and Weiderpass raised money for Cruz, then those gays up in arms would have more justification for their outrage. But all that the pair did was host the senator for \u201can open dialogue,\u201d in Reisner\u2019s words, something that, far from being devious was in fact admirable, as talking \u201cwith those who have differing political opinions is a part of what this country was founded on.\u201d If Obama can meet with the likes of Raul Castro, who heads a regime that threw gay men into concentration camps where they were worked to death, why can\u2019t a couple of gay businessmen have dinner with a politician who opposes same-sex marriage?\n\nIt\u2019s ironic that Reisner and Weiderpass are being lambasted for being greedy when their swift denunciation of Cruz and profuse apologies for having the gall to host him were so evidently motivated by fear of backlash against their various businesses (gay-themed hotels and bars), so heavily dependent upon gay community patronage. Had Reisner and Weiderpass stood their ground and ignored the braying hordes, they might have lost some business. But they would have proven their critics\u2014who accuse them of venality\u2014wrong. By caving in, they confirm that accusation.\n\nIn their anger at the hoteliers, many LGBTs are missing an important development, which is what Cruz allegedly said during the conversation. In addition to reiterating his well-known opposition to gay marriage, the Texas senator also told the assembled guests that, \u201cIf one of my daughters was gay, I would love them just as much.\u201d\n\nThat might seem like a low bar for those of us gay people lucky enough to have parents who accepted us as we are. But it\u2019s the right thing to say nonetheless\u2014an important thing to say\u2014and a far cry from what other Republican candidates with anti-equality views have uttered (and in some cases done) to their own gay children. By his mere visiting the home of a pair of prominent, openly gay businessmen, and with his comments about loving his hypothetical gay daughter, Cruz set an important marker for conservative Republican politicians.\n\nWhat\u2019s most troubling about this entire episode is that so many gay people believe it is perfectly acceptable to use illiberal tactics to threaten other gay people simply for the act of having a conversation. It\u2019s ironic, because gays won their newfound equality through free speech and free association, not bullying. For the younger generation of gays\u2014who know next to nothing about the gay experience in America\u2014the ignorance of this history is understandable, if lamentable. It\u2019s the behavior of the older ones I find unforgivable.\n\nSpeaking one\u2019s mind, particularly with those with whom we disagree, is the very lifeblood of democracy. Gay people won the argument about homosexuality because they decided to make one: forcefully, eloquently and repeatedly.\n\nThe riots at Stonewall were the spark, but they were hardly enough. It was people like Frank Kameny, fired from his job in the Army Map Service, who argued successfully that homosexuality should be removed from the American Psychiatric Association\u2019s list of mental disorders, and who lobbied the federal government to lift its ban on homosexuals working in the civil service.

{"entityId": 1494, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Two very different groups are trying to track down months' worth of Clinton emails. One wants to know about her reaction to Libyan violence; the other, about her aide Huma Abedin.\n\nAmong the hundreds of emails released by the State Department from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s private account, there is a conspicuous two-month gap. So far, there are no emails between Clinton and her State Department staff during May and June 2012, a period of escalating violence in Libya leading up to the September 11 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that left four Americans dead.\n\nA State Department spokesman told The Daily Beast that for the year 2012, only those emails related to the security of the consulate or to the U.S. diplomatic presence in Libya were made public and turned over to a House committee investigating the fatal Benghazi assault. But if that\u2019s true, then neither Clinton nor her staff communicated via email about the escalating dangers in Libya during those two crucial months. There were three attacks during that two-month period, including one that targeted the consulate. (Of course, email isn\u2019t the only or even the preferred way State Department officials communicate about sensitive issues\u2014especially if one of those officials is using a private server ill equipped to handle classified information.)\n\nEmails from that two-month period have also drawn outside interest for an entirely different reason. In the spring of 2012, a senior Clinton aide obtained a special exemption that allowed her to work both as a staff member to the secretary and in a private capacity for Clinton and her husband\u2019s foundation.\n\nUnderstandably, the State Department hasn't turned over any emails about the employment status of that aide, Huma Abedin, to the Benghazi Committee, which asked only for Libya-related material. Less understandable is Foggy Bottom's continued rebuffing of journalists' requests to obtain those messages under the Freedom of Information Act. The Associated Press has sued to obtain emails from Clinton\u2019s account about Abedin.\n\n\n\nBut the Abdein messages may come out eventually. Over the next several months, the State Department is slowly publishing online tranche after tranche of Clinton\u2019s emails. The tranche covering the spring and summer of 2012 is expected later this year.\n\nThe status of Clinton\u2019s emails has become an explosive political issue ever since The New York Times revealed that the then-Secretary of State was using a private email server to handle her official correspondence. Cybersecurity experts believe the homebrew system opened Clinton and her colleagues to targeting from online spies. The State Department and Intelligence Community Inspector Generals have asked the Justice Department to look into the possible disclosure of classified information.\n\nRegarding the security situation in Libya, there was plenty for Clinton and her team to discuss via email. On May 22, 2012, the International Red Cross\u2019s Benghazi office was hit by rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the International Red Cross was another attack that also involved us and threats to the compound there in Benghazi,\u201d testified Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, a senior State Department security chief in Libya, (PDF) before the House Oversight Committee in October 2012.\n\nThen, on June 6, an improvised explosive device detonated outside of the U.S. consulate, ripping a 12-foot-wide hole in the compound\u2019s wall and prompting officials to release a public warning on \u201cthe fluid security situation in Libya.\u201d\n\nYet the State Department has not produced any emails to or from Clinton about the improvised bomb.\n\nRepublicans on the House committee investigating the Benghazi attack have called the absence of any email communication noting the explosive attack at the U.S. consulate \u201cinexplicable.\u201d\n\nMichael Smallberg, an investigator at the Project on Government Oversight, told The Daily Beast that while special government employees are not uncommon, the lack of information about Abedin may be keeping alive questions about potential conflict of interest in her work for the secretary and the foundation\u2019s fundraising efforts.\n\n\u201cThere are gaps of months and months and months,\u201d Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, said in a March 8 interview.\n\n\u201cThe State Department transferred 300 messages exclusively reviewed and released by her [Clinton\u2019s] own lawyers,\u201d Gowdy added in a May 22 statement noting gaps in the email records. \u201cTo assume a self-selected public record is complete, when no one with a duty or responsibility to the public had the ability to take part in the selection, requires a leap in logic no impartial reviewer should be required to make and strains credibility.\u201d\n\nSince then, the Benghazi committee has recovered one email, largely about business interests in Libya, from June 2012 after subpoenaing Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal. The email from Blumenthal does not mention threats to the U.S. consulate, and there is no response from Clinton. The State Department subsequently gave the committee its copy.\n\n\n\nU.S. interests weren\u2019t the only ones being targeted in Benghazi. Five days after the improvised bomb damaged the consulate, an RPG hit a convoy carrying the British ambassador in Benghazi, wounding two bodyguards.\n\nThe United Kingdom and the Red Cross closed their facilities in Benghazi by the end of June 2012.\n\nFrom there, the violence directed at the U.S. escalated. In a cable dated July 9, 2012, U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens asked that the State Department provide a minimum of 13 security personnel for the U.S. embassy in Tripoli and the consulate in Benghazi, noting a heightened security threat. The State Department did not fulfill Stevens\u2019s request, a Senate Intelligence Committee report (PDF) later revealed.\n\nA Clinton aide didn\u2019t respond specifically to a request about the two-month email absence. But in a statement to reporters, Clinton spokesperson Nick Merrill noted, \u201cMore emails are slated to be released by the State Department next week, and we hope that release is as inclusive as possible.\u201d\n\nThe two-month period wasn\u2019t notable only for violence in Libya. It has been the subject of questions about Clinton\u2019s email and State Department records for a different reason.\n\nOn June 3, Abedin, a longtime Clinton aide and personal friend of the Clinton family, was given the status of a \u201cspecial government employee,\u201d which allowed her to stay on the State Department payroll while simultaneously working for the Clinton Foundation, Teneo, a consulting firm founded by Clinton confidant Doug Band, and as a private adviser to Clinton regarding her post-State Department transition.\n\nConflict-of-interest laws ordinarily would prohibit that arrangement, but the special designation exempted Abedin from some ethics rules.\n\nIn 2013, the AP filed a Freedom of Information Act request for State Department records on how Abedin obtained the special employee status. The news organization asked for emails about the matter.\n\nLast week, a federal judge gave the State Department one week to respond to the AP\u2019s two-year-old request. At midnight Tuesday, just before the judge\u2019s deadline, the department\u2019s lawyers submitted a declaration identifying about 68 pages of \u201cpotentially responsive\u201d documents.\n\nThat marked the first time that the department acknowledged, in its two-year dispute with the AP, the existence of any agency documents related to Abedin\u2019s arrangement.\n\nMichael Smallberg, an investigator at the Project on Government Oversight, told The Daily Beast that while special government employees are not uncommon, the lack of information about Abedin may be keeping alive questions about potential conflict of interest in her work for the secretary and the foundation\u2019s fundraising.\n\n\u201cUnless you come across any evidence to the contrary, there\u2019s no reason to believe she was abusing the special government position,\u201d Smallberg said. But, \u201cthe State Department has allowed those concerns to fester by withholding basic information,\u201d Smallberg added. \u201cEven if she did nothing wrong, secrecy breeds mistrust.\u201d\n\nState Department lawyers have argued that once all of Clinton\u2019s emails are released on the agency\u2019s website, following a vetting process that will take months, the AP\u2019s request for information about Abedin will have been satisfied.\n\nHowever, since some of the emails on Abedin that the AP wants likely fall within the June 2012 time frame, that might not be the case.\n\nAbout seven percent of Clinton\u2019s emails have been released. All the emails are scheduled to be released on a rolling, monthly basis until the last set is released in January 2016, to comply with an order by a different federal judge. The next release is tentatively scheduled for this Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE: This story has been modified to make clear that the State Department -- not the former Secretary of State herself -- is releasing Clinton\u2019s emails. The number of emails has been changed from \"approximately 2,000\" to \"hundreds,\" to more accurately reflect how many messages from 2012 have been released. The story now also notes that email is hardly the only way that State Department officials communicate. And the piece has been clarified to underscore that emails about Huma Abedin\u2019s employment status would not necessarily be in the tranche of messages released to the Benghazi Committee.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:52.685+0000"}
{"entityId": 1495, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Informed precisely by his Jewishness, Stewart made Palestinians into human beings. Hard to picture Noah being nearly as effective.\n\nI\u2019m sure that Trevor Noah, the 31-year-old South African comedian tapped to be the new host of The Daily Show after Jon Stewart retires this fall, was expecting to be compared to Stewart from a comedic point of view. I\u2019m sure he knew that he would hear how no one could fill Stewart\u2019s shows, etc. And perhaps he even expected the criticism over his past tweets that have led some to label him as misogynist or anti-Semitic or racially insensitive. That comes with the turf of this type of high-profile gig.\n\nWhat I doubt Noah could\u2019ve expected was that he would be pulled into the Palestinian-Israeli conflict within hours of Comedy Central naming as the new host. Even I was a bit surprised, but frankly I should have expected it.\n\nWe saw the conservative Daily Caller run a story titled \u201dIs New \u2018Daily Show\u2019 Host Trevor Noah Anti-Israel?\u201d The entire basis for the article was a 2010 comedic tweet by Noah: \u201cSouth Africans know how to recycle like Israel knows how to be peaceful.\u201d\n\nApparently to The Daily Caller, these 71 characters (including spaces) expose Noah\u2019s view that Israel \u201cis an inherently belligerent country.\u201d The article also went on to slam Jon Stewart for being anti-Israel because he had the audacity to mock certain policies of the Netanyahu administration. Of course, The Daily Caller slams the Obama administration\u2019s policies hourly; so does that make it anti-American?\n\nThe Jewish Forward, a progressive publication, took a much more nuanced approach asking, \u201dWhat Does Trevor Noah Think About Israel?\u201d It quoted tweets from liberal Jews who expressed concerns over the loss of Stewart and wondered what Noah\u2019s views would be on the Middle East conflict.\n\nHow often does a comedian taking a new gig have to pass a litmus test on support of Israel like a United States politician? But The Daily Show is no ordinary comedy show given that Stewart had so often spoke about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict in a way that resulted in cheers from the left and slams from the right.\n\nOf course, The Daily Caller slams the Obama administration's policies hourly; so does that make it anti-American?\n\nBut I think something else needs to be raised when it comes to Noah. He is South African and was raised during the final years of apartheid. I have no doubt that the Netanyahu-type Israel supporters know full well what that could mean.\n\nNoah has heard South African leaders like Nelson Mandela offer pro-Palestinian statements over the years such as \u201cSouth Africans would not feel free until Palestinians were free.\u201d Desmond Tutu has long been a critic of Israeli government policies toward the Palestinians. Noah is even probably aware that the United Nations passed a resolution in 1983 decrying Israel\u2019s conservative government headed by Menachem Begin for violating the worldwide boycott of South Africa\u2019s apartheid government by supplying it with support in \u201cthe military and nuclear fields.\u201d\n\nSo I get why the right-wing Israeli supports might have cause for concern. On the other hand, I understand why some progressives are in a tizzy over the loss of Stewart. He not only called out the Netanyahu administration in a way we had almost never seen before in the U.S. media, more importantly, Stewart talked about Palestinians in human terms.\n\nI wrote about this very issue during last summer\u2019s Gaza war in an article titled \u201cHow Jon Stewart made it okay to care about Palestinian suffering.\u201d I had never seen a comedic host, or almost any host in the U.S. media for that matter, discuss the suffering of the Palestinian people with such empathy. For example, Stewart criticized the 2009 Gaza war that left 700 Palestinians civilians dead, calling it a \u201ccivilian carnage Toyotathon.\u201d\n\nDuring that war, Stewart also mocked the conservative talking point that Palestinians in Gaza could just leave if they wanted to avoid being killed by the IDF\u2019s bombs: \u201cEvacuate to where?! Have you fucking seen Gaza? Israel blocked this border, Egypt blocked this border. What, are you supposed to swim for it?\u201d\n\n\n\nStewart also made it clear that criticizing the policies of the Netanyahu administration was not anti-Semitic. After all, Stewart is proudly Jewish.\n\nConsequently, Stewart gave many guests leeway to discuss the conflict in a way that we had never publicly engaged in before. And in my mind, Stewart at least contributed to the views we see of Netanyahu that are split along partisan and ideological grounds. For example, a poll released a few weeks ago found that only 17 percent of Democrats hold a favorable view of Netanyahu.\n\nAnd a new poll released yesterday finds that 58 percent of liberals support the establishment of a Palestinian State while only 30 percent of conservatives feel the same. I can\u2019t discount the influence Stewart may have had on some liberals to see Palestinians as deserving of self-determination thanks to his framing of them in terms of their humanity.\n\nBut here\u2019 s the thing both conservatives and my fellow progressives need to come to terms with: The Daily Show will never be The Daily Show once Stewart leaves. I don\u2019t mean Noah will not be funny or successful. It\u2019s just that on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Stewart\u2019s comedic views became part of the mainstream media\u2019s discussion of the issue because of who he was.\n\nAnd I have to go back again to Stewart being proudly Jewish. His criticism of Netanyahu\u2019s policies or his recognition of the Palestinians as human beings deserving of concern was at least infused by his Judaism. It gave his words more weight.\n\nI\u2019m sure Noah will do material about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict too And when he does, he will be cheered and jeered like Stewart. But I doubt it will be nearly as influential or inspiring. And for that reason, I will always long for the days where Stewart held court four nights a week at 11:00 PM.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:52.850+0000"}

Wow wow wow!\u201d Trump bellowed like a baritone Sally Field. \u201cUnbelievable! Unbelievaaaaable! Ugh, thank you. That\u2019s so beautiful.\u201d\n\nThen, he said, \u201cNow I know how the great Billy Graham felt, because it\u2019s the same feeling.\u201d Billy Graham, the conservative Christian evangelist and presidential spiritual adviser, got his start preaching outdoors on street corners, in front of bars, and in the parking lot of a dog racetrack. \u201cWe love Billy Graham,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe LOVE Billy Graham.\u201d In 2013, Trump attended Graham\u2019s 95th birthday in North Carolina, along with Rupert Murdoch, Glenn Beck, and Sarah Palin.\n\nAccording to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released hours before Trump\u2019s stop in Mobile, almost 32 percent of Republicans surveyed support Trump\u2014Jeb Bush, his establishment rival, boasts the support of just 16 percent of the GOP.\n\nHe said his book is his \u201csecond favorite book of all time,\u201d and then asked the crowd what his first favorite book is. He seemed to smirk before he shouted, \u201cTHE BIBLE!!!\u201d\n\nTrump explained to the crowd that he needed to host his event in the partially-empty stadium because initially, when it was scheduled to take place in a hotel, they were only expecting between 250 and 300 people. But in case you haven\u2019t been listening, Trump is a yooooge deal. When word got out about Trump\u2019s event, according to Trump, the hotel called to say they couldn\u2019t accommodate everyone. Next, Trump said, the campaign tried the Convention Center, but the size of Trump\u2019s expected crowd grew so much that it surpassed the venue\u2019s 10,000-person capacity. \u201cSo, we came here!\u201d Trump exclaimed, throwing his arms out. \u201cWe came here.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump surmised that Trump chose Mobile because it \u201clies on the Gulf Coast\u201d in close proximity to \u201cother big population centers\u201d like New Orleans and Tallahassee, and, less close but still not far, Birmingham and Atlanta.\n\nWhatever his reason for being there, Trump sure seemed at home. He laughed and joked with the crowd. At one point, he walked around to the front of the podium, reached down into the audience, and plucked a copy of his book, The Art of the Deal from the hands of a female fan. Trump, ladykiller, called her \u201cbeautiful.\u201d He said his book is his \u201csecond favorite book of all time,\u201d and then asked the crowd what his first favorite book is. He seemed to smirk before he shouted, \u201cTHE BIBLE!!!\u201d\n\nThis is Trump\u2019s way of assuring Southern voters that he is, if not a man of God, at least someone who respects God\u2019s branding\u2014because for Trump to concede that anybody, divine or otherwise, produced a better product than he did, he has to think at least as highly of them as he thinks himself. And that\u2019s as good as evangelicals are going to get from him.\n\nAt another point, Trump took his \u201cMAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d hat off his head and ran his fingers through his hair, joking that he would prove to the skeptics that it\u2019s real.\n\nLater, a plane flew overhead, and he glanced up to the sky. Earlier in the day, a pro-Jeb Bush plane had flown by, with the message, \u201cTRUMP 4 HIGHER TAXES. JEB 4 PREZ.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh, somebody stole my plane!\u201d Trump smiled, \u201cDammit.\u201d\n\nMost candidates give more or less the same exact speech everywhere they go.\n\nThey tell the same heartfelt anecdotes and the same jokes with the same inflections to poor saps in state after state, county after county, day after day. But Trump, as he noted in Mobile (in a speech which lasted over an hour), is yoooge and popular and therefore every single time he speaks, it\u2019s carried live on multiple television networks. So while he basically maintains his bullet points\u2014immigrants are bad, America is getting beat by China, I\u2019m really rich, Mexico is making America look bad, my military will be fabulous, did I mention I\u2019m really rich\u2014he rarely says the same thing twice.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s for that reason that Trump speeches never feel predictable, even though his biases are unwavering. He is a sputtering sprinkler of bigotry, flowery adjectives, and non sequiturs.\n\n\u201cIsrael? I loooooooove Israel,\u201d he said at one point while discussing foreign policy.\n\n\u201cWe have dummies we have dummies we have dummies!\u201d He complained of U.S. leaders.\n\nHis military, he said, will be \u201cso big and so great\u201d that \u201cnobody\u2019s gonna mess with us, folks\u2014nobody.\u201d\n\nWhile he warned that \u201cMexico is the new China,\u201d Trump informed his public that Nabisco, the creator of such beloved childhood snacks as Oreos, plans to move its factory there. \u201cI LOVE OREOS,\u201d Trump shouted. Then, sadly, \u201cI\u2019ll never eat them again.\u201d\n\nAt his announcement speech June 16 at Trump Tower in New York, he said, plainly, \u201cSo, just to sum up, I would do various things very quickly.\u201d\n\nFriday in Mobile, he summed it up again, \u201cI\u2019m going to make this country bigger and smarter and better and you\u2019re gonna love it!

That time desperately needs to be spent on transforming the classification system and modernizing electronic records retention policies, as promised in the Obama administration\u2019s second National Action Plan for the Open Government Partnership nearly two years ago.\n\nIt is hard to reconcile Clinton\u2019s actions with her speech at the 2012 opening session of the Open Government Partnership: \u201cIn the 21st century, the United States is convinced that one of the most significant divisions among nations will not be north/south, east/west, religious, or any other category so much as whether they are open or closed societies. We believe that countries with open governments, open economies, and open societies will increasingly flourish. They will become more prosperous, healthier, more secure, and more peaceful.\u201d\n\nShe was right then. It is essential to maintain the records of our policymakers for historical analysis so that the public can know what actions have been taken in our name by our leaders. Clinton did not maintain these records. The fact is she indisputably broke the rules, and although that is not a criminal offense, it certainly is a political one.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of revealing classified information to Congress, which is permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in the executive branch.\n\nEven more infuriating is the disparity of treatment between the politically powerful and everyday truth-tellers. High-level officials often receive little more than a tap on the wrist for mishandling classified information. But whistleblowers seeking to expose wrongdoing and protect the public are almost without exception subjected to overzealous investigations and prosecution.\n\nRather than focusing on the distinction between whether a person deliberately released classified information or not, the more appropriate lens is whether there was an intended public benefit for that disclosure, such as protecting public health or safety or revealing wrongdoing.\n\nOf course the Secretary of State had some classified information in her emails. As Bill Leonard, former director of the federal Information Security Oversight Office, told Reuters, information that foreign officials give U.S. officials in confidence is \u201cborn classified.\u201d\n\nAnd yes, the government is dramatically overclassifying information. Clinton herself tweeted that the government\u2019s ridiculous classification rules are the \u201creal problem.\u201d But rather than tackling the many problems with the classification system, or investigating Clinton through the post-Wikileaks \u201cinsider threat\u201d program created to investigate individuals who exploited, compromised, or made an unauthorized disclosure of classified information, the State Department has spent weeks defending their former boss and claiming dismissively that nothing was classified at the time anyway.\n\nGeneral Petraeus, who deliberately gave classified information to his lover/biographer, was afforded similar latitude, with Senator Feinstein going so far as to make a public plea for clemency in his case. In the end he was only given a paltry fine\u2014one that he will be able to pay off with less than one of his speaking engagement fees.\n\nThe Department of Defense Inspector General (IG) tried to bury, and then gutted, its own report that concluded then-CIA Director Leon Panetta had released classified information about the Osama bin Laden raid to the Zero Dark Thirty Hollywood producers. Panetta was never penalized despite the IG\u2019s findings.\n\nIn stark comparison, even national security whistleblowers who worked through proper channels, including reporting to their superiors, Inspectors General, and the Congress, are faced with a white-hot vindictive frontal attack from the government.\n\nNSA whistleblower Tom Drake and Justice Department whistleblower Thomas Tamm both had armed FBI agents raid their homes. Drake reported to the Pentagon IG and Congress about the NSA\u2019s unconstitutional and wasteful overreach through its domestic surveillance program (years before Edward Snowden). Tamm also challenged the legality of the government\u2019s warrantless wiretap program.\n\nTamm lost his clearance and his government career. Drake was prosecuted for espionage and lost his career after pleading to the misdemeanor of \u201cexceeding the authorized use of a computer.\u201d Both spent a fortune on attorneys.\n\nAir Marshal Robert MacLean had to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court to prove that he had a right to reveal unclassified information to a TV reporter about the TSA\u2019s decision to remove air marshals from high-risk flights after 9/11. His disclosure forced the TSA to reverse their plan and to better protect the public by keeping air marshals on cross-country flights. MacLean won, but he and his family had to put their lives on hold while he fought his case for years without a paycheck.\n\nLieutenant Colonel Jason Amerine is being investigated by the Army Criminal Investigation Division over accusations of revealing classified information to Congress, which is permitted by law to receive disclosures about wrongdoing in the executive branch. His disclosure to Congress led the White House to overhaul its hostage recovery policies. Yet his retirement from the military, after an extraordinary and decorated career in the Army, has been put on hold indefinitely as the investigation drags on.\n\nOur system now protects the powerful and attacks the heroes, both of which are fundamentally un-American.\n\nSo let\u2019s stop wasting time making politically expedient proclamations that serve no purpose but to score points for candidates. There are real issues all the campaigns should address: We need to dramatically shrink the incidence of and incentives for overclassification. We also need to apply a public interest balancing test so that when there is an alleged breach of classified information, the violation is weighed against the benefits of the information becoming known. And we need to level the playing field so that there aren\u2019t different accountability standards for those with clout and those without.\n\nIf the dialogue doesn\u2019t change, most federal employees who witnesses waste, fraud, or abuse will feel the chill and decide against stepping forward while the politically powerful class will continue to be rewarded and see their transgressions forgiven.\n\n\n\nDanielle Brian is the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight (POGO)\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:53.304+0000"}

In the wake of that decision, Congress stepped in to provide a uniform standard regarding government interference in the free exercise of religion, which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993.\n\nAt the signing ceremony extolling the virtue of the bill, Clinton offered: \u201cWhat this law basically says is that the government should be held to a very high level of proof before it interferes with someone\u2019s free exercise of religion. This judgment is shared by the people of the United States as well as by the Congress. We believe strongly that we can never, we can never be too vigilant in this work.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, to listen to the echo chambers today, you would think that Republicans have declared war on the LGBT community, when nothing of the sort has occurred. How did this happen? Quite simply, Democrats know how to manipulate both the press and get the desired political spin to constantly keep Republicans on the defensive while looking guilty.\n\nConsider the following: Just a few short years ago, President Barack Obama changed his stance on the right of same-sex couples to marry legally while mainlining his stance as Mr. Do-Good Liberal Hope and Change Leader. In 2008, candidate Obama said: \u201cI believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage,\u201d while in 2012 he \u201cevolved\u201d to: \u201cI\u2019ve just concluded that for me personally it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married.\u201d That Obama\u2019s decision appeared to be politically motivated in the midst of a re-election campaign was overlooked\u2014his was the position favored by the politically correct set, and his past sin for supporting marriage as the union between a man and a woman was ignored.\n\nFast-forward to the present day. In a private bill-signing ceremony, several supporters of Governor Pence\u2019s who strongly define marriage as between a man and a woman surrounded him as he put his signature on the new law. All of a sudden\u2014instant crisis and scandal: Republicans are bigots and against the LGBT community. Based on no facts, no evidence, nothing other than Democrat opponents asserting this as the truth. And Republicans largely cowered in response.\n\nIf Democrats and the media want to paint us as bigots, instead let\u2019s go on the offensive and clearly articulate why supporting the free exercise of religion has nothing to do with gay marriage.\n\nPence did himself no favors when he appeared on This Week with George Stephanopoulos to defend himself from charges of bigotry. In the relevant section from the interview, Stephanopoulos asks, \u201cDo you think it should be legal in the State of Indiana to discriminate against gays or lesbians?\u201d Rather than unequivocally answer no, Pence mumbled through an answer in which he said: \u201cGeorge\u2014you\u2019re following the mantra of the last week on line [media coverage] and I think you\u2019re trying to make this issue about something else.\u201d Pence\u2019s long-shot thoughts of running for president next year have now officially been extinguished in the political fallout created and promoted by Democrats and their media enablers looking for discriminatory intent where none existed.\n\nThe hypocrisy of Democratic officials is patently offensive when it comes to RFRA. Connecticut Governor Dan Malloy sent not one but two tweets out patting himself on the back for signing an executive order banning state-sponsored travel to Indiana because of their \u201cdiscriminatory practices\u201d in passing a RFRA statute (the ban was lifted after Indiana adjusted its law). Did the media bother to inform the public that Connecticut has an almost identical law on the books as Indiana\u2019s recently passed law? No, of course not. People in glass houses shouldn\u2019t throw stones: Why is it fine for Connecticut to have a RFRA statute in place while the governor calls for a boycott of Indiana for passing a nearly identical measure?\n\nNews flash to Republicans: Get your act together and know how to navigate potentially treacherous political waters. If Democrats and the media want to paint us as bigots, instead let\u2019s go on the offensive and clearly articulate why supporting the free exercise of religion has nothing to do with gay marriage. It is nearly impossible to win on the political gridiron when Democrats are running downfield with the wind at their back while Republicans labor upfield with the wind in our faces.

Bush as CNN\u2019s White House correspondent from 2006 to 2011.\n\nIt was Henry\u2014after being warned never to shout at Bush, who preferred to call on reporters from a list of pre-selected names\u2014who went ahead and shouted anyway at his first Rose Garden news conference, asking about the employment future of beleaguered Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and eliciting Bush\u2019s famous phrase, \u201cI\u2019m the decider.\u201d\n\nFormer Bush White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, now a regular on Fox News\u2019s The Five, recalls that Henry\u2019s pointed questioning in the briefing room frequently made her scowl\u2014a sour expression captured in photographs\u2014while she affectionately refers to him as \u201ca stone in my shoe.\u201d\n\nFormer CNN-U.S. president Jonathan Klein, who was Henry\u2019s boss, calls him \u201ca real old-style reporter who shows no fear or favor\u2014and it can be annoying to the target...He\u2019s just an aggressive son of a bitch when it comes to confronting politicians\u2014and that\u2019s exactly what you want in your reporters.\u201d\n\nHenry has clearly been sharpening his son-of-a-bitchiness while he doubles as the Fox News reporter assigned to chase candidate Clinton to Iowa, New Hampshire and beyond.\n\n\u201cI think \u2018Did you wipe the server?\u2019 is a pretty direct, fair, blunt question \u2026 That\u2019s straight-up journalism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re just trying to do your job, and sometimes it becomes a little more contentious,\u201d says Henry, who is occasionally giving Clinton fits with his headline-making interrogations, such as last week\u2019s dogged grilling of the candidate, during a stopover in Las Vegas, concerning her use of a private email server while secretary of state.\n\n\u201cBut, Ed, you\u2019re not listening to me!\u201d an exasperated Clinton chided at one point, adding, \u201cEd, I know you want to make a point,\u201d as Henry kept asking about the FBI\u2019s criminal investigation of the State Department\u2019s email practices, and Clinton\u2019s press secretary, Nick Merrill, kept trying to cut him off, saying \u201cWe gotta go!\u201d and \u201cThanks very much!\u201d\n\n\u201cDid you wipe the server?\u201d Henry persisted.\n\n\u201cLike with a cloth or something?\u201d Clinton replied\u2014a jokey answer that, judging from the viral attention it received, proved to be too clever by half.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a simple question,\u201d Henry rejoined.\n\nWhen Clinton turned her back on the press gaggle and walked off, NBC News\u2019s Kristen Welker called out that the email issue \u201cisn\u2019t going to go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one talks to me about it other than you guys,\u201d Clinton protested over her shoulder, shrugging in disgust\u2014the other viral quote from her campaign that day.\n\n\u201cBut there was no arm-waving, there were no raised voices,\u201d Henry says. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is that sometimes people believe that TV correspondents are trying to make moments, playing to the camera to force a fight. But I think \u2018Did you wipe the server?\u2019 is a pretty direct, fair, blunt question. She repeatedly refused to answer it and then spent three or four days trying to clean it up. That\u2019s called \u2018news.\u2019 That\u2019s straight-up journalism.\u201d\n\nBack in May, Henry was also the fly-in-the-ointment who interrupted a staged panel discussion with pre-screened Iowans to demand that Clinton\u2014after 40,150 minutes of unavailability\u2014start taking questions from the press.\n\n\u201cI might. I have to ponder it. I will put it on my list for due consideration,\u201d said the candidate, who ultimately relented and, at Henry\u2019s prompting, held her first news conference in a month.\n\n\u201cShe had gone 28 days without taking a question,\u201d Henry recalls. \u201cThey [the campaign staff] got a little mad at me then, because they felt like I was interrupting her. But we had gone, myself and other reporters, to a series of these events, and if you don\u2019t interrupt, she waves and she\u2019s out the back door. And at some point it becomes ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe adds: \u201cIt sounds goofy, but it\u2019s not just for a \u2018moment,\u2019 it\u2019s for the American people to get some answers to these questions\u2014whether it\u2019s email, whether it\u2019s the Clinton Foundation, whether it\u2019s her economic plan. And I would argue that it\u2019s not serving her well to not take questions for so long. Because now, when she does get questions, she\u2019s struggling.\u201d\n\nWhile Henry says he has decent dealings, and even enjoys an occasional off-the-record drink, with members of Clinton\u2019s senior staff\u2014including a bantering relationship with her closest aide, Huma Abedin\u2014he barely knows the candidate.\n\n\u201cIt seems like she knows my name\u2014she said \u2018Ed\u2019 several times,\u201d he quips about their Las Vegas encounter. \u201cBut I\u2019m more worried about doing caricature coverage, where you\u2019re just doing \u2018She\u2019s got an email problem,\u2019 or \u2018She\u2019s this robot who wants to be president of the United States.\u2019 And if you don\u2019t really get to know the candidate, it\u2019s really hard to understand where they\u2019re coming from...To me she\u2019s a distant figure.\u201d\n\nHenry remains mystified that given his perch on the highest-rated cable news network, he was excluded, as the campaign formally got underway in April, from a couple of off-the-record social events in Washington and Brooklyn between Clinton staffers and political reporters\u2014although it seems clear that if they had to do it all over again (much like the candidate\u2019s recent regrets over her private server), the Clintonistas would have invited him.\n\nHis tie loosened and his suit jacket slung over a chair, Henry is nursing an iced coffee in a sidewalk caf\u00e9 a couple of blocks from Fox News\u2019s Manhattan mothership.\n\nAlthough he doesn\u2019t have his own show, Henry, who is based in Washington, appears pretty much daily on Fox News, often in prime time, and is one of the cable network\u2019s more recognizable franchise players.\n\nWhen he\u2019d sat down a few minutes earlier, another patron\u2014a middle-aged New Yorker dressed much like Henry\u2014had jauntily called out to him, \u201cKeep giving Hillary hell, Ed!\u201d\n\nHenry walked over and thanked the man.\n\n\"Ed\u2019s relentless pursuit of the truth has been on display throughout his coverage of the Clinton campaign, the Obama White House and the Bush administration,\u201d says Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes. \u201cHe\u2019s a tenacious reporter whose ability to ask the hard-hitting questions without losing his likability has enabled him to stand out among the Washington press corps.\u201d\n\nHenry is certainly (as presidential candidate Obama once said about his 2008 rival, Clinton) likable enough; in 2012, he managed to get himself elected president of the White House Correspondents Association, demonstrating that he has political chops of his own.\n\nIt\u2019s an influential post requiring a collegial personality and enough backbone to aggressively argue the case with the president\u2019s spin-meisters for increased access and transparency at the White House, but whose most valuable perk is the authority to parcel out tables to various media outlets at the association\u2019s annual black-tie dinner at the Washington Hilton.\n\nNeedless to say, Fox News did very well table-wise at the 2013 dinner, at which Henry and Fox News Executive Vice President Michael Clemente schmoozed with Obama for three hours on the dais. Henry, however, points out that NBC News obtained as many tables as Fox\u2014an astronomical 14 in the jam-packed basement ballroom.\n\nHenry\u2014who covered Senator John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign for CNN before switching beats to the Obama administration\u2014said there was a noticeable change in the White House attitude toward him after Ailes and Clemente recruited him to Fox during the summer of 2011, as Obama\u2019s reelection effort was ramping up.\n\nFor one thing, he quickly became an especially juicy target for Media Matters, the left-leaning press watchdog group run by Hillary Clinton acolyte David Brock, which started \u201cpainting [Henry] as a right-wing nut job,\u201d according to an article in The Wire, which called the denunciation \u201ca little silly.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Henry clashed repeatedly in the briefing room with White House Press Secretary Jay Carney, a former Time magazine correspondent who had left journalism to work for Vice President Biden, and then was chosen to replace departing Obama loyalist Robert Gibbs.\n\n\u201cPretty awful,\u201d Henry says about his relationship with Carney. \u201cI think Jay is very condescending\u2026Jay could never see past \u2018You\u2019re at Fox, you\u2019re doing it because you\u2019re at Fox.\u2019 He would never look at my record.\u201d\n\nHenry adds: \u201cWith Jay, \u2018Fox\u2019 was always a failsafe. If he didn\u2019t have you on the facts, he was on defense\u2026As a former reporter, Jay went out of his way to let us know, \u2018I\u2019m not on your team, I\u2019m not with the news media, I\u2019m with the White House now.\u2019\u201d\n\nBy contrast, Henry says he enjoys good rapport with Carney\u2019s successor, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest.\n\n\u201cJosh and I have had our moments, and he\u2019s tough but fair. Josh doesn\u2019t throw in a cheap shot,\u201d Henry says. \u201cJosh is much more professional and at the end of the day he does a better job for his boss. He keeps it on the level. He\u2019ll fight you, but he doesn\u2019t make it personal.\u201d\n\nCarney, who today works for Amazon as the online retail giant\u2019s senior vice president for global corporate affairs, fires back: \"More than any Fox News reporter I dealt with, Ed carried the network's political agenda into the briefing room, day after day.\"\n\nThat, however, appears to be a minority view (and despite the proliferation of Republican and right-leaning personalities on Fox News\u2019s programming, the network has long insisted that its straight-news operation has no political agenda. \u201cDoesn\u2019t Jay have bigger things to worry about right now than obsessing about Fox?\u201d says a Fox News spokesperson).\n\nEarnest, for one, tells The Daily Beast: \u201cEd has earned his reputation as a tough reporter, but I\u2019ve also found that although we often disagree, he\u2019s a professional. That means we have an effective working relationship...He\u2019s doing his job effectively, and we\u2019re doing our job effectively...Anybody who\u2019s seen Ed ask a question on camera in the briefing room knows he is not going to pull any punches, but he will usually let you give an answer\u2014which I don\u2019t think I can say about all of his colleagues at other news outlets, by the way.\u201d\n\nClinton campaign spokesman Nick Merrill, meanwhile, emailed: \u201cEd can be as colorful as his pocket squares in a press conference, but we like him all the same. He's always the guy that picks up the phone to check his facts with you, and on the \u2018rare\u2019 occasion that FOX airs something we find to be factually flawed, he's there to hear us out, and address it with his colleagues.\u201d\n\nLis Smith, former director of rapid response for Obama\u2019s reelection campaign and currently press secretary to presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley, calls Henry \u201ceminently fair. He doesn\u2019t fit the stereotype of the Fox News reporter who shows up and shoves a camera in your face...I think he\u2019s a huge asset to Fox because he comes across as someone who approaches his reporting with an unbiased perspective.\u201d\n\nHenry, who is married to NPR Washington producer Shirley Hung and has a teenage son and daughter from a previous marriage, hails from Queens and grew up, the son of a grocer and bookkeeper, in the Long Island town of Deer Park. After graduating from St. John the Baptist High School\u2014where he was taught by Franciscan friars and wrote for the school newspaper, The Promethean\u2014he attended Siena College in Albany.\n\nHe left before graduation for a $250-a-week job with Jack Anderson, the famed investigative Washington columnist who was entering his dotage and whose column was published in The Washington Post\u2019s comics section. \u201cSo I know what it\u2019s like to be an outcast sometimes,\u201d Henry says, noting that he caught the journalism bug in a Senate hearing room one night in 1991 as embattled Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas complained of a \u201chigh-tech lynching.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought, wow, I want to be in the middle of this,\u201d Henry recalls. \u201cThe whole thing was a spectacle, but there were real issues on the line.\u201d\n\nAfter securing his college degree by attending night classes at American University, he went on to work for Roll Call, eventually becoming managing editor of the Congress-focused newspaper, and sought out career advice from influential pundit Robert Novak, who, over breakfast at the Army-Navy Club in 2003, told Henry to look into television.\n\nIt was the curmudgeonly Novak, Henry says, who helped him move to CNN, where Novak was an on-air contributor. In a celebrated incident two years later, Henry was anchoring a live segment with Novak when the columnist took offense at a comment by fellow panelist James Carville, uttering the word \u201cbullshit\u201d and storming off the set\u2014before Henry could ask him about his role in the outing of CIA employee Valerie Plame, the subject of a criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cNovak flipped out and started yelling at me, \u2018How could you do this?\u2019\u201d\u2014referring to Henry\u2019s intention to grill his onetime mentor and advocate about the awkward Plame incident. \u201cBut I thought I was just doing my job.\u201d\n\nStill steaming about the encounter shortly before his death, Novak called Henry in his memoir, The Prince of Darkness, a \u201cduplicitous phony.\u201d\n\nA decade later, Henry says he feels fortunate to be working at Fox and \u201cexhilarated\u201d by the constant adventure of campaign coverage, but is nurturing higher ambitions for his career after the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cYou always want to take on more, and you always want to be rewarded for it,\u201d he says, noting that he re-upped last years and every so often talks with Ailes about his future. Apparently a program of his own is not in the cards just yet.\n\n\u201cEvery day part is spoken for and Mr. Ailes has told me that,\u201d he says. \u201cI love all my colleagues. We\u2019re winning every hour. He doesn\u2019t need anybody else. Hopefully there will be a new challenge that he\u2019ll throw my way, and I will eagerly accept it.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:53.643+0000"}

There\u2019s only one problem: Clinton did too.\n\nSometimes in the course of campaigns, opposing sides circulate information that comes back to bite them.\n\nThis is one of those times.\n\nOn Wednesday, Democrats were up in arms over comments Jeb Bush wrote in his 1995 book that expressed criticism of divorce that occurred without a clear cause.\n\n\u201c[No]-fault divorce quickly became a tool for those who used the law not to escape physical or mental cruelty but to pursue career dreams and trade in their wives for something more appealing,\u201d he wrote in Profiles in Character.\n\nCue the outrage.\n\n\u201cBush has to hope the book stays out of print,\u201d wrote Joan Walsh, Salon\u2019s editor-at-large.\n\nAnd at the Washington Post, opinion writer Catherine Rampell criticized Bush\u2019s \u201chistrionics about no-fault divorce\u201d and called his views on the issue \u201cstrange and/or relatively retrograde.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, Democratic communicators pushed the \u201cJeb is anti-divorce\u201d narrative calling it \u201cinsane.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing:\n\nIn her 1996 book, It Takes A Village, Hillary Clinton took the same position.\n\n\n\nOops.\n\nLet\u2019s compare.\n\nBush argued that no-fault divorce generally hurt kids, and that lawmakers might want to consider making parents to be more circumspect about ending their marriages.\n\nIn a 1996 Orlando Sentinel op-ed, Bush wrote that Florida\u2019s no-fault divorce law provided important protections for women in abusive situations but also \u201cthrew the baby out with the bath water.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn real terms, divorce meant parents spending less time with their children,\u201d he continued. \u201cAccording to a number of studies, the absence of one parent in the household has been enough to result in an increased propensity for crime, suicide, out-of-wedlock births, depression and truancy.\u201d\n\nHe then noted that some argued for \u201can extended mandatory cooling-off period\u201d before letting parents with minors finalize their divorces, but added he wasn\u2019t sure the cooling-off periods would be good policy.\n\nUltimately as governor, he didn\u2019t move to implement such a rule.\n\nThe AP reported in 2002 that \u201cBush said that he does not want that [no-fault divorce] law changed, saying it could lead to abusive situations if it is more difficult for couples to split up.\u201d\n\nNow, in her 1996 book, It Takes A Village, Hillary Clinton argued a strikingly similar position.\n\n\u201c[W]ith divorce as easy as it is, and its consequences so hard, people with children need to ask themselves whether they have given a marriage their best shot and what more they can do to make it work before they call it quits,\u201d she wrote, echoing Bush\u2019s concerns about how divorce impacts children. \u201cFor this reason, I am ambivalent about no-fault divorce with no waiting period when children are involved. We should consider returning to mandatory \u2018cooling off\u2019 periods, with education and counseling for partners.\u201d\n\nSo both Bush and Clinton were open to\u2014but ultimately noncommittal about\u2014policies designed to make it harder for parents of minor children to get divorced.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn one sense, Clinton went even further than Bush on the issue, suggesting in her book that divorce is a public health problem.\n\n\u201cI admire the way the Parent Education Program in Columbus, Ohio, treats divorce as a public health issue,\u201d she wrote.\n\nAnd she even invoked Bill Bennett, the Reaganite and conservative culture warrior, to make the case against divorce.\n\n\u201cOne does not have to agree with all the remarks of former Secretary of Education William Bennett to welcome his acknowledgment before the Christian Coalition that divorce is hard on children,\u201d she wrote.\n\nClinton didn\u2019t leave her anti-divorce rhetoric in the 90\u2019s.\n\nDuring a Senate floor speech in 2004 arguing against a constitutional amendment that would have barred same-sex marriage (she was opposed to gay marriage until 2013), she invoked no-fault divorce again.\n\n\u201cNow, if we were really concerned about marriage and the fact that so many marriages today end in divorce, and so many children are then put into the incredibly difficult position of having to live with the consequences of divorce,\u201d she said. \u201cPerhaps 20, 30 years ago we should have been debating an amendment to the Federal Constitution to make divorce really, really hard, to take it out of the states\u2019 hands and say that we will not liberalize divorce, we will not move toward no-fault divorce, and we will make it as difficult as possible because we fear the consequences of liberalizing divorce laws.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in the speech, she was explicit about her concerns over the divorce rate.\n\n\u201cWe are living in a society where people have engaged in divorce at a rapid, accelerated rate,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all know it is something that has led to the consequences with respect to the economy, to society, to psychology, and emotion that so often mark a young child\u2019s path to adulthood.\u201d\n\nIt just goes to show when your potential nominee has a long record, it might pay to check it before you start questioning the other candidate\u2019s sanity.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:53.951+0000"}

He shouldn\u2019t be talking like that, of course, but neither should the press be particularly interested in the personal lives of politicians unless criminality is involved or the matter at hand is directly relevant to their elected office.\n\nNo, it\u2019s really the way Grayson talks in the strictly political sphere that is most troubling. In the early 1990s, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan famously complained that the country was \u201cdefining deviancy down.\u201d The problem, Moynihan argued, was that \u201cwe have been redefining deviancy so as to exempt much conduct previously stigmatized, and also quietly raising the \u2018normal\u2019 level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard.\u201d\n\nI actually don\u2019t buy Moynihan\u2019s large argument (much of what he considered deviant, we now rightly recognize as individuality, fashion, or simple expression), but I think his phrase is useful when discussing how politicians act and talk. We put up with a lot more crap from pols than we used to and that tolerance is not leading either to better outcomes or deeper discussions of important topics.\n\nAs the self-styled \u201cCongressman With Guts,\u201d Grayson has yet to reach bottom when it comes to throwing low blows. In 2009, for instance, while appearing on Jones\u2019 show and talking about the Federal Reserve, he called Linda Robertson, an adviser to Ben Bernanke, \u201ca K Street whore.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he inveighed, \u201cthe only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, and this lobbyist, this K Street whore, is trying to teach me about economics.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Grayson was just nervous in his freshman year in Congress and trying to show off a bit too much. That same year he turned in the performance for which he is probably still best-known: his executive summary of the Republican health care plan alternative to Obamacare as \u201cIf you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is this: Die quickly.\u201d He delivered that message, complete with props, from the floor of Congress.\n\nIn a tough 2010 re-election campaign, Grayson ran ads calling his Republican opponent, Daniel Webster, a draft dodger and, more improbably, \u201cTaliban Dan,\u201d in a nod to Webster\u2019s social conservatism. Factually incorrect and overflowing with duplicitous editing, the commercials are pitch-perfect parodies of negative ads and are widely believed to have helped cost Grayson the election. Florida voters, accustomed as they are to reading about \u201cFlorida Man,\u201d don\u2019t always want his spiritual cousin representing them in Congress (Grayson would return to Washington in 2013, representing a newly redrawn 9th district).\n\n\u201cHere I am,\u201d he inveighed, \u201cthe only member of Congress who actually worked as an economist, and this lobbyist, this K Street whore, is trying to teach me about economics.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m about as far from good-government types who bemoan the death of civil discourse as you can get (in fact, just recently I published a piece headlined \u201cClinton Aide Sid Blumenthal is the Human Equivalent of a Semen-Stained Dress\u201d). And while I find Grayson\u2019s economic positions generally idiotic, I actually share his views on many things, ranging from marriage equality to demilitarizing American police to curtailing the surveillance state to ending mindless overseas interventions. (I\u2019m not convinced, however, that the vile Dick Cheney has \u201cblood that drips from his teeth,\u201d as Grayson once testified on MSNBC.)\n\nIf he wasn\u2019t so consistently a jackass, who knows? He might actually be more effective at creating the country he wants to live in and building bridges across raging waters. But I guess jackasses have to jack, amirite?\n\nMembers of Congress should be held to higher standards than regular voters. They should be expected to live their lives more cleanly than the rest of us and they should talk to one another respectfully, especially on topics where the disagreements are the deepest. I\u2019m not talking about the patently phony decorum that gets trotted out every time a senator starts clearing his throat as he ascends the dais to lecture a nearly empty chamber about the excellence of his colleagues and the desperate need for a traffic light to be fixed in his hometown.\n\nNo, I\u2019m talking about the sort of truly honest and open political debate we desperately need in Washington. It\u2019s just not going to happen if our elected officials are steeped in the extremist \u201cwingnut rhetoric\u201d that is properly left to citizens, journalists, and the rest of us with an opinion and an Internet connection.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Alan Grayson, of course, even if he is a little too Florida Man for comfort. With the possible exception of presidential elections (I\u2019m thinking 2000 and maybe 1960), we get whom we vote for in the United States. And to the extent that our representatives actually represent us, we\u2019ve got as much to be contrite about as does the honorable congressman from Florida.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:54.085+0000"}
{"entityId": 1502, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "He\u2019s not going to win, OK? But if he just gets America talking about free college for all, his candidacy will have accomplished plenty.\n\nSo now at least there\u2019s a primary on the Democratic side. Bernie Sanders is in. And Martin O\u2019Malley is announcing later this week that he\u2019s doing the same.\n\nIt all hardly means that Hillary Clinton is likely to lose the nomination\u2014the chances of that have just shot up from 0 percent to, what, 3.8 percent. Still, she will have to fight for votes now. Alabama isn\u2019t likely to lose to Coastal Carolina, but at least it\u2019s a game, and Coastal Carolina shows up and fights, and Alabama has to get out there on the field and execute.\n\nThe thing that is commonly said about Sanders and O\u2019Malley is that they can push Clinton to the left, but I\u2019m not sure even that is true. At best, it\u2019ll depend on the issue. Take the Pacific trade deal. My expectation is that Clinton will eventually announce that she\u2019s for it. Given that her State Department helped negotiate it, that would seem the logical place for her to land.\n\nBut even if she did come out against it, is it going to be because of Sanders and O\u2019Malley? I say doubtful. It\u2019s going to be because it becomes clear to her campaign that she forfeits more among liberals in enthusiasm than she gains among centrists in credibility or donations or what have you. That has more to do with the grassroots and the unions and a certain non-candidate (Elizabeth Warren) than it does with her opponents.\n\nBut all that said, here\u2019s the important thing that long-shot candidates can bring to the dance: They can introduce an issue or way of seeing a problem that voters just weren\u2019t thinking about before and the front-runner won\u2019t have the fortitude to talk about because it\u2019s seen as too risky. And even if they don\u2019t get the front-runner to embrace their position, they can create a reality in which the candidate gets asked a lot of questions about it and with any luck it becomes a position she ultimately has to embrace.\n\nIn free college for all, Sanders has the issue. Some caveats: First of all, \u201cfree\u201d doesn\u2019t necessarily mean completely free, and \u201cfor all\u201d definitely doesn\u2019t mean for all. Sanders means free when he says free, but some liberal higher-education experts wonder whether totally free is a wise course of action\u2014an education has a value, after all, and surely some price point is reasonable. So maybe \u201creally inexpensive\u201d would do just fine. But as for the \u201cfor all\u201d part, even Sanders doesn\u2019t mean that. He\u2019s talking about public universities only. So Penn State yes, Penn no, UCLA yes, USC no, and so on.\n\nI hope this becomes the center of his stump speech, and I hope he uses his time on those six debate stages to push it.\n\nThere are reasons to proceed with caution here, because such a proposal would have enormous knock-on effects. The downsides would hit small private colleges\u2014and many of these are singular and valuable institutions in this country\u2014hard. The really elite private schools probably wouldn\u2019t feel much impact, but the smaller ones would almost certainly have to lower their tuition, and they just aren\u2019t built for that right now. If UNC-Chapel Hill and NC State became free or near-free, it wouldn\u2019t hit Duke, which is a national school; but it would harm and even threaten the existence of some of North Carolina\u2019s smaller 30 or more private schools.\n\nBut even so, that could all be finessed. The far bigger problem we face as a nation is crushing student debt, which is up around a staggering $1.2 trillion. Tuition costs have been rising far higher than inflation, and even far higher than health-care costs\u2014almost twice as fast. And the most important statistic of all in many ways: Since the economic meltdown especially, state governments have cut back dramatically on aid to higher education. Washington has stepped in to pick up some of this slack, but state legislatures used to really care about their public universities, before the Koch Brothers started buying them up (the legislatures, I mean). More states simply have to return to the old vision of seeing their universities as the great public trusts they are.\n\nSanders\u2019s bill would address this last point by requiring states to pay for one-third of the (surprisingly modest, by my lights) price tag of around $70 billion. The feds would pay the other two-thirds. That\u2019s about $47 billion. As higher-ed expert Jordan Weissman has written, Washington now spends about $60 billion a year administering and funding its various student loan programs. In theory it\u2019s just a matter of moving some of that money around, although the higher education world, like any other, has extremely powerful lobbyists\u2014the private schools and the for-profit schools both lobby heavily\u2014so reform would be a heavy lift.\n\nBut let\u2019s give Sanders big props for putting this out there. I hope this becomes the center of his stump speech, and I hope he uses his time on those six debate stages to push it. It\u2019s my sense that it could be pretty popular\u2014especially among Democratic primary voters, but I think even among independents and some Republicans, once it\u2019s explained to them that the cost isn\u2019t nearly as high as they probably think it is. I\u2019m not sure most people would buy \u201cfree,\u201d because of the folk wisdom about there being no such thing as a free lunch. However, the idea that a public-university education should be something that a kid ought to be able to pay for by working a summer job? I think 85 percent of the country would back that. And if Sanders can effectively press his case for a few months, maybe Hillary will back it, too.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:54.338+0000"}

This is what some women find offensive, Mr. Trump, is that you go to looks.... It's something out of Mad Men, sir.\u201d\n\nTrump did not apologize, and pundits on Meet the Press said his behavior does nothing to help the GOP bring in more female voters.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s important to remember the Republican presidential nominee hasn\u2019t won women since 1988,\u201d said Heather McGhee, president of the liberal economic policy group Demos. \u201cSo this is a very deep problem for the party.\u201d\n\nHer claim about the GOP\u2019s 26-year losing streak for the female vote rates True.\n\nRepublicans have not won a larger share of female voters than Democrats since the 1988 election, when George H.W. Bush earned just 1 percentage point more of the female vote than Democrat Michael Dukakis, according to datasets that rely on surveys, which include exit polling data, from several sources.\n\nRepublicans have not won a larger share of female voters than Democrats since the 1988 election.\n\nFor comparison, Obama won 56 percent of the female vote in 2008, and 55 percent in 2012.\n\nRepublicans commanded a larger share of women voters from the suffrage era to the 1950s, but experts say the growth of the feminist movement, increased labor force participation among women, and support for government programs for the poor, children and families have pushed more women to the Democratic side.\n\nOther factors include the rise of the powerful pro-choice PAC Emily\u2019s List in the 1980s and 1990s and the controversy over Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas, added Karen O\u2019Connor, a professor of political science at American University's Women & Politics Institute.\n\n\"Women were very angry,\" O\u2019Connor said of the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s questioning of Thomas\u2019 former employee, Anita Hill, who accused Thomas of sexual harassment.\n\nOn ABC\u2019s This Week, Gov. John Kasich, R-Ohio, steered clear of calling Trump a problem for the Republican Party when host George Stephanopoulos asked about him about the GOP frontrunner\u2019s performance.\n\n\"What happened on Thursday is I was relaxed and I was able to talk about my record, balancing the federal budget, one of the chief architects, national security experience\u2014turning Ohio around,\" he said.\n\nKasich\u2019s claim that he was \u201cone of the chief architects\u201d in balancing the federal budget is a talking point we\u2019ve heard several times, including on the debate stage. It rates Mostly True .\n\nKasich, who first won a seat in the House of Representatives in 1982, backed a balanced budget amendment when Republicans were in the minority, and he was a leading voice for the measure when a GOP wave put his party in charge of the House under Newt Gingrich in 1994.\n\nGingrich promoted Kasich over more senior lawmakers and made him chair of the House Budget Committee. Kasich\u2019s big moment came in 1997.\n\nThe nation was poised for a balanced budget. Deficits had been shrinking for years, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Between 1992 and 1996, they fell at an annual average rate of 24 percent each year.\n\nWhen the Clinton administration submitted a budget that would eliminate the deficit by 2004, Kasich was the first Republican to reject and call for a do-over. In a February op-ed, Kasich wrote that \"it is not that difficult to cobble together a budget that could at least appear to be balanced within five years.\" But he said a balanced budget amendment would force leaders to deal honestly with every budget in the future.\n\nNo amendment emerged, but a bipartisan deal was struck by July, and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, sponsored by Kasich, had a clear path. Kasich was at Clinton\u2019s side when the bill was signed into law. House Speaker Newt Gingrich said of Kasich, \"More than any single man, he is responsible for balancing the budget.\"\n\nWhile there is no question that Kasich was a key player in the writing and passage of that law, conservative and independent budget experts pointed to other caveats that also explain why a balanced budget was achievable.\n\nStephen Moore, the libertarian Cato Institute\u2019s director of fiscal policy studies, gave the Republicans great credit for pushing for a balanced budget at the time, though he argued that spending cuts had little to do with the final result, as spending had risen $150 billion in two years. The balanced budget was mostly a result, he wrote, of a strong economy that created new tax revenues and a shrinking military budget.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:54.616+0000"}

He dishes to The Daily Beast about Hillary, Aaron Schock, outing himself, and more.\n\nBarney Frank has a new memoir, Frank: A Life in Politics From the Great Society to Same-Sex Marriage. In the book, which was published this week, he writes about his 40-year career in politics and the societal changes that allowed him to survive and eventually thrive as a gay man.\n\nEleanor Clift interviewed him in Washington this week. He spoke candidly about Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances in the 2016 presidential race, the resignation of Representative Aaron Schock over ethics charges and amid rumors that he is gay, and reflected on the sex scandal that resulted in Congress reprimanding him in 1987, killing his chances of ever becoming the first Jewish Speaker of the House.\n\nQ: In your book, you write about the fear of exposure [as a formerly closeted gay man]. We have a current example with Representative Aaron Schock\u2014there seems to be a lot of vitriol against him in the gay community.\n\nA: Here\u2019s the deal, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gay or not, but I admit I did say if he\u2019s not gay he spends an awful lot of time in the gym. I don\u2019t know a lot of straight guys who go to the gym and parade around with their shirts off. Generally gay men do that to attract other men. There is a principle that I take credit for enunciating a long time ago: There is a right to privacy but not a right to hypocrisy. You have every right to privacy but you do not have a right to go into public office or any other office and enforce rules that are against your own behavior. During Prohibition the media would hide the fact that prohibitioners were drinkers. What I would say to people is, if a leading anti-abortionist had an abortion, you\u2019d write about it. If Sarah Brady owned an Uzi, you\u2019d write about it\u2014especially now. Maybe 40 years ago\u2014coming out, what a terrible thing. But there is no justification now if you\u2019re gay punishing other gay people for what you\u2019re doing. I don\u2019t know if he is, but that\u2019s the basis for the anger.\n\nAll the clues you look for in guessing whether someone is gay\u2014press accounts noted he flew his photographer to India, It\u2019s kind of the modern version of the confirmed bachelor.\n\nHere\u2019s the deal: Your horror is based on the idea that being gay is so horrible, you can\u2019t mention it. Let\u2019s stop treating gay as though we\u2019re accusing him of being a mass murderer.\n\nWhat\u2019s so odd is, he\u2019s a young man\u2014millenials and gen-exers don\u2019t see any big deal about this.\n\nThe only problem he\u2019s got\u2014if he\u2019s gay\u2014is that in the Republican Party you get punished. Even Jim Kolbe, an honorable guy\u2014Jim retired from Congress at 62 well before he would have wanted to because he had a tough primary fight every year. He\u2019s chairman of an appropriations subcommittee and he\u2019s fighting off primaries where they\u2019re getting 40 percent and more against him. Being an openly gay politician in the Republican Party is still very, very difficult.\n\nSchock fancied himself having a significant political career. He talked about becoming Speaker, running for governor.\n\nWhich makes his indulgence all the weirder.\n\nWhy do you think Shock resigned? Is it the ethical issues?\n\nWell, the money is a part of it. It seems like the whole picture made him look odd, ridiculous. It does look like there was some misspending of public money, and it\u2019s true that once you resign, the ethics committee has no further jurisdiction. So it\u2019s either a criminal prosecution or nothing. He\u2019s now avoided any possibility that he will be reprimanded or censured.\n\nThere\u2019s some analogy to your experience\u2014Tip O\u2019Neill thought you would be the first Jewish Speaker of the House, and you worried for many years about the impact on your political career.\n\nWhen I first thought about politics in 1954, being gay was so universally despised, it was something I was going to have to try to repress. As I went forward, I discovered that repression actually worked and I got into a couple jobs, chief assistant to the mayor and then the legislature. I did make this conscious choice: I won\u2019t be honest. I want very much to be in politics. I\u2019ll have to not act on being gay, I would have to keep it quiet. But I will always be an advocate. I may be a coward, but I will always be a supporter. And because nobody else wanted to do it, I wound up being a primary supporter of the gay rights bill, not something I wanted, but I could not walk away from that.\n\nThen things have moved in this country much more rapidly on gay issues than anybody thought, and it became clear that I could come out and have a very good career. I would have been a Harvard Law School graduate who\u2019d had 10 years in the state legislature, which would have made me as a political gay man pretty high up in the experience thing. So I started coming out to Ann and my other siblings, and other people, and then the Pope said Father Drinan couldn\u2019t be a congressman. So I slammed the door on that, because if I came out I never would have been elected to Congress\u2014and reelected. Once in 1983, I think about coming out, and the next thing that happens, Gary Studds gets into trouble with the page. So Gary\u2019s got to defend that. He\u2019s much more honest. Every other gay man who had gotten in trouble who was a congressman denied it or said, I was too drunk to know what I was doing. I always said, you know what, if you\u2019re too drunk to know what you\u2019re doing, you\u2019re not doing anything because you\u2019re too drunk.\n\nSo at that point I had to hold back not to complicate Gary\u2019s life\u2014he got reelected in 1984\u2014so in 1985 I started thinking about it again, and finally I did it in \u201987.\n\nI remember the episode/scandal with your ex-boyfriend\u2014how do you think that would play today if it came out?\n\nThat came two and a half years later, 1989. I had met him in 1985 when I was still closeted\u2014that was a function of my still being closeted. When I came out, I said this is not the kind of life I want. He was furious at me and thought of what he could do\u2014he couldn\u2019t do anything because I had outed myself. My problem was, he made up all this weird stuff about the House gym, which the ethics committee repudiated. The ethics committee found that I lied to a probation officer when I said I met him at a party; I met him through a sex ad\u2014and I let him use my car to avoid parking tickets. I think once people knew it was just prostitution\u2014David Vitter of Louisiana survived it, got reelected despite being involved in a prostitution ring.\n\nBut that was men and women.\n\nI understand that, but today the gay part is not any problem at all. In 2012, the year Jim and I got married, when I was still in Congress, a poll in my district gave me a much higher approval rating for being married than for passing a major bill out of the House Financial Services Committee, which I chaired. So I think the fact that it was same sex today would have no impact.\n\nI was with Newsweek and I did an interview with you where you came out, and they put it on the cover, and you were very angry with me. Why did that upset you so much?\n\nBecause it enhanced the importance of it. It was not world-shaking news. It literally blew it out of proportion.\n\nYour belief in working within the system comes through in your book. And your belief that if you\u2019re having too much fun, you\u2019re not helping.\n\nWe\u2019re fighting to repeal the ban against gays in the military, and a lot of the guys who\u2019ve been kicked out, and they\u2019re lined up behind the stage and some photographer is going to take their picture doing a Rockettes-type kick line. What a terrible way to make our point\u2014that these are soldiers\u2014and to stir up prejudice. It just would have been the wrong image. And then there was the comedienne on stage saying wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have a First Lady to fuck. Can you imagine if Redd Foxx had said that about Jackie Kennedy, what would have happened to him? Many people in the LGBT movement like to say, we\u2019re like the African Americans, but they were much more disciplined and much more strategic. \u2026 Standing up to your enemies brings in campaign contributions; the test of integrity in politics is when you stand up to your friends.\n\nYou\u2019ve taken on your own community while you\u2019ve been advocating. I think some of the readers of this book will be surprised to learn that you you worked on behalf of DADT (Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell).\n\nI wanted a compromise. Les Aspin tried to sell a better compromise that was better than Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell. Colin Powell said, I\u2019ll support it if I can get one other of the Joint Chiefs, and he couldn\u2019t get one, so that did it. I was prepared to take some kind of compromise. The first lawsuits the NAACP Legal Defense Fund brought were not to get rid of segregation, but OK, you say separate but equal, then make it equal. Because they knew that would undermine it.\n\nWhat were the markers along the way that signaled the change in attitudes?\n\nThe big one to me was in 1981 when the District of Columbia repealed its sodomy statute. And at that point either house of Congress could veto a change in the District\u2019s criminal law. The House voted 300 and something to 100 and something to cancel that. Sodomy, private consenting sex, you have to be pretty bigoted to do that. Then there was a series of votes on AIDs-related issues with anti-gay amendments that said basically if you accept any money under this program for research or for care, you must agree that you will not promote homosexuality. We called them the no-promo-homo amendments, and we had to beat those because they would have been terrible, they would have stopped the money from being spent.\n\nAnd those were the first votes we won. This was not some unenforced sodomy statute; this was people\u2019s lives. Because the stakes in the AIDS voting were so high, people gritted their teeth and they voted against anti-gay amendments. That was the first sign that the public was moving.\n\nThe other marker for me was when Tom Kiley and John Marttila did a poll after I came out. It turns out twice as many people thought I would be hurt than were angry themselves, and the people who were angry themselves\u201422 percent\u2014they wouldn\u2019t vote for me no matter what, so I could ignore them.\n\nYou write about how the growing acceptance of the gay community parallels the growing distrust of government. Do they ever intersect, and does one have anything to do with the other?\n\nNo, they really have not. Two groups of white men are left voting Democratic: gays and Jews. God knows what\u2019s going to happen after the Netanyahu thing, what a disaster. On the gay thing, what gays wanted from the government was to be left alone, we wanted the government to enforce that we would not be discriminated against. What white guys want is some active intervention on their behalf economically, which I\u2019m all for, but it\u2019s a different kind of thing.\n\nThat\u2019s why I think Thomas Frank turned out to be wrong. It\u2019s not God, it\u2019s not gays, it is guns a little bit. On abortion, I don\u2019t know anyone who\u2019s been beaten because they\u2019re pro-choice; there is a friction on some environmental issues, like Keystone, but I think it\u2019s fundamentally that white guys\u2014these are the guys who think Franklin Roosevelt was a great guy, Harry Truman was a great guy, Kennedy, Johnson\u2014why? Because they stood up for the working guy and helped us, and since then the liberals aren\u2019t doing anything and we\u2019re getting pounded. They\u2019re too busy with women and gays and blacks.\n\nThat\u2019s the same challenge Clinton had in \u201992.\n\nClinton, and Carter somewhat. Clinton was the first Democratic president and Obama is the second to take office when those negative economic trends were fully set. From 1945 to 1975, America dominated the world. In the \u201970s, with OPEC, that\u2019s when things start to change, when the rest of the world starts to catch up with us. Thomas Piketty\u2019s book about capitalism talks a lot about l\u2019d\u00e9tente glorieaux\u2014the glorious 30 years\u2014it was just beginning to happen under Carter, but by the time Clinton came to power, the position of the white working middle class had eroded. And they\u2019re angry at that. They\u2019re not angry at government because they think government is inherently bad, but they think government could help if they wanted to. Remember the song from our youth\u2014most young people haven\u2019t heard it\u2014\u201cWinchester Cathedral, you\u2019re letting me down. You didn\u2019t do nothing when my baby left town. You could have done something, you didn\u2019t do nothing.\u201d You could have stopped this erosion, and you didn\u2019t do it.\n\nThe middle-class tax cut was Clinton\u2019s big thing. You were at odds with Clinton\u2019s statement that \u201cthe era of big government is over,\u201d but then you were a strong defender during impeachment. What is the impact on trust in government of their return\u2014Hillary\u2019s return\u2014to power\u2014good, bad, indifferent?\n\nIndifferent. It depends on whether or not she can produce results. What we\u2019re really seeing is a reaction to reality. It\u2019s the economy, stupid. Trust in government among the people we\u2019re talking about will come back once they see government helping them go to college and helping with jobs.\n\nDo you have any confidence Hillary Clinton is going to be able to find this formula, or vision?\n\nI\u2019m hopeful. I\u2019m trying to sell it. It begins with a substantial reduction in the military budget. Because if you don\u2019t have the resources, there are things you can do to make people happy, but you need the resources. Legalize drugs and cut the military, and you can expand public construction, and you can provide better child care for working families, and subsidize their health care costs.\n\nIs the core of the trust issue this failure to deliver on substantive issues?\n\nYes, which is why the only way it can be resolved is if we make people happy with what government is doing.\n\nClinton tried to do it with investments in programs; Obama tried to do it with Obamacare.\n\nProblem with Obamacare is this: They were in a situation where there was not enough money to expand health care without finding savings in the system. And the problem both Clinton and Obama faced\u2014and I\u2019m glad you linked them\u2014Clinton raised taxes and put it all into deficit reduction; Obama couldn\u2019t raise taxes at all. They had to expand health care to citizens without it, and the average Joe figured that was coming at his or her expense. That was a problem. If either Clinton or Obama had $50 million to throw into the system, it could have been very popular\u2014we can expand this, and you\u2019re not going to lose anything.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t keep the promise that you can keep your own doctor.\n\nThat made me angry. He never should have said that. They had to know better. That bothered me.\n\nOn the question of Obama and a post-partisan administration\u2014\n\nHe said in his campaign he was going to govern in a post-partisan way, and he kind of used that to criticize the Clintons. He was going to be above the battle. I said it gave me post-partisan depression. I resented the argument that with the Clintons it was kind of a two-way squabble. I was on the House impeachment committee, and I got to ask two great questions when Ken Starr appeared after the congressional election, and he presented his report. Before the election, he said Clinton should be impeached. After the election, he said, Oh, by the way, there was nothing bad in Whitewater or Filegate or the travel office, nothing bad happened in all those. And I said, why\u2019d you wait until after the election to tell us that? He gave us the bad news before, and there was nothing\u2014one oral sex act. Ken Starr\u2019s 11 articles of impeachment were 11 different ways of saying blow job. They were after Clinton; Clinton did not pick that fight. They decided they were going to drive him out of office because they wanted the presidency back.\n\nLooking back at that episode, it looks like the country lost its mind.\n\nTemporarily, but you know what? It got it back. I chronicle that in my book. If you look at the votes\u2014when he had to go on television in August and admit they had oral sex, guys were saying he\u2019s gone\u2014350 to 60\u2014he kept California, Massachusetts, and blacks. Even Gephardt and Bonior voted against him. Then what happened, the country shifted. I remember the day his grand jury testimony was released, I was home and I was checking with my office. The calls were, is that all this is about? The public basically said to the pollsters, you\u2019re going to turn the government over because of consensual sex? I mean, the country shifted, and the Republican Congress was caught in a time warp.\n\nOne other substantive issue: the banks. The left thinks Obama betrayed them; the bankers think he\u2019s one step short of being a socialist. Which is it? You negotiated the legislation, you dealt with the administration directly, where is Obama on this?\n\nPeople who say Obama is much closer to the right don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about. Elizabeth Warren lobbied for the bill. When Russell Feingold said he would vote against the bill because it didn\u2019t go far enough, Elizabeth got very angry and called him up. There is more she would have liked to have gotten done, but it\u2019s a more than significant improvement over where we were. Some people on the left didn\u2019t understand it very well. The left did better on that bill than the bankers.\n\nOne other thing I\u2019ve heard you say about the left hankering for a serious primary challenge to Hillary.\n\nThey want to do to Hillary Clinton what happened to Romney, there\u2019s no point to that.\n\nIn the book, you have nice things to say about a number of Republicans, and people looking for you to dish will be disappointed.\n\nRead the blurbs: Elizabeth Warren, Hank Paulson\u2014when\u2019s the last time you saw the two of them together?\n\nYou\u2019ve gotten good reviews, except Frank Bruni wants you to bare your soul.\n\nHe wants me to bare my genitals.\n\nHe says he wanted to know if you were getting sex.\n\nAnd if I wanted more. The point is whether he was getting sex or not, did he want more? Who doesn\u2019t want more? I was just appalled by that. Bruni is a Republican, and as a gay man he\u2019s conflicted that way. To come out and say I didn\u2019t talk about the sex I was having in a book about politics \u2026\n\nI think you\u2019re pretty candid about the shame you felt.\n\nThe book is called Frank. He thought the title was too short, it should have been 50 Shades of Frank.\n\nI still have my tape recorder on, but I probably shouldn\u2019t use that\u2026\n\nOh, no, I\u2019m looking to get that out \u2026\n\nCorrection: An earlier version claimed Frank supported DOMA when in fact he opposed it in committee and on the floor.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:55.044+0000"}
{"entityId": 1505, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "For the last 30 years, I\u2019ve supported abortion rights. This year may be different.\n\nThe only thing I hate more than talking about abortion is writing about it. It\u2019s no accident that, in 2,000 columns over a quarter-century, I have never\u2014ever\u2014written about abortion. I\u2019ve avoided the topic like a root canal.\n\nBut that is getting harder to do with the release of what are now five gruesome, albeit edited, undercover videos by The Center for Medical Progress depicting doctors and other top officials of Planned Parenthood discussing, and even laughing about, the harvesting of baby organs, as casually as some folks talk about the weather.\n\nIt\u2019s jarring to see doctors acting as negotiators as they dicker over the price of a fetal liver, heart, or brain, and then talk about how they meticulously go to the trouble of not crushing the most valuable body parts. This practice is perfectly legal, and for some people, it is just a business. With millions of abortions each year in America, business is good.\n\n\n\nWho could forget Dr. Mary Gatter, council president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America\u2019s Medical Directors, when, in Video #2, she tells undercover investigators that it isn\u2019t about the money\u2014before she zeroes in on dollars and cents?\n\n\u201cLet me just figure out what others are getting, and if this is in the ballpark, then it\u2019s fine,\u201d Gatter said. \u201cIf it\u2019s still low, then we can bump it up.\u201d\n\nThen, going for broke, she added: \u201cI want a Lamborghini.\u201d\n\nI want a shower.\n\nAs I\u2019ve only realized lately, to be a man, and to declare yourself pro-choice, is to proclaim your neutrality.\n\nMost recently, in Video #5, Melissa Farrell, director of research at Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast in Texas, talks cavalierly about the cost of extracting \u201cintact fetal cadavers.\u201d It is, Farrell says coldly, \u201call just a matter of line items.\u201d\n\n\n\nThis raises the possibility that no one wants to discuss\u2014that some of the aborted fetuses exited the womb alive and they were either killed or left to die, their \u201ccadavers\u201d intact. Also in the latest video, Abby Johnson, the former clinic director of that same Planned Parenthood office, said her branch made about $120,000 a month selling aborted fetus tissue and organs.\n\nAll for the sake of research, no doubt. Make that a long, hot shower with lots of soap.\n\nThe videos were produced by The Center For Medical Progress after a 3-year investigation into Planned Parenthood. While many Democrats\u2014most notably, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest\u2014claim that they haven\u2019t seen the videos so they don\u2019t have to comment, others on the Left admit to having seen them.\n\nHillary Clinton, who recently came to the defense of the organization as doing a lot of good in the field of women\u2019s health, called them \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nDavid Daleiden, head of The Center for Medical Progress, issued an unsurprisingly stronger statement: \u201cPlanned Parenthood\u2019s system-wide conspiracy to evade the law and make money off of aborted fetal tissue is now undeniable. Anyone who watches these videos knows that Planned Parenthood is engaged in barbaric practices and human rights abuses that must end.\u201d\n\nI agree with that assessment, and I\u2019m pro-choice. At least I thought I was until recently. These days, each time, I express concern, outrage, disgust, or horror over another video\u2014which should come with warnings that they may produce nightmares\u2014some supporter of the organization responds by attacking me and insisting that I was never really pro-choice to begin with.\n\nDefenders of Planned Parenthood are trying to deflect criticism away from the organization and onto those who produced the videos. In the minds of true believers, those are the real culprits\u2014guilty of releasing illegally obtained and \u201cheavily edited\u201d videos with the intent of destroying a valuable organization that provides essential health services to millions of women. The organization has hired an expensive Washington, D.C.-based PR firm to do damage control, and the firm quickly tried to pressure television networks to stop airing the videos.\n\nIn California, in a highly unusual preemptive strike, the state Supreme Court and a federal district court have both issued narrowly-crafted temporary restraining orders to stop The Center for Medical Progress from airing more videos before a hearing can be held this month.\n\nAnd in the Senate, a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and transfer the $500 million in federal funds it receives annually to women\u2019s health clinics and other organizations was defeated when it failed to get the 60 votes needed to achieve cloture and move to a vote. Within hours of the defeat, supporters of Planned Parenthood sent out emails urging donors to \u201cstand with\u201d the organization in a craven attempt to use the failed vote to generate even more money in fundraising.\n\nAfter all this, I still consider myself pro-choice, as I have for the last 30 years. I staked out this position during my freshmen year in college. Even then, I understood the abortion debate was a tug-of-war between competing rights\u2014those of the mother versus those of an unborn baby. I sided with the mother. And I tried not to think about the baby.\n\nAll this was happening in the 1980s, which was a particularly tense time in the abortion debate. Americans were at each other\u2019s throats. Protesters picketed the offices of abortion providers. Clinics were bombed or set on fire. Doctors who performed abortions were being threatened. The Moral Majority, Operation Rescue, and the Republican Party seemed an intolerant lot. I couldn\u2019t imagine siding with them, so I lined up on the pro-choice side.\n\nI arrived there for a simple reason: Because I\u2019m a man. Many will say that this is not a very good reason, but it is my reason. Lacking the ability to get pregnant, and thus spared what has been for women friends of mine the anguishing decision of whether to stay pregnant, I\u2019ve remained on the sidelines and deferred to the other half of the population.\n\nOver time, I made refinements\u2014going along with waiting periods and parental notification laws at the state level, and coming out against the barbaric practice known as partial birth abortion.\n\nAs I\u2019ve only realized lately, to be a man, and to declare yourself pro-choice, is to proclaim your neutrality. And, as I\u2019ve only recently been willing to admit, even to myself, that\u2019s another name for \u201cwimping out.\u201d\n\nAt least that\u2019s how my wife sees it. She\u2019s pro-life, and so she\u2019s been tearing into me every time a new video is released. She\u2019s not buying my argument that, as a man, I have to defer to women and trust them to make their own choices about what to do with their bodies. To her, that\u2019s ridiculous\u2014and cowardly.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t stand on the sidelines, especially now that you\u2019ve seen these videos,\u201d she told me recently. \u201cThat\u2019s bullshit! These are babies that are being killed. Millions of them. And you need to use your voice to protect them. That\u2019s what a man does. He protects children\u2014his own children, and other children. That\u2019s what it means to be a man.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t like the scolding, but I needed to hear it. For those of us who are pro-choice, the Planned Parenthood videos are a game changer. As to whether that means I\u2019ll change my view, I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019m on the bubble. Ask me in a few weeks, after the release of more videos.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:55.328+0000"}
{"entityId": 1506, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton is a classic tax-and-spend liberal. So why is his state walloping Scott Walker\u2019s Wisconsin in terms of economic growth?\n\nWisconsin and Minnesota share a common cultural heritage that until recently included a healthy Midwestern strain of progressive politics. Elected in 2010, Governor Scott Walker upended a hundred years of liberal populism, charting a conservative path for Wisconsin that made him a darling of the Republican Right, but left his state with a serious budget shortfall and disappointing job growth.\n\nMeanwhile, across the border in neighboring Minnesota, Governor Mark Dayton has relentlessly pursued liberal policies, embodying the tax-and-spend Democrat that Republicans love to caricature. The result, surprising to many, is that the Minnesota economy is going gangbusters while Wisconsin\u2019s job growth has fallen to 44th among the 50 states.\n\nDayton\u2019s success steering his state\u2019s progressive course has been a surprise. He was a middling senator at best, serving a single term from 2001 to 2007 before returning to Minnesota disillusioned with the way Washington operated. Time named him one of America\u2019s \u201cFive Worst Senators\u201d in 2006, and he was known mainly for his inherited fortune as the great-grandson of the founder of Dayton\u2019s department store, which became Target. As senator, he donated his salary to underwrite bus trips to Canada for senior citizens buying low-cost prescription drugs.\n\n\u201cMinnesota\u2019s gains are not because Mark Dayton has overpowered the state with his political acumen,\u201d says Lawrence Jacobs, a political science professor at the University of Minnesota. He describes the low-key Dayton as the \u201canti-politician,\u201d someone the voters trust because he\u2019s not smooth enough to fool them. \u201cHis skill is he has a clear agenda, and he\u2019s unyielding. This is not pie-in-the-sky Great Society adventurism.\u201d\n\nDayton has a majority Democratic legislature just as Walker has a Republican controlled legislature, bolstering the ongoing policy experiment in their states. The two governors have pursued agendas that mirror their respective party\u2019s core beliefs, and the results so far suggest that the starve-the-government, tax-cutting credo of conservative orthodoxy has run its course.\n\nDayton has raised the minimum wage, and he\u2019s significantly increased taxes on the top 2 percent of wage earners to close a budget shortfall and to raise money for investments in infrastructure and education. In the legislative session that just ended, some Democrats joined with Republicans to block his goal of expanding universal preschool. But he did get more scholarship money to educate 4-year-olds.\n\n\u201cThis is the largest tax increase we\u2019ve seen in Minnesota, over $2 billion,\u201d says Jacobs. More than three-quarters of the new spending is on education, compared to Wisconsin, where education is on the chopping block, and Walker is at odds with professors and administrators alike at his state\u2019s flagship university system.\n\nMinnesota has also passed the state\u2019s version of the Affordable Care Act (MNsure), and while its implementation has been rocky, it is in place and serving tens of thousands of people.\n\nDayton ran for governor in 2010 on an unapologetically liberal agenda, and won narrowly after a recount. He was reelected comfortably in 2014, and his approval rating in the latest Minneapolis Star Tribune poll is 54 percent. Contrast that with Walker\u2019s 41 percent, and you\u2019ve got a clear picture of how each is faring in the eyes of voters.\n\nDayton\u2019s idiosyncratic style is in tune with the times, and at 68, he has no ambition for national office. Walker is running for president and touting hard-right policies that play well with Iowa caucusgoers. He opposed raising the minimum wage, has significantly weakened unions, reduced spending for education, cut taxes on the wealthy, and increased taxes on the middle class in part to pay for the tax cut. According to the nonpartisan Wisconsin Budget Project, Walker gave tax breaks that disproportionally favored upper-income earners while cutting $56 million in tax credits for working families.\n\nFaced with a budget shortfall and no way to plug it without additional revenue, Republicans in the Wisconsin legislature are rebelling against additional spending cuts. But Walker shows no sign of softening his stance against raising taxes or fees. Other Republican governors, notably Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal, are in the same quandary.\n\n\u201cIt seems like they\u2019ve been backed into a corner and are just going forward with pure ideology and discounting any contradictory evidence,\u201d says David Madland, author of Hollowed Out: Why the Economy Doesn\u2019t Work without a Strong Middle Class.\n\nAs the director of the American Worker Project at the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, Madland in his book takes on the premise that inequality is good in the sense that helping the rich get richer is going to help everybody else, that a rising tide lifts all boats. Trickle-down economics has gotten a bad rap and is rarely invoked as a phrase anymore, but the belief that tax cuts are the engine of economic growth remains the core of GOP ideology.\n\nThat Minnesota\u2019s economy rallied under progressive policies while Wisconsin\u2019s has struggled is \u201cone more data point proving that trickle down is wrong,\u201d says Madland. While it\u2019s tricky to attribute the well-being of a state\u2019s economy solely to its political leadership, Minnesota is experiencing much stronger growth than its neighbor. Dayton has also proved responsive to the business community, easing early fears that his liberalism might go unchecked.\n\nWalker, on the other hand, has doubled down to the detriment of his state on policies that are backfiring. And if voters in his home state aren\u2019t buying what he\u2019s selling anymore, that doesn\u2019t bode well for his presidential campaign.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:56.254+0000"}

But he\u2019s also just a regular old manly American man who loves throwing a pigskin as much as the next dude, as one ill-fated child learned on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a stop at the Iowa State Fair Tuesday, the Florida senator lobbed a football towards a flailing blond child and hit him in the head with it.\n\nIn fairness to Rubio, the kid seemed ill-prepared to make the catch. His hands went up at the last second of the route he ran and Rubio\u2019s throw was just slightly out of reach. He is reportedly fine but now undoubtedly viral.\n\nThroughout his political career, Rubio, who is married to a former Miami Dolphins cheerleader, hasn\u2019t kept his love of football a secret from anyone. His YouTube account showcased a video in 2013 in which he is being praised for flying down from Washington, D.C. to coach his sons in youth football games.\n\nRubio also claimed that, unlike President Obama, he\u2019d never keep his sons from playing football. After all, he isn\u2019t too damaged from his own days on the high school gridiron.\n\n\u201cWhen I played and when most people here played tackle football, you actually were taught to hit with your head,\u201d the senator said in a 2013 interview with BuzzFeed. And while he acknowledged the inherent problems with professional football collisions, he wasn\u2019t interested in dealing with it legislatively, as Senator McCain has tried.\n\nBefore he got to the Senate, however, Rubio had a habit of mixing business (politics) and pleasure (football). In 2006 Rubio caught passes from former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino inside the Florida House. \u201cRepresentative Rubio\u2019s fingers are broken,\u201d Florida House Speaker Allan Bense joked at the time.\n\nAnd before catching a cannon of a pass from one of the NFL\u2019s greatest quarterbacks, Rubio kneeled and seemingly \u2018Tebowed\u2019 before the god-fearing quarterback began playing for the University of Florida. Marino was in the House in April 2006 and Tebow only started playing the fall of that year.\n\nBut one famous quarterback inside a legislative building was not enough for the red-blooded American. In 2008, he and Tebow cleared out an aisle to throw passes to each other during one of Rubio\u2019s regular work days.\n\nRubio, who was the Florida Speaker of the House at the time, boggled a catch and blamed Tebow for throwing it too low. On the second attempt, he caught it to the uproarious applause of all the people not doing work in the House.\n\nPresumably Rubio shines the most in his football prowess while playing with major leaguers instead of little kids. And at least the White House lawn is big enough for a pickup game.\n\nThe Rubio campaign has not returned a request for comment about the status of the child or Rubio\u2019s ego.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:56.390+0000"}

Instead, the audience was comprised of men and women in dark suits who darted out of the conference room and into the hallway to murmur in small groups and hiss into bluetooth headsets.\n\nIn other words, this was Bush territory.\n\nAnd he owned it. His reception there couldn\u2019t have been more different than how he was received at CPAC. Back in March, when he spoke at the conservative activist confab, a handful of CPAC attendees marched out of the room behind a man wearing Revolutionary War garb and hoisting a Gadsden flag.\n\n\u201cAnytime you get three standing ovations in a speech, it\u2019s a pretty good sign,\u201d said Will Weatherford, former Florida speaker of the house.\n\nAt Rick Scott\u2019s invite-only event, Bush waltzed onstage to a lengthy standing ovation, complete with whoops, cheers, and whistles\u2014the only candidate to get that kind of greeting. When he wrapped up his speech , the crowd jumped to their feet to give him another standing ovation. And when he finished taking questions from the crowd after that, he got his third standing O of the day.\n\n\u201cAnytime you get three standing ovations in a speech, it\u2019s a pretty good sign,\u201d said Will Weatherford, former Florida speaker of the house. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s a home crowd, but there\u2019s four people from Florida running for president.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, Bush appeared on Cavuto and then got swarmed by a huge mass of reporters\u2014the only candidate at the event to get swamped that way. He fielded questions in English and Spanish. And he seemed comfortable playing hardball on campaign finance. His Right to Rise PAC has drawn significant scrutiny, and some campaign watchdog groups have called on the Justice Department to investigate it for improper coordination.\n\nIn the middle of Monday\u2019s scrum, Bush brushed off a question about that possible lawbreaking.\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a bunch of lawyers advising me along the way.\u201d\n\nAnd he was similarly relaxed when a reporter asked if he felt that he\u2019d been pushed back on his heels over the last few weeks.\n\n\u201cNo, not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cOut there bein\u2019 and doin\u2019, learnin\u2019.\u201d\n\nThen he went to be, do, and learn in a closed-door meeting with old friends.\n\nA constellation of Florida stars\u2014including former speaker of the house Will Weatherford, former Representative Tom Feeney, former U.S. Senator George LeMieux, and CNN contributor Ana Navarro\u2014gathered to chat with the potential candidate and give him a warm reception.\n\nMeeting attendees said there were about 50 people in the room, and that Bush shook hands, posed for photos, gave short remarks, and answered questions as the small crowd sipped on Perrier and munched hard candies.\n\nBillionaire investor and Palm Beach resident Wilbur Ross, who attended, told The Daily Beast afterward that he asked Bush how he would differentiate himself from the other primary candidates.\n\n\u201cHe gave a very good answer: by making sure people understood who he is and what his record was,\u201d Ross said, adding that he\u2019s known Bush for \u201cquite a while.\u201d\n\nAnd Nabil El Sanadi, the president and CEO of Broward Health and a member of the Florida Board of Medicine, said Bush told attendees that he will announce soon that he\u2019s running for president.\n\n\u201cHe just reaffirmed the fact that he hasn\u2019t declared yet but he\u2019s going to declare very soon,\u201d he said.\n\nSanadi said the questions were all friendly, \u201cnothing hostile.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe said he\u2019s going to declare his candidacy in his own time, which would be very soon,\u201d he continued.\n\nAnd Feeney emailed later that Jeb\u2019s team and supporters \u201cwere thrilled with the day in Orlando.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe believes the cornerstone of his campaign victory is largely dependent on American voters getting to know more about him as a person,\u201d Feeney continued. \u201cThose of us that do know him agree that if that happens, he will be our next president.\u201d\n\nJeb\u2019s enormously warm Florida reception is a reminder that no matter how much he\u2019s beat up in the press, he can always count on his friends\u2014billionaires, legislators, and business moguls\u2014to cheer him on.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:56.832+0000"}

Democrats and Republican greeted the news with a big shrug.\n\nIsrael is spying on the U.S.-Iranian nuclear talks? No problem, key Democrats and Republicans in Congress say. It\u2019s just part of the game.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t look at Israel or any nation directly affected by the Iranian program wanting deeply to know what\u2019s going on in the negotiations\u2014I just don\u2019t look at that as spying,\u201d Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, said. \u201cTheir deep existential interest in such a deal, that they would try to figure out anything that they could, that they would have an opinion on it\u2026 I don\u2019t find any of that that controversial.\u201d\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported late Monday evening that Israel spied on U.S. diplomatic negotiations to curtail Iran\u2019s nuclear program. Then the Israelis shared that inside information in an attempt to undermine support for the deal with U.S. lawmakers.\n\nOf course, the White House only found out about this because it too was spying\u2014on Israel.\n\nBut if lawmakers were upset by this turn of events, they weren\u2019t showing it Tuesday. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, for one, joked that he was more concerned that Israeli intelligence hadn\u2019t shared what they learned with him.\n\n\u201cOne of my reactions was, why haven\u2019t they been coming up here sharing information with me? I mean Israel. I haven\u2019t had any of them coming up and talking with me about where the deal is, so I was kind of wondering who it was they were meeting with. I kind of feel left out, if you know what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Corker said.\n\nIf anything, lawmakers said they were perturbed that the Israelis were being accused of spying\u2014not that they did any actual surveillance. Learning the details of the nuclear talk, lawmakers argued, was less like \u201cspying\u201d and more like information gathering.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no non-pejorative way to use the word \u2018spying.\u2019 That is a pejorative accusation. That\u2019s not the phrase I would use to describe what I read\u2026 They care deeply about the negotiation, as they should, they\u2019re getting information about it, and they have an opinion about it,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nSeveral lawmakers interviewed by The Daily Beast said that the Israeli government had not told them anything they weren\u2019t already aware of in broad strokes. Corker said he speaks regularly with foreign ministers and officials from foreign governments, who from time to time pass on relevant information about the nuclear deal discussions.\n\nIf anything, lawmakers said they were perturbed that the Israelis were being accused of spying\n\n\u201cNo one from Israel has told me anything that I haven\u2019t already known,\u201d said Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham. He added: \u201cI hope we\u2019re spying on the Iranians.\u201d\n\nCongressional frustration over the ongoing nuclear talks with Iran reflects a deep concern by many lawmakers that they\u2019ve been cut out of the loop: worries about whether they\u2019re being briefed in sufficient detail, all the way to the extent to which they\u2019ll be given the chance to vote on any future deal.\n\n\u201cIf you think about it, if the White House was doing the normal advise and consent [function] with the Senate, then it wouldn\u2019t be necessary to get our information [elsewhere],\u201d said Corker.\n\nThe day the report was published also happens to be the date of a requested deadline that Congress had set out for a nuclear deal. No deal has yet been reached by the P5+1, the parties negotiating an agreement. But the leaks about the talks\u2014and the surveillance on those talks\u2014continues.\n\nA senior congressional staffer called Obama administration allegations of Israeli spying \u201cdeeply irresponsible innuendo and destructive hearsay,\u201d telling The Daily Beast that \u201cthese unsubstantiated allegations are all the more galling in light of the fact that this Administration has leaked, consistently and aggressively, details of Iran proposals to the front page of The New York Times and other news outlets, as well as to sympathetic think-tankers and pro-Iranian groups outside of government.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:57.067+0000"}

He wore a khaki blazer and his hair was slicked back. In a few minutes, Christie himself would come out, and he would announce, like Giuliano always knew he would, that he is running for president.\n\n\u201cHe was pretty blunt when he was a kid and he\u2019s pretty honest now,\u201d Giuliano remarked in a voice that sounded a lot like Christie\u2019s.\n\nJust outside the gym, their baseball team photo hung on the wall.\n\n\u201cI spoke to him last night,\u201d Giuliano told me. \u201cAnd I said to him, \u2018I remember writing in your yearbook: Maybe one day you will be president. Do you still have it?\u2019\u201d Giuliano laughed. \u201cAnd he said \u2018No, I lost it in the flood!\u2019\u201d\n\nToday, Christie became the 14th Republican to enter the primary. His announcement comes on the heels of a cascade of grim statistics: An in-state approval rating of 30 percent; 44 percent of voters who think he\u2019s full of shit; not even half of the jobs the state lost during the recession recovered; and an unemployment rate of 6.5 percent, considerably higher than the 5.5 percent national average.\n\nAll of that, and the Bridgegate investigation may not yet be over.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s miraculous, then, that Christie has managed to garner the support of 4 percent of likely Republican primary voters\u2014a number which places him behind Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Rand Paul, and Donald Trump.\n\nIf any of this worries him, though, he didn\u2019t show it during his performance.\n\nChristie walked onstage to \u201cWho Says You Can\u2019t Go Home,\u201d by Bon Jovi, who incidentally performed at a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton on Monday night in Red Bank, a riverfront town an hour south.\n\n\u201cYou get what I think, whether you like it or not or whether it makes you cringe every once in a while.\u201d\n\nChristie\u2019s campaign staffers said they were expecting 1,000 people to flood into the gymnasium, which is why, they claimed, the fire department made them remove the chairs that had been set up for the press. The room was at capacity by the time Christie got to the stage, but with what looked like just a few hundred supporters.\n\nThe first half of his speech was a slow, painstakingly detailed account of his family\u2019s history. The second half, a fast-paced glossing over of his record in New Jersey, a series of uneasy snipes at President Obama, odd metaphors and plenty of platitudes about Leadership and Working Together.\n\nAhead of the speech, Christie\u2019s team advertised the fact that unlike President Obama, he would not be using a Teleprompter to help him deliver his remarks, which might explain it.\n\n\u201cWe need strength and decision-making and authority back in the Oval Office,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that is why, today, I am proud to announce my candidacy for the Republican nomination for President of the United States of America!

The horse is out of the barn, and you can only get it back in by force.\u201d\n\nChristie, whose extent of foreign policy experience includes a trip to Mexico, a trip to England, and the declaration that Vladimir Putin would respect him more than he does Obama, bemoaned \u201cseven years of weak and feckless foreign policy run by Barack Obama.\u201d\n\nHe cautioned that the American people \u201cbetter not turn it over to his second mate, Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nAs Christie took credit for making New Jersey the better place that it almost certainly isn\u2019t, he promised \u201ca campaign without spin and without pandering or focus group tested answers.

{"entityId": 1511, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In the 1960s, Gore Vidal and William F. Buckley were having the same political arguments we\u2019re having today\u2014and had a lot more fun making them.\n\nIn Hillary Clinton\u2019s first economic policy speech this past week in New York, she tracked the income gap between the super-rich and middle class back 15 years. It\u2019s been going on way longer than that.\n\nI recently saw a preview of a fascinating documentary, Best of Enemies, about the 1968 political debates between the two original ideologues of our polarized cultural wars. William F. Buckley, a staunch Catholic, was then the leading light of the conservative movement. Gore Vidal, a cousin of Jackie Kennedy, was a brilliant novelist, playwright, and a scathing left-wing satirist. Way back then, Vidal raised the issue of \u201cincome disparity.\u201d He pointed to a statistic that was shocking fifty years ago. \u201cFive percent of Americans own twenty percent of the nation\u2019s wealth.\u201d\n\nThose were the good old days.\n\nToday, it\u2019s the top one percent of Americans who hold 22 percent of the nation\u2019s wealth. CNBC makes an even more startling prediction: By 2016, the combined wealth of the world\u2019s richest one percent could overtake that of the other 99 percent.\n\nWhen ABC-TV pitted the two patrician public intellectuals against each other in ten debates aired during the Republican and Democratic national conventions, audiences of 10 to 12 million couldn\u2019t get enough of Buckley and Vidal. TV news was never again the same bland comfort food swallowed by all Americans.\n\nWhat astonishes about the film, which opens at the end of this month, is how utterly recognizable are the opposite poles of American identity represented by these two men. This is where our culture wars began, and watching Vidal and Buckley do battle across so many fronts reminds us that culture and economics are in fact inextricably linked.. Where, oh where, are intellects like these today \u2013 courageous women and men who could strip the lying flesh off the financial manipulators, the climate deniers and the unrepentant bigots and birthers?\n\nBest of Enemies took producer-directors Morgan Neville and Robert Gordon five years to make, because investors couldn\u2019t believe that political debates held fifty years ago would be relevant to audiences of today. Wrong.\n\nIn language that was anything but politically correct, the rivals got down to the visceral level of what was bugging the public. The opposing political poles given voice by Buckley and Vidal excited the public, in much the same way that the unapologetic socialist Bernie Sanders and the raging egomaniac Trump do today.\n\nBuckley, with his intimidating lizard tongue flick, dismissed the poor as \u201cfreeloaders.\u201d Then he would pop a disarming smile like cubes from an ice tray to extol the virtues of free market capitalism. His wit made him mesmerizing to watch in well-chosen archival clips. Lowering himself to appear on \u201cLaugh In,\u201d he was rudely confronted by an audience member: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you ever stand up? Can\u2019t you think on your feet?\u201d\n\nBuckley gave his sideways sardonic smile. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to stand up when you carry the weight of knowing so much.\u201d\n\nVidal, fleshy-lipped and sloe-eyed, came to the first debates prepared with pages of razor-sharp digs, but he led into them with seductive words that often caught his opponent off guard.\n\nWhat astonishes about the film, which opens at the end of this month, is how utterly recognizable are the opposite poles of American identity represented by these two men\n\nBy their tenth match in these heavyweight bouts of brainy blood sport, Vidal is calling Buckley a \u201ccrypto-Nazi.\u201d An enraged Buckley, who\u2019d fought in World War II, bares his pointy teeth to call Vidal a \u201cqueer\u201d \u2013 surfacing sexual orientation as a slur for the first time on national TV. Vidal had recently published a scandalous novel, \u201cMyra Breckenridge\u201d, which depicted the first transgender heroine. Buckley wound up warning the nonplussed Vidal: \u201cI\u2019ll sock you in the face and you\u2019ll stay plastered.\u201d\n\nBeyond Vidal\u2019s prescient mention of income disparity, he and his rival were not concerned with class warfare. Both were rich white men in a social stratum where wives or gay partners usually stayed home and planned dinner parties and hired nannies. Today, almost two-thirds of mothers with children under six are in the work force. But we\u2019re still arguing about all the \u201cculture war\u201d issues that broke out in the early 90s when the Clintons first ran as co-presidents and Conservative commentator Pat Buchanan used them as targets.\n\nThe polarization that has transformed American politics was dubbed the \u201cculture wars\u201d in 1991. A year later, Buchanan stunned the Republican National Convention with a speech claiming that the country was in a \u201creligious war for the soul of America.\u201d He would name abortion, sexual orientation, radical feminism, gun politics, and even clashes over the Confederate flag as \u201chot-button issues.\u201d\n\nAnd here we are, 35 years later, with a wider chasm than ever between \u201cprogressives\u201d and \u201cconservatives.\u201d Class warfare linked with the culture wars pit presidential candidates like Senator Ted Cruz \u2013who wants to abolish the IRS and let citizens fill out their taxes on a post card\u2014against Senator Bernie Sanders, who could easily comply, never having held a fulltime job before he entered politics at 40 and whose estimated net worth is $330,000.\n\n\u201cBill [Buckley] wouldn\u2019t have liked the Tea Party at all,\u201d says Neville. Buckley\u2019s greatest achievement was to cleanse the right from the John Birch Society and make it respectable, founding the National Review as its mouthpiece. \u201cThe swing of the pendulum [to the extreme right] began after 1980.\u201d\n\nIn 2015, Hillary Clinton is way ahead of Republicans in recognizing the impact of our fast-spreading \u201cgig economy.\u201d Companies are continuing to cut full time jobs with benefits, and replacing them with freelancers and contract workers paid for piece work with no benefits. That\u2019s both positive and negative. It means lots more innovation in our economy by well-educated self-starters who make up today\u2019s growing entrepreneurial class.\n\nBut the \u201cEnd of Work,\u201d as The Atlantic has called it, also means the marginalization of many middle-class white and blue collar workers. Clinton sees that the economic mission of our times is to raise incomes for the vast majority of Americans so they can afford a middle-class life.\n\nHere\u2019s a stunning prediction by AARP\u2019s chief brand officer, Emilio Pardo: By 2020, more than 40 percent of Americans will be working as freelancers or entrepreneurs\u2014not as paid full-time workers with benefits.\n\nClinton fingered by name a few of the \u201ctrickle down\u201d troglodytes\u2014Jeb Bush, Scott Walker and Marco Rubio\u2014who are still pushing policies from the old Reagan and George W Bush regimes that sank our country in national debt. As Hillary said, \u201cTwice now in the past 20 years, a Democratic president [Clinton and Obama] has had to come in and clean up the mess left behind\u201d from the Republican habit of cutting taxes for the rich and letting big corporations write their own rules.\n\nCorporate profits are soaring as paychecks continue to shrink. Clinton\u2019s solution is a new \u201cFairness Economy,\u201d starting with a resurgent movement of women into the American workforce. Over the past 40 years, she points out, working women pumped $3.5 trillion of growth into our economy. The U.S. used to rank 7th out of 24 countries in women\u2019s labor force participation. By 2013, we had sunk to 19th place. That engine of growth is seriously stalled.\n\nClinton promises to fight for fair pay and fair scheduling, paid family leave and earned sick days. On top of that, she calls on companies to offer higher wages and better benefits, and to share profits with their employees. This is a new front in the culture wars.\n\nSo as long as we keep escalating this eternal \u201cwar for the soul of America\u201d (and for the billionaire backers who will pony up the most undisclosed bucks), can\u2019t we find a pair of bitchy brainiacs who will make us laugh all the way to the unemployment lines?\n\nGail Sheehy is the author of \u201cDARING: My Passages\u201d and \u201cHillary\u2019s Choice\u201d.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:57.611+0000"}

That unofficial status allowed him to actively lobby for six- and seven-figure contributions on behalf of the Right to Rise super PAC, something not legally permitted since he became an official candidate in June.\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to tell from public filings whether Bush personally solicited former colleagues or the companies where he served on boards. Right to Rise officials could not be reached for comment. Allie Brandenburger, a spokesperson for Bush, emailed a statement: \u201cGov. Bush has taken a conservative approach to all of his political activities. Throughout this process he has complied with all applicable campaign-finance laws and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, the money is only a fraction of the roughly $114 million raised by the network of entities supporting Bush\u2019s campaign. But executives associated with those companies have also hosted fundraisers and solicited others, suggesting they could be responsible for millions more.\n\nA big chunk of the $1.7 million\u2014more than a third\u2014came from contributors connected to British bank Barclays, where Bush was an adviser until 2014.\n\nFor instance, Stephen Lessing, who worked with Bush at Lehman Brothers and Barclays, where Lessing is now a managing director, contributed about $277,000 to Right to Rise, mostly in January, and gave $2,700, the maximum primary contribution, to Bush\u2019s campaign after he formally declared his candidacy.\n\nIn addition, Lessing is a member of the Right to Rise executive committee, which means he has either contributed or raised $1 million, and he has been listed as a host for at least one Hamptons fundraiser benefitting the campaign.\n\nBob Diamond, a former CEO of Barclays PLC, contributed $100,000 to Right to Rise in March. Barclays\u2019s Martin Shafiroff gave $25,000 and co-hosted a breakfast fundraiser in the Hamptons.\n\nOther companies and executives pitched in, too.\n\nSeth Bernstein is the founder of Empower Software. Bush was a member of the company\u2019s board of directors until he stepped down in December 2014, according to his financial disclosure form. Bernstein donated $75,000 to Right to Rise, and has also been listed as a campaign fundraiser host.\n\nRichard Jackson, the chairman and CEO of Jackson Healthcare, and Shane Jackson, its president, together gave $550,000 to Right to Rise. Bush was a member of the company\u2019s board of advisers, according to his financial disclosure form. Jackson Healthcare executives also donated to the campaign.\n\nContributors listing Tenet Healthcare, another company where Bush sat on the board, gave $33,000 to the campaign and $127,500 to Right to Rise, including $100,000 from Tenet CEO Trevor Fetter in March.\n\nDonn Walker, director of external communications for Tenet Healthcare, said there is no organized effort at the company to support any presidential candidate, including Bush, and the company doesn\u2019t comment on \u201cour employees\u2019 individual, personal political activities.\u201d\n\nBush was also on the board of Rayonier Inc., a publicly traded timber company that gave $50,000 to Right to Rise. Michael Bell, the director of public affairs for Rayonier, said Bush did not personally request the donation, but the company\u2019s senior management discussed it and \u201cwe support the Right to Rise mission.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not really a secret that we hold Gov. Bush in very high regard,\u201d he said.\n\nBell said he wasn\u2019t sure if the contribution was Rayonier\u2019s first to a super PAC, though he described such direct corporate donations to political committees as \u201crare.\u201d\n\nA search of FEC records did not turn up additional super PAC contributions from Rayonier. Asked if the company would make additional contributions to Right to Rise or other super PACs, Bell said he didn\u2019t yet know.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s something that we would talk about and consider,\u201d he said. \u201cAt its heart, Rayonier and most corporations don\u2019t believe they can improve public policy by disengaging from the process.\u201d\n\nSince 2007, when the former Florida governor left office, Bush served on the board of directors or advisory boards of at least 15 companies or nonprofits, an Associated Press review found this year.\n\nBush this year filed a complex, 40-page financial-disclosure form disclosing his previous corporate board positions, as well as positions with nonprofits, companies he owned, and investments made via limited liability companies or private equity funds.\n\nBush\u2019s less-direct private sector contacts yielded contributions, too\u2014some of them sizable.\n\nFor instance, investor William Oberndorf, who sits on the board of Foundation for Excellence in Education, which Bush founded in 2008, gave $1.5 million to Right to Rise.\n\nBradford Freeman, an investment banker with Freeman Spogli & Co., which paid Bush $45,000 to give a speech in May 2014, according his personal financial disclosure report, gave $1 million.\n\nThis piece comes from the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan, nonprofit investigative news organization.

(The 49-year-old actor was reacting to a recent Daily Beast interview with Owen Wilson, in which Wilson essentially dubbed Trump the Charlie Sheen of politics.) \u201cIf Trump will [have] me I\u2019d be his VP in a heartbeat!\u201d Sheen tweeted, with the hashtag \u201c#TrumpSheen16.\u201d\n\nAs Mediaite notes, it wasn\u2019t too long ago that Sheen was calling Trump \u201ca sad & silly homunculus,\u201d whose \u201cwords [are] as poignant as a sack of cat farts.\u201d\n\nBut let\u2019s entertain this Sheen-vice-presidency notion for a quick second. OK? Charlie Sheen has been repeatedly accused of violence against women. He jumped on the anti-vaccine celebrity bandwagon. And he, like Trump, has in the past expressed support for some liberal positions, including stricter gun laws.\n\nSheen is also one of America\u2019s most prominent 9/11 conspiracy theorists. He has been very upfront about this, and has no problem floating theories that George W. Bush facilitated 9/11.\n\nSheen isn\u2019t the only famous 9/11 truther who seems to be drawn to what Trump 2016 is selling. Conspiracy-uber-monger Alex Jones admitted that he agrees with roughly \u201c95% of what Donald Trump says.\u201d Earlier this month, former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura declared the real-estate mogul the best pick for the GOP.\n\n\u201cIf Donald Trump were to ask me to be his running mate, I would give it very serious consideration because anything to break up the status quo of this country,\u201d Ventura told CBS\u2019s Minneapolis affiliate. \u201cThis country needs to be shaken up. It needs to be shaken to its very core, and Donald Trump is doing that.\u201d (The two are longtime friends, and Trump appeared at a Ventura campaign event in Minneapolis in January 2000.)\n\nVentura is passionate about many political issues, such as prosecuting Bush administration officials for torturing detainees, but his signature issue is investigating who REALLY carried out the 9/11 attacks.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sheen\u2019s generous offer. (Sheen\u2019s rep hasn\u2019t gotten back to us, either, regarding his seriousness.) At the very least, Trump used to speak highly of Sheen, telling David Letterman in 2011 that the actor was \u201ca wonderful guy, I really like him a lot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little bit impressed with him,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d\n\nNot the most resounding of endorsements, but far from a panning of his potential truther running mate.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:58.438+0000"}
{"entityId": 1514, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Illiberal feminists have decided the best way to win is by demonizing and silencing opponents, rather than making a better argument.\n\nWhen men disagree with illiberal feminists, a favored silencing tactic is to accuse them of \u201cmansplaining.\u201d The term grew out of a fairly brilliant 2008 essay by feminist writer Rebecca Solnit, who described the exquisitely annoying feeling of having a certain type of man condescendingly lecture a woman on a topic about which he knows very little\u2014in this case Solnit\u2019s own book. This is certainly a phenomenon I and millions of other women have experienced, and it can be maddening. But the illiberal feminists have forged the notion of \u201cmansplaining\u201d into a weapon to silence any man who expresses an opinion at odds with feminist orthodoxy.\n\nHow it works is relatively simple. A pro-life man who talks about abortion with a pro-choice woman is \u201cmansplaining.\u201d (But a \u201cpro-choice\u201d man agreeing with a pro-choice woman is not.) The Atlantic accused Texas Governor Rick Perry of \u201cclassic mansplaining\u201d after he criticized Wendy Davis\u2019s thirteen-hour filibuster to prevent a vote on a bill that would have placed restrictions on abortion. His offending comment? He noted, \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that she hasn\u2019t learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters.\u201d Perry was referencing the fact that Davis had experienced an unplanned pregnancy while a teenager, which resulted in the birth of her first daughter.\n\nMarin Cogan at GQ accused Mitt Romney of trying to \u201cmansplain [his] way to the White House\u201d during his 2012 presidential run. The examples she raised\u2014his complaints about bureaucratic red tape or criticism about how security was being handled at the London Olympics\u2014were standard political fare recast as \u201cmansplaining.\u201d New York magazine accused Republican Senator Ted Cruz of \u201cmansplaining\u201d to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein when he made a conservative point about the Second Amendment during a hearing. Salon.com accused Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin of \u201cmansplaining\u201d to incoming Democratic Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin when he told a local paper, \u201cHopefully I can sit down and lay out for her my best understanding of the federal budget because they\u2019re simply the facts,\u201d he told the Chippewa Herald. \u201cHopefully she\u2019ll agree with what the facts are and work toward common sense solutions.\u201d\n\nIlliberal feminists turn simple ideological disagreements, whether about the federal budget or the Second Amendment or anything else, into excuses to engage in character assassination, dismissing their opponents as sexists. Conservatives are their favorite targets, but any dissident can land in their crosshairs.\n\nvia Amazon\n\nIn their ideological zeal, the feminists of the illiberal left don\u2019t seem to realize how they\u2019ve given feminism a bad name. According to a 2013 Huffington Post/YouGov poll only 23 percent of American women said they would identify as a \u201cfeminist,\u201d despite the fact that majorities of male and female respondents said \u201cmen and women should be social, political, and economic equals.\u201d29 Even among Democrats, the \u201cfeminist\u201d label is in low repute: only 32 percent applied the term to themselves.\n\nStill, illiberal feminists wield a perverse power among academics and media pundits who take for granted the feminists\u2019 outrageous claim that female dissidents from the illiberal left aren\u2019t actually women.\n\nFeminist writer Naomi Wolf once described the foreign-policy analysis of Jeane Kirkpatrick as being \u201cuninflected by the experiences of the female body.\u201d Feminist icon Gloria Steinem called former U.S. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison a \u201cfemale impersonator.\u201d Patricia Ireland, former president of the National Organization for Women, once instructed Democrats to vote only for \u201cauthentic\u201d (translation: pro\u2013abortion rights) female political candidates. During the 2010 midterm election season, Democratic Congresswoman Janis Baird Sontany of Tennessee said of her GOP colleagues, \u201cYou have to lift their skirts to find out if they are women. You sure can\u2019t find out by how they vote.\u201d In August 2010, liberal talk show host Stephanie Miller laughed uproariously when a female guest on her show said that if she ever met conservative columnist Michelle Malkin, \u201cI would kick [her] right in the nuts,\u201d and warned, \u201cWear a cup, lady.\u201d Ann Coulter is routinely referred to as \u201cMann Coulter\u201d on liberal blogs.\n\nDehumanizing slurs have routinely been used against Sarah Palin. In 2011, Gloria Steinem snarked that, \u201cSarah Palin and Michele Bachmann . . . are on my list of \u2018the women only a man could love.\u2019\u201d Her comment echoed the illiberal feminist attacks during the 2008 election, when Palin was derided by the Huffington Post as \u201cBush in lipstick.\u201d Wendy Doniger blogged at the Washington Post that Palin\u2019s \u201cgreatest hypocrisy is in her pretense that she is a woman.\u201d36 Cintra Wilson wrote during the tsunami of anti-Palin hysteria in 2008, \u201cSarah Palin may be a lady, but she ain\u2019t no woman.\u201d Get it? \u201cReal women\u201d are pro-abortion Democrats. And conservative women? Well, while reigning as the uber-liberal at Current TV, Keith Olbermann said on his show that conservative columnist S. E. Cupp should herself have been aborted.\n\nIn 2012, when I criticized liberal men for their sexist attacks against conservative women in a Daily Beast column, Keith Olbermann went nuts. He proclaimed on his show that people should ignore me because I was a \u201chouse tamed liberal at Fox News,\u201d comparing me to slaves forced to conform to the will of their masters. He took to Twitter to continue his attacks, and his followers jumped in, saying I was a \u201cwind-up toy,\u201d a \u201cbobblehead,\u201d and \u201cjust another brainless plastic doll Fox puts on camera to appease the horned up 60-year-old white dudes at home.\u201d Olbermann never tried to refute anything I wrote; in fact, by his behavior he only added to my column\u2019s many examples of liberal men making vicious sexist statements.\n\nCharacter assassination was the method of discourse favored by Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy; and it was a tenet of the liberal creed to resist such tactics. But Olbermann and his ilk are happy to use delegitimizing and demonizing tactics in an effort to further their ideological causes.\n\nIlliberal feminists turn simple ideological disagreements into excuses to engage in character assassination, dismissing their opponents as sexists.\n\nStrangely, while illiberal feminists treat conservative women as men in drag, men who identify as women are treated as women. At Mount Holyoke College in 2015, a student theatre group canceled its scheduled performance of The Vagina Monologues because it was too \u201creductionist and exclusive.\u201d Who did this feminist masterpiece exclude? According to an e-mail sent to explain the decision, \u201cAt its core, the show offers an extremely narrow perspective on what it means to be a woman. . . . Gender is a wide and varied experience, one that cannot simply be reduced to biological or anatomical distinctions.\u201d The play\u2019s author, Eve Ensler, defended her work, saying in an interview that it wasn\u2019t meant to speak for all women and that \u201cWomen with and without vaginas need a voice.\u201d\n\nWhen illiberal feminists aren\u2019t delegitimizing female dissenters from their worldview as fake women, they are portraying them in such a hyper-sexualized way that they are reduced to nonhuman objects. Avoiding classic sexist stereotypes would seem to be the minimum expected of avowed feminists. Psychology Today42 reported in 2010 on multiple studies that found that \u201cfocusing on a woman\u2019s appearance (fully dressed) is enough for . . . men and women . . . to dehumanize a woman. . . . [P]eople assign female targets less \u2018human nature traits\u2019 when focus is on their appearance.\u201d The human traits that these men and women were seen as lacking include the ability to think, express emotions, or even feel pain.43 They noted that a key study on the issue found that when \u201cwomen were dressed sexually. . . . people implicitly associated them more with animals.\u201d\n\nIlliberal feminists don\u2019t need Psychology Today to tell them that treating women as sex objects is dehumanizing. Feminist scholars have been arguing this for decades.\n\nYet, in her 2011 Elle piece titled \u201cThe Best and the Rightest,\u201d writer Nina Burleigh described conservative women who were on the rise as, \u201cright-wing girl Millennials\u201d who were following \u201cin the high heels of the former governor of Alaska.\u201d One woman, she wrote, moved \u201cfrom chair to podium with the lithe, twitchy ease of a big cat, hazel-eyed and trailing a honey-colored mane, all 20 tawny years of her packed into a skintight electric blue stretch-satin cocktail dress.\u201d Another woman was described as, \u201cA curvaceous, dark-haired 25-year-old . . . [with] a diamond-studded cross dangling above very visible cleavage.\u201d\n\nWhen Senator Joni Ernst\u2014a GOP rising star\u2014delivered the State of the Union response in January 2015, MSNBC host Ronan Farrow tweeted, \u201cJoni Ernst delivering response in the style of an in-flight safety video.\u201d And again, pretending to quote her: \u201c\u2018We\u2019ll also cut wasteful spending and balance the budget\u2019 [pantomimes latching shut safety belt].\u201d This attempt to dismiss her as a serious person echoed comments made by then-Senator Tom Harkin who was campaigning for Ernst\u2019s opponent in her 2014 race to fill Harkin\u2019s seat. \u201cIn this Senate race, I\u2019ve been watching some of these ads,\u201d Harkin said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s sort of this sense that, \u2018Well, I hear so much about Joni Ernst. She is really attractive, and she sounds nice.\u2019 . . . Well, I got to thinking about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if she\u2019s as good looking as Taylor Swift or as nice as Mr. Rogers, but if she votes like [Minnesota Congresswoman] Michele Bachmann, she\u2019s wrong for the state of Iowa.\u201d Pretty Republican women are apparently interchangeable, but it\u2019s worth noting that Joni Ernst is, among other things, a lieutenant colonel in the Iowa National Guard, a veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and had served in the Iowa State Senate. She is, in other words, more than just a pretty face, and certainly entitled to political opinions that differ from Tom Harkin\u2019s.\n\nIn a 2008 Salon.com piece, Cintra Wilson referred to Sarah Palin as a \u201cChristian Stepford wife in a \u2018sexy librarian\u2019 costume\u201d and the GOP\u2019s \u201chardcore pornographic centerfold spread.\u201d Daily Kos, a leading liberal blog, ran a mock Playboy cover featuring the forty-four-year-old then-governor of Alaska. The Huffington Post ran a photo montage of Palin\u2014 only the second woman to join a presidential ticket\u2014headlined \u201cFormer Beauty Queen, Future VP?\u201d MSNBC ran a November 2009 segment showing photo-shopped pictures of Palin wearing an American flag bikini and holding a rifle; and one of her wearing a tight black miniskirt. When they flashed on the screen, the host noted, \u201cShe\u2019s hot.\u201d MSNBC apologized later for not alerting viewers that the pictures were photo-shopped, but offered no apology for the sexist segment.\n\nIn a Salon.com column headlined \u201cForget the tea party\u2014what about the crumpets?\u201d Gene Lyons wrote that, \u201cThe most entertaining aspect of the 2010 election season has been the rise of the right-wing cuties\u2014 political celebrities whose main qualification is looking terrific on television. From where I sit, in a comfortable chair in front of the tube, the GOP Cupcake Factor has enlivened an otherwise dreary campaign season.\u201d Liberal British comedian Russell Brand explained that the only reason Sarah Palin has any appeal is, \u201cPeople want to f-ck her.\u201d During the 2008 campaign, Paul Hackett, a high-profile but unsuccessful former Democratic congressional candidate in Ohio, suggested that Democrats run against the McCain/Palin ticket by pointing out that Palin \u201caccidentally got pregnant at age 43 and the tax payers of Alaska have to pay for the care of her disabled child.\u201d \u201cWar on Women,\u201d anyone? And so much for being \u201cpro-choice.\u201d\n\nIn April 2014 actress Kirsten Dunst, who describes herself as a feminist, told the UK edition of Harper\u2019s Bazaar, \u201cI feel like the feminine has been a little undervalued.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have to get our own jobs and make our own money, but staying at home, nurturing, being the mother, cooking\u2014it\u2019s a valuable thing my mom created,\u201d she added. She also praised men: \u201cSometimes, you need your knight in shining armor,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. You need a man to be a man and a woman to be a woman. That\u2019s why relationships work.\u201d\n\nThe illiberal feminists were enraged. Jezebel ran a story saying that Dunst, an \u201cactress and blonde who looks good in clothes,\u201d is \u201cnot paid to write gender theory so it shouldn\u2019t surprise anyone that she\u2019s kind of dumb about it.\u201d On Twitter, a few illiberal feminists wrote that, \u201cShe should just keep quiet. I wasn\u2019t aware Kirsten Dunst could be more unlikable\u201d and suggested Dunst be added to \u201cthe list of famous women who should never be allowed to talk near young girls. Ever.\u201d Since Dunst didn\u2019t say the right thing, she was labeled a sex object with no brains and essentially told to keep her pretty little mouth shut.\n\nIn her Elle hit piece on young conservative women, Nina Burleigh added insult to infantilizing. Not content with labeling the half dozen conservative women as \u201cgirls,\u201d she dubbed them \u201cBaby Palins.\u201d Karin Agness, one of the women featured in the article, pointed out in a piece for National Review that \u201cRather than try to understand how some women could be conservative and the arguments we have against feminism, it is often much easier to explain us all away as \u2018Baby Palins.\u2019 The Palin brand has been so damaged by the media that the \u2018Baby Palin\u2019 label serves the purpose of quickly stereotyping and delegitimizing us at the same time.\u201d\n\nIn May 2010, Palin rocked the feminist establishment when she asserted in a speech to the Susan B. Anthony List that there is an \u201cemerging, conservative, feminist identity.\u201d She dubbed this \u201cWestern Feminism.\u201d Illiberal feminists circled the wagons to begin the process of delegitimizing her. Gloria Steinem declared to Katie Couric that Palin was not a feminist because \u201cyou can\u2019t be a feminist who says that other women can\u2019t [have an abortion] and criminalizes abortion.\u201d\n\nNever mind that many of the Suffragettes, the first American feminists, were anti-abortion, or that feminism is supposed to be about women making \u201cchoices\u201d which should include the choice to decide their own beliefs. Feminist writer Amanda Marcotte asserted: \u201cYou look at someone like Sarah Palin trying to wear . . . [the feminist] mantle, and you see the flaw in trying to be a so-called conservative feminist, which is that you\u2019re not very pro-women.\u201d Jessica Valenti, founder of Feministing, blasted \u201cthe fake feminism of Sarah Palin\u201d in the Washington Post, and argued, \u201cGiven that so-called conservative feminists don\u2019t support women\u2019s rights, how can they paint their movement as pro-woman? Why are they not being laughed out of the room?\u201d\n\nThe demonizing continued unabated. Steinem told New York magazine that conservative women leaders like Bachmann and Palin are \u201cthere to oppose the women\u2019s movement. That\u2019s their job. . . . it\u2019s inevitable. . . . there have always been women like this.\u201d Note the distinction Steinem is making with \u201cwomen like this.\u201d Conservative women don\u2019t just have differing opinions, they are double agents pretending to care about women while their real plan is to destroy women\u2019s rights. This echoed something Steinem said to me when I told her I was writing a profile of Bachmann for Elle magazine: \u201cWho are the people who are putting these women\u2014Palin and Bachmann\u2014up to running?\u201d Steinem asked. Then she answered her question: \u201cIt\u2019s men who want them to run.\u201d\n\nThere really is no winning with the illiberal feminists. They become enraged when the \u201cwrong\u201d people call themselves feminist, but then turn contemptuous when a woman says she isn\u2019t. In Nina Burleigh\u2019s Elle profile of conservative women, she blasted her subjects for saying they were not feminists. She wrote, \u201cBehold the new face of conservative womanhood. Young women [who] are the unintended, some might say ungrateful, daughters of feminism. . . .\u201d Perplexed as to why these under-thirty-five women \u201cwho pride themselves on being totally modern\u201d might not identify with a movement that treats conservative women like garbage, she landed on a theory. It was \u201cpolitics and ambition\u201d that drove them to say they weren\u2019t feminists because, \u201cFeminist bashing remains the surest way to earn cred in the conservative movement, and \u2018feminist\u2019 is an easy, all-purpose insult. . . .\u201d\n\nWhen actress Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting (Penny on the Big Bang Theory) told Redbook magazine that she didn\u2019t consider herself a feminist, the illiberal left turned on her, calling her a \u201ctalentless bitch\u201d and telling her \u201cBeing a feminist is about wanting equality. If you don\u2019t believe in equality, you\u2019re a shit human.\u201d It became such a controversy that the actress prostrated herself before the illiberal mob, which was duly reported in the Associated Press under the headline, \u201cKaley Cuoco-Sweeting apologizes for comments on feminism.\u201d\n\nFor Ann Romney it was a Mother\u2019s Day 2012 op-ed for USA Today that celebrated motherhood. She closed her piece with this: \u201cWomen wear many hats in their lives. Daughter, sister, student, breadwinner. But no matter where we are or what we\u2019re doing, one hat that moms never take off is the crown of motherhood. There is no crown more glorious.\u201d Dissing the column on MSNBC, Newsweek/Daily Beast columnist Michelle Goldberg called Romney \u201cinsufferable\u201d as other \u201cpro-women\u201d panelists giggled as she said the phrase \u201ccrown of motherhood\u201d reminded her of Hitler and Stalin. This saccharine op-ed written for Mother\u2019s Day was, claimed Goldberg, just like when authoritarian societies gave awards to women who had big families. In a column responding to people upset with her comparison of Ann Romney to two of the worst mass murderers in history, Goldberg doubled down on the demonization, writing, \u201cbombastic odes to traditional maternity have a sinister ring, especially when they come from people who want to curtail women\u2019s rights.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:58.925+0000"}
{"entityId": 1515, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Longtime Christie pal Joe Kyrillos switches his support to Jeb Bush in the 2016 sweepstakes. Is it payback for the governor\u2019s lukewarm assistance in Kyrillos\u2019s failed 2012 Senate run?\n\nA tall, deeply tanned older man walked briskly through the lobby of the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington on a Thursday evening in late February. He flashed a narrow politician's smile, revealing a row of tiny, off-white teeth\u2014and then he ran away from me.\n\nWell, he ran away after I asked a question: Did he believe Chris Christie should be president?\n\n\n\nThen, he fled.\n\nNew Jersey state Senator Joe Kyrillos should have seen it coming, that question, considering where he was: the location of a Christie speech, addressed to the state Chamber of Commerce. He should have seen it coming also because for more than two decades, Kyrillos had been, publicly, one of Christie\u2019s closest friends.\n\nIf stabbing his former friend in the back was Kyrillos\u2019s way of expressing his own hurt, denial that any stabbing has taken place is Christie\u2019s.\n\nBut now Kyrillos has turned on Christie, pledging his support\u2014in the form of a $10,000 donation\u2014to Jeb Bush, Christie\u2019s primary rival for the big-money establishment constituency. To add insult to injury, the news of Kyrillos\u2019s betrayal comes as Christie finds himself with his lowest job approval rating ever\u201438 percent, according to a Quinnipiac Poll released Monday.\n\nIs it really so hard to keep a friendship alive in politics?\n\nChristie and Kyrillos met, Kyrillos told me during a 2013 interview, in 1992, and Kyrillos long considered him a \u201cgood, old friend.\"\n\nThree years later, in 1995, Kyrillos presided over Christie\u2019s swearing-in ceremony for his first political office, Morris County Freeholder. Kyrillos can be seen in photos of the event, standing across from a young, thin Christie\u2014his right hand raised\u2014as Christie\u2019s wife and infant look on, smiling.\n\nWithout Kyrillos, Governor Christie might not exist: When Christie was nominated as the United States Attorney in 2002 by George W. Bush, it was Kyrillos, then chairman of the Republican State Committee, who helped ease concerns that the young appellate lawyer was too inexperienced to be the state\u2019s top prosecutor.\n\nChristie ran on his record as the U.S. Attorney during his 2009 gubernatorial race, of which Kyrillos served as chairman.\n\nAnd without Christie, Kyrillos\u2019s entire life could have turned out differently: The governor introduced Kyrillos to Susan, the woman who ultimately became his wife.\n\nDespite their rich history, Kyrillos had good reason to avoid answering my question in the lobby of the hotel that evening.\n\nA month before Christie\u2019s speech, in January, the New Jersey press reported that Kyrillos met with Jeb Bush, Christie\u2019s rival, in New York City on January 8.\n\nBush hosted Kyrillos, along with 14 other Garden State donors and operators, for dinner at the Union League Club in midtown. Bush went from table to table answering questions, according to The Record\u2019s Charles Stile, in the hope that his guests would each commit themselves to raising $100,000 for his campaign.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t immediately clear that Kyrillos had made up his mind about who to support. Besides his friendship with Christie, he said, he also had friendships with Bush, and with Mitt Romney who, at that point, had not yet decided against another bid for the White House. After the dinner, he told The Star-Ledger\u2019s Matt Friedman, \u201cI know and worked with these three over the years and it\u2019s a very interesting time in some ways, and a good thing for the country to have talent step up.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t reveal which way he was leaning, instead promising, \u201cI\u2019ll have more to say, so stay tuned.\u201d\n\nKyrillos didn\u2019t get the opportunity to say it himself. On Monday, The Washington Post\u2019s Robert Costa reported that Kyrillos donated $10,000 to Bush\u2019s political action committee, Right to Rise, in March. A Bush spokesman, Tim Miller, confirmed the donation\u2014and Kyrillos\u2019s support\u2014to the publication.\n\n\n\nA source close to Christie confirmed to me that Kyrillos did not warn the governor that he would not be supporting him in the Republican primary, or that he had made the donation. Kyrillos gave \u201cno heads-up beforehand,\u201d the source said.\n\nNot that Christie was blindsided.\n\nKyrillos and Christie\u2019s relationship had been deteriorating for years, beginning in 2012.\n\nThat year, Christie was as strong as he would ever be: pre-Bridgegate, he was a national superstar. Prominent Republicans were begging him to run for president\u2014but he said no. Instead, he acted as a surrogate for Romney, and waved off suggestions that he might make a fine vice president.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyrillos was trying to move up the political food chain. After 25 years in the legislature, he decided to challenge Senator Bob Menendez for his seat. Menendez, a longtime Christie foe, was formidable with his superhuman fundraising prowess\u2014but a cloud of scandal hovered around him (culminating in his indictment last month). With a lot of luck\u2014and even more help\u2014Menendez was potentially beatable.\n\nBut the help never came.\n\nWhile Christie aided Kyrillos in raising money for the campaign, he failed to contribute his invaluable star power, seldom publicly campaigning with his old friend. \u201cIf we were together every day, then what you guys would write is \u2018Poor Kyrillos, he can\u2019t run his own campaigns, so Christie\u2019s got to prop him up,\u2019\u201d Christie told reporters at the time. \u201cNo matter what I do, you guys will be critical.\u201d\n\n\n\nCome Election Day, Kyrillos was handily defeated by Menendez.\n\nThe following year, in 2013, Christie failed his old friend again. When a Senate seat was vacated with the death of Senator Frank Lautenberg, Christie was tasked with temporarily filling it. Kyrillos' bid for Menendez's seat left little question that he was interested in heading down to Washington, and he was suggested as a viable choice by members of his party. But Christie picked someone else: Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa, a different old friend from the U.S. Attorneys office. Kyrillos and those around him deny it now, but the rumor that he wanted that seat badly, and Christie publicly let him down \u2013 for a second time in two years \u2013 remains alive and well.\n\nSince making headlines Monday with his support for Bush, Kyrillos has been running away from reporters again\u2014this one included.\n\n\n\nBut a source close to Kyrillos stressed that there had not been \u201csome kind of huge falling out\u201d between him and Christie.\n\nBush, the source said, was also a longtime friend\u2014albeit a long-distance one. Kyrillos worked for then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's 1984 campaign, and first met Jeb in 1986, while he was chairman of the Dade County Republicans.\n\nIf stabbing his former friend in the back was Kyrillos\u2019s way of expressing his own hurt, denial that any stabbing has taken place is Christie\u2019s.\n\nA spokeswoman for his PAC, Sam Smith, said in a statement: \u201cGov. Christie has had a long time personal friendship with Joe and Susan Kyrillos and there is nothing that will happen in politics that will ever change his respect and regard for either of them.\u201d\n\nPolitics is just a hobby for him, after all.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story has been updated to include reference to Frank Lautenberg's Senate seat.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:59.109+0000"}
{"entityId": 1516, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "If the Iran deal goes through, the country\u2019s oil exports will resume. Meanwhile, U.S. producers will still be banned from doing so.\n\nAs Congress takes up the Iran nuclear deal next month, it ought to confront this paradox: The agreement allows the Iranians to do something Americans can\u2019t\u2014sell oil to the rest of the world.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong. I support the deal, under which Tehran would stop enriching weapons-grade uranium for the next 15 years in return for relief from economic sanctions. It\u2019s not perfect, but President Obama is right that it\u2019s better than what we\u2019d have if his conservative critics got their way\u2014no deal, leaving the Islamic Republic on the brink of acquiring nuclear weapons.\n\nStill, freeing Iran to crank up its oil exports stands in stark incongruity to what\u2019s happening here at home. Domestic oil production has soared by an amazing 68 percent over the past decade, yet we can sell very little of it abroad thanks to outdated laws banning U.S. oil and gas exports.\n\nPassed during the energy crisis of the 1970s, these laws were intended to protect the nation\u2019s then-dwindling oil and gas resources as a strategic reserve against supply disruptions like the Arab oil embargo. But the premise used to justify this deviation from our country\u2019s free-trade principles\u2014energy scarcity\u2014has been shattered by America\u2019s shale boom.\n\nNow the United States is estimated to have a least a century\u2019s worth of natural gas, and likely more. Last year, America momentarily passed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world\u2019s biggest oil producer. And despite plunging oil prices, U.S. companies have managed to hold production this year fairly steady (over 9 million barrels a day) by becoming more efficient.\n\nThe global oil glut, however, is dampening U.S. energy investment, industry profits, and job creation. The forecast is for more of the same, owing to a combination of slow growth in China and Europe, falling U.S. demand and the return of oil-rich Iraq and Iran to world crude markets. Not that U.S. consumers will mind: White House economists estimate that the average family will save about $700 this year from lower gas prices.\n\nWhether prices rise or fall, the United States won\u2019t be able to reap the full benefit of its shale energy windfall so long as anachronistic laws lock our exports out of global markets. Yet the White House shows little urgency about repealing them. In fact, energy remains the great exception to Obama\u2019s second-term push to open markets and expand trade.\n\nOver fierce opposition from unions and globophobic activists, his administration is negotiating sweeping transpacific and transatlantic trade pacts aimed at boosting U.S. exports and growth. A clear commitment to lifting America\u2019s export bans would make Obama\u2019s efforts to curb foreign protectionism more credible and consistent.\n\nIt would also strengthen the U.S. economy. Opening foreign markets to U.S. gas and oil would stimulate more investment and production, especially as prices rebound. This would boost economic growth, create tens of thousands of jobs that pay decent, middle-class wages and have a moderating effect on prices at the pump, which are benchmarked to global crude prices.\n\nSurging U.S. production already is reshaping the world\u2019s geopolitical landscape, adding to America\u2019s arsenal of \u201csoft\u201d power while undercutting the economic leverage of petro-states such as Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. U.S. net oil imports have been cut nearly in half, reducing our trade deficit and making our economy less vulnerable to supply disruptions and price shocks.\n\nAllowing U.S. oil to flow into world markets also would enable our friends and allies to diversify their energy portfolio and reduce their dependence on unstable or unfriendly suppliers. Japan, for example, imports about 83 percent of its oil from the Middle East. European leaders, leery of the continent\u2019s heavy reliance on Russian gas and oil, are calling on Washington to ease restrictions on U.S. energy exports, and to add an energy chapter to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement.\n\nThe idea that America can at last achieve \u201cenergy independence\u201d by hoarding its now abundant fossil resources is a strategic delusion. \u201cIf war in the Middle East, or the actions of a powerful regional hegemon seeking to blackmail the world should cut the flow of oil from the Middle East to Europe, India, China and/or Japan, the economic consequences to the United States would be enormous,\u201d the historian Walter Russell Mead told Congress in recent testimony.\n\nU.S. policy should aim instead at promoting energy security. In addition to diluting the ability of any resource-rich nation to manipulate oil prices or restrict supplies, rising U.S. exports would provide a politically stable and reliable source of energy and thereby help to make global markets more resilient against conflicts or natural disasters.\n\nOpposition to lifting the export bans comes mainly from environmentalists, who fear that the glut of cheap gas and oil will delay the growth of costlier renewable energy options like wind and energy. This is a reasonable fear, but it\u2019s best addressed by pricing carbon accurately, not depriving Americans of the economic and security benefits of energy abundance.\n\nThe export bans are likely to figure prominently in the coming debate on the Iran nuclear deal. A key lawmaker, Senate Energy and Commerce Committee Chair Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), is flagging the issue. \u201cThe general prohibition on exporting domestic crude oil amount to a de facto sanctions regime against U.S. producers,\u201d declares a committee staff report.\n\nPresident Obama can defuse such criticism\u2014and strengthen the case for the deal\u2014by leading the charge to restore free trade in energy.\n\nWill Marshall is the president of the Progressive Policy Institute.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:59.242+0000"}

I\u2019m running it for voters,\u201d Clinton explained to Keilar, an edge to her voice. That at least sounded truthful.

{"entityId": 1518, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A number of prominent conservatives seem convinced that Martin Luther King Jr. would have fought marriage equality. They are probably wrong.\n\nIn their fight against the Supreme Court\u2019s same-sex marriage decision, leading conservatives have been turning to an unlikely source for inspiration: Martin Luther King\u2019s \u201cLetter from Birmingham Jail\u201d (PDF), the collection of notes that King smuggled out of his jail cell during his eight-day detention for protesting the Jim Crow laws that sanctioned discrimination across the South.\n\nThe letter is one of the most iconic documents from of the Civil Rights era and includes King\u2019s observations on the injustice of segregation and the daily humiliations that black men and women were suffering in their public and private lives.\n\nFast forward 50-plus years to Sunday morning when pastor-turned-presidential candidate Mike Huckabee referenced King as he decried the same-sex marriage ruling handed down last week as \u201cjudicial tyranny.\u201d Huckabee also predicted that Christians across the country would \u201cgo the way of Martin Luther King,\u201d and disobey the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that same-sex marriages must be legal in all 50 states.\n\n\u201cIn his brilliant essay, the letters from a Birmingham jail, [King] reminded us, based on what St. Augustine said, that an unjust law is no law at all,\u201d Huckabee during an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cAnd I do think that we\u2019re going to see a lot of pastors who will have to make this tough decision.\u201d\n\nDays earlier, the National Organization for Marriage, which has long opposed marriage equality, cited the same clause in a blistering take down of the Court\u2019s ruling, comparing it to the 1857 Dred Scott decision that declared slavery constitutional.\n\nAs the marriage question has wound its way through the courts, conservatives from Franklin Graham to Tom DeLay and Dr. James Dobson (PDF) used the same portion of King\u2019s letter to make the case that the Court\u2019s decision to expand the right to marry would be unjust and immoral.\n\nAnd when a group of Alabama pastors gave Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore an award this year to recognize his efforts to stop same-sex marriage, they called it the \u201cLetter from a Birmingham Jail Award.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing never said a law is immoral if it doesn\u2019t line up with the Bible. He would never have said anything like that.\u201d\n\nBut King experts say the basic premise of equating King\u2019s fight against segregation with moral objections to same-sex marriage doesn\u2019t ring true to King\u2019s broader message of inclusion, tolerance and the rights of minorities to live by the laws of the majority.\n\n\u201cKing never said a law is immoral if it doesn\u2019t line up with the Bible. He would never have said anything like that. That\u2019s not the way he thought,\u201d said Doug Shipman, the founding director of the National Center for Civil Rights and Human Rights. \u201cIf you look at the letter, morality is bringing people together, not separating them from each other. So it seems odd that King would draw an exclusive line someplace.\u201d\n\nMore broadly, it also seems odd that some cultural and religious conservatives are increasingly appropriating not just the language of the Civil Rights movement, but are also identifying themselves as an oppressed minority in a country that remains mostly white and mostly Christian.\n\nOn Sunday, Roy Moore warned Alabama churchgoers that they should prepare for their persecution. \u201cWelcome to the new world,\u201d he said.\n\nAt a protest to keep the Confederate flag flying on the statehouse grounds in Alabama over the weekend, a woman carried a sign that read \u201cSouthern Lives Matter,\u201d which spawned the Twitter meme #SouthernLivesMatter. It was exactly as ugly a cocktail as you\u2019d expect from a combination of race, Twitter, and a discussion of the merits and shortcomings of the Confederacy.\n\nAt the same rally, a Confederate flag supporter told the AP, \u201cRight now, this past week with everything that is going on, I feel very much like the Jews must have felt in the very beginning of the Nazi Germany takeover. I mean I do feel that way, like there is a concerted effort to wipe people like me out, to wipe out my heritage and to erase the truths of history.\u201d\n\nThose truths of history make it impossible to draw a straight line from American slavery to Nazi Germany to the Jim Crowe South to today\u2019s conservatives, who have seen social change sweep across the country in the last week and felt powerless to stop it.\n\nHistorically accurate or not, that lack of power, that sense of being a victim to current events, has become a key element of the new populism on the right that candidates like Huckabee, Ted Cruz, Rick Santorum, and Scott Walker are trying to harness.\n\nThat explains Huckabee\u2019s and other conservatives\u2019 decision to graft the fight against gay marriage onto MLK\u2019s fight for Civil Rights. It also makes Ted Cruz\u2019s reaction to the marriage decision (telling an Iowa crowd that \u201cthe last 24 hours at the United States Supreme Court were among the darkest hours of our nation\u201d and hitting the \u201celites\u201d on the Court), make perfect sense. And it explains why Scott Walker would suggest a constitutional amendment on same-sex marriage that would be ratified by the states through a vote of the people.\n\nBy telling conservatives that their fight is as difficult and just and noble as those against slavery, segregation, and Nazism, the GOPers are not only endorsing conservatives\u2019 fight, they are also casting themselves as the next Lincoln, the next FDR, or the next MLK that history will require to overcome tyranny.\n\nWhen Huckabee quoted from King\u2019s letter on Sunday, it wasn\u2019t the first time. At the March for Marriage in front of the U.S. Capitol in 2014, he read lengthy passages of King\u2019s words from a white iPhone to the crowd that had gathered to protest same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cI wish I had penned those words,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cBut they were penned by someone who understood freedom, and understood that there was a time to stand up against law when it has become unjust. Those are the words that were penned in 1954 by Martin Luther King Jr. in his letter from the Birmingham Jail.\u201d\n\nAmong other omissions and inaccuracies, Huckabee botched the date King wrote the letter. It was in 1963.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:36:59.544+0000"}

As a result, Republicans are now blocking the nominee for attorney general. This and more on this week\u2019s episode of the 114th Congress.\n\nLeave it to Congress to mix abortion politics into a largely non-controversial debate about human trafficking.\n\nBut here we are.\n\nAbortion politics are threatening to torpedo a popular bipartisan bill to counter trafficking, and in the process further stall and maybe even sink the nomination of Loretta Lynch as attorney general.\n\nA first test comes Tuesday when the Senate votes whether to debate the anti-human-trafficking bill. Expecting to fall short of the filibuster-proof 60 by one or two votes, Republican leader Mitch McConnell over the weekend played what he thinks is his ace card: Loretta Lynch.\n\nMcConnell said he wouldn\u2019t call a vote to confirm Lynch until the Senate finishes its work on the trafficking bill, in effect holding Lynch hostage to an obscure anti-abortion provision that was added by the GOP, and that went unnoticed by Democrats until pro-choice groups pointed it out.\n\nThough the stalled legislation and the Lynch confirmation haven\u2019t gotten as much attention as the standoff over funding the Department of Homeland Security, the dynamics are similar.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the Democrats can back down,\u201d says Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cOnly one side can back down. I just don\u2019t know when.\u201d\n\nDenying a well-qualified nominee who would be the first black woman to be attorney general makes no sense when Republicans prefer Lynch to Eric Holder, and when they risk inflaming racial politics by blocking her.\n\nEven so, says Bennett, \u201cHer race is not likely to become a major issue. It\u2019s more about their inability to govern.\u201d\n\nLynch\u2014who has been confirmed twice by the Senate for her post as U.S. attorney in New York\u2014has been waiting for a vote for more than four months.\n\nThat\u2019s the longest anyone has waited in three decades for a key Cabinet position.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest in his Monday press briefing called it \u201cunconscionable.\u201d\n\nWhen McConnell assumed the leadership, he promised no government shutdowns, and that the GOP would get things done.\n\nHe barely avoided a shutdown over DHS funding, and now he\u2019s found himself yet again in a box of his own making.\n\nAnd, as usual, the argument has devolved to partisan bickering.\n\nDemocrats say Republicans violated the gentlemen\u2019s agreement between staffers from opposing parties: When the majority makes changes or additions to a bill, the minority is informed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how the Democrats can back down,\u201d says Matt Bennett, a co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group. \u201cOnly one side can back down. I just don\u2019t know when.\u201d\n\nInstead, Democrats say, Republicans inserted a provision in the trafficking bill that would make an anti-abortion measure known as the Hyde Amendment permanently disallow fines collected from traffickers to pay for abortions sought by their victims.\n\nOriginally passed in 1976 in response to the Supreme Court\u2019s legalization of abortion, the Hyde Amendment banned taxpayers\u2019 money from paying for abortions for women receiving Medicaid.\n\nIt\u2019s never been permanent law, yet it is customarily re-authorized every year.\n\nIn 1993, after the Clinton administration took office, rape and incest were added to life and health of the mother as exceptions.\n\nA source familiar with the language in the trafficking bill, and who supports it, concedes that the victims of trafficking likely could claim rape, and the language could be moot.\n\nYet, it is still fodder for another major standoff between the two parties. Republicans are right when they say the Hyde Amendment language is routine, but it is typically attached only to appropriations bills, and it\u2019s not permanent; it must be renewed annually.\n\nFour Democrats are expected to join 54 Republicans in Tuesday\u2019s vote to debate the trafficking bill: Bob Casey of Pennsylvania; Joe Manchin of West Virginia; Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota; and Joe Donnelly of Indiana.\n\nThe anti-abortion language slipped into the trafficking bill is \u201cappropriations gobbledygook,\u201d says Jim Manley, Democratic leader Harry Reid\u2019s former spokesman, even as he concedes Democratic staffers should have thoroughly read the 63-page bill and spotted the offending words.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until pro-choice groups saw it that the issue took on a life of its own and a bill certain to win broad bipartisan support became an albatross for McConnell.\n\n\u201cLeaving aside how it got in there, if Republicans really wanted to get this bill passed as they claim, they would just drop this language knowing it\u2019s highly objectionable to Democrats,\u201d says Manley.\n\nThat option is open to McConnell, though it would be at great political cost to his standing with the base of his party. McConnell is trying to cast Democrats as the obstructionists, and he\u2019s \u201cmade the calculation there are no political losses, that it\u2019s an inside-the-Beltway drama, starring McConnell and Reid,\u201d says Manley. \u201cMcConnell will spend a couple days talking about it, see if any Democrats are feeling the heat, and meanwhile Eric Holder is still sitting there.\u201d\n\nDemocrats lost the debate about the Hyde Amendment 40 years ago, and they\u2019ve been fighting a rear-guard action ever since.\n\nNamed after the Republican congressman who crafted it, Henry Hyde, its ban has been restricted to taxpayer funds, and extending it to cover fees collected by the government, and making it permanent, takes it to a whole new level.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like pro-choice activists can look to the Supreme Court for help or protection anymore,\u201d says Manley.\n\nSo what does this have to do with Lynch? Nothing.\n\nSo Congress is the battleground, and Lynch the collateral damage.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:00.016+0000"}

This isn\u2019t tiddly-winks we\u2019re playing.\u201d\n\nA recent Business Insider headline\u2014which Bush spokesman Tim Miller tweeted out on Monday\u2014blared that the former governor \u201cis more ruthless than he looks,\u201d a perception that today\u2019s comments could undergird.\n\nHe certainly didn\u2019t play tiddly-winks when criticizing opponents of warrantless bulk surveillance.\n\nWhen another attendee asked him about how to balance concerns about privacy and national security, he defended the Patriot Act.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re safer today because of the Patriot Act,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this notion that somehow\u2014you create a false narrative, that you say, as many on the left, and a few on our team but mostly on the left have said that our civil liberties are being violated\u2014it\u2019s not true!\u201d\n\nHe nearly yelled those last three words.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no evidence of it!\u201d he continued. \u201cYou can say it all you want, but if it\u2019s not true, then why would we give up something that has kept us safe?\u201d\n\nHe added that \u201cof course we need safeguards,\u201d and that those safeguards are the FISA courts.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m deeply troubled by this,\u201d he continued, \u201cbecause there is this narrative that has been built up right now that is quite dangerous for the homeland.\u201d\n\nHe then said that if there was a terrorist attack, then \u201cthe very same people that now are saying that our civil liberties are being violated are going to be critical of the people that said, Why don\u2019t you keep us safe.\u201d\n\nThen he paused.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset about it,\u201d he concluded.\n\nHe couldn\u2019t have been upset about how his speech went, though.\n\nIt was bookended by standing ovations\u2014the only speaker all day to bring the crowd to their feet.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:00.247+0000"}
{"entityId": 1522, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The presumptive Democratic nominee is laying down infrastructure across the country, warding off opponents and potentially creating a nightmare for the GOP.\n\nHillary Clinton got beat last time because she wanted to win big in Democratic strongholds, and she got outflanked. Now she\u2019s pursuing a 50-state strategy, starting with the primaries. She wants to compete everywhere and expand the map\u2014an audacious play, particularly for a candidate so synonymous with insularity and caution.\n\nUnlike the last time around, Clinton lacks any serious competition for the Democratic nomination. But despite the primaries looking like a cakewalk for her, Team Clinton isn\u2019t taking any chances, and is looking to lay down campaign infrastructure that would ward off Democratic opponents and then benefit her in the general election.\n\nHer campaign sent out a press release last week touting headlines across the country, including in Republican strongholds: \u201cHillary Clinton launches Wyoming campaign presence;\u201d \u201cFirst presidential candidate with a presence in Utah\u2014Hillary Clinton,\u201d and \u201cHillary Clinton dispatching a full-time organizer to Texas.\u201d\n\nPaid staffers are on the ground in all 50 states and the territories, but they won\u2019t be there long, says a Clinton aide. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is building a volunteer-driven organization in those 50 states and that means we\u2019re being very efficient with the dollars.\u201d Democrats have learned that paid staff are essential to jump-start any volunteer effort. But the Clinton staffers won\u2019t stay; they\u2019ll be gone by the end of May, replaced if all goes well with trained and enthusiastic volunteers.\n\nClinton was in Nevada on Tuesday, the only caucus state she won in 2008, in what her campaign insists is the first of many trips. Bill Clinton worked the Vegas scene that year, shaking hands with workers as their shifts ended, but it was too little too late: despite losing the popular vote, Barack Obama out-organized her in rural areas, and picked up one more delegate than Clinton.\n\nThis time around, Hillary wants her erstwhile Democratic rivals to know she won\u2019t neglect states that award delegates through caucuses the way she did in \u201908, giving Obama an opening that let him build the lead among delegates that made him the nominee.\n\nThe Iowa caucuses were her first stumble in 2008, and she recovered with an upset win in New Hampshire. But her campaign\u2019s failure to aggressively compete in caucus states sowed the seeds for her defeat. \u201cThere was a kind of a feeling back then that primaries had more validity than caucuses,\u201d says Geoff Garin, who polls for Priorities USA Action, a pro-Clinton super PAC.\n\nMore people vote in primaries, and they\u2019re seen as a purer expression of democracy than caucuses, which attract fewer voters, and are dominated by activists. \u201cBut I think that it\u2019s not a matter of which kind of election you prefer. You have to excel at primaries and caucuses,\u201d says Garin. \u201cIn a whole host of ways, Hillary for President 2.0 is much better suited temperamentally and attitudinally to running strong caucus campaigns.\u201d\n\nSomething could potentially derail Clinton, but it won\u2019t be because she didn\u2019t play the game in places she didn\u2019t think mattered.\n\nClinton in \u201908 had a \u201cBig State strategy,\u201d which didn\u2019t include establishing a base of operations in smaller and non-primary caucus states. She counted on decisive wins in big Super Tuesday states, and in key Democratic states that followed, like Ohio and Pennsylvania. She won Ohio decisively and Pennsylvania by 10 points, and she embarrassed party patriarch Ted Kennedy, who had endorsed Obama, by defeating Obama in Massachusetts.\n\nBut none of those victories could overcome the cushion of delegates that Obama was methodically building by competing in states that weren\u2019t on Clinton\u2019s \u201cBig State\u201d grid\u2014states like Colorado, Minnesota, Maine, Idaho, Alaska, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Kansas. Many of Obama\u2019s wins against Clinton came from Republican territory, which Hillary\u2019s overconfident campaign had decided to largely bypass.\n\nWhen analysts look back on \u201908, they tend to credit Obama with capturing lightning in a bottle, while Clinton is dismissed as a bad candidate, running a campaign of entitlement doomed from the start. That\u2019s unfair, says Joe Grandmaison, a Democratic activist and former party chair in New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cIf a decision had been made to compete in at least selected caucuses, it can be argued she would have been the nominee and elected president in November,\u201d he says. This was a critical mistake for Clinton because Democrats have proportional representation in primaries and caucuses. In theory at least, Clinton left a lot of delegates unclaimed by not aggressively competing in caucus states.\n\nHoward Dean popularized the phrase \u201c50-state strategy\u201d when he chaired the Democratic National Committee from 2005 to 2009. \u201cYou can\u2019t ever win those states if you don\u2019t try,\u201d says Grandmaison, who gives Dean credit for trying to rebuild the party in states where Democrats don\u2019t usually compete. Obama\u2019s election expanded the electoral map for Democrats, and Clinton is working to hold that ground and push the boundaries further.\n\nClinton\u2019s last campaign was plagued by infighting and indecision, and she lost, which made it by definition a bad campaign. But she came closer than people realize, and if she had organized in some of those fly-over red states, she might have won.\n\nNow her campaign is off to a good start from an organizing perspective. Forget the questions around the Clinton Foundation, and the Benghazi hearings; Garin calls them \u201cmud balls,\u201d and thinks she\u2019s dealing with them pretty well.\n\nSomething could potentially derail Clinton, but it won\u2019t be because she didn\u2019t play the game in places she didn\u2019t think mattered. And when the general election begins, she\u2019ll have a vast network of supporters to call on, potentially forcing Republicans to fight for states whose electoral votes they\u2019ve long taken for granted.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:00.491+0000"}

Some people I know who are certainly pro-deal and know something about all this found the agreed-upon framework to be more detailed than they expected, so that\u2019s good. But there are many more details to be worked out and many rivers to cross.\n\nBut you know who else I bet isn\u2019t an expert on these matters? Scott Walker. And I\u2019d invite the Wisconsin governor to join me in withholding judgment until we\u2019ve had the chance to study the fine print and ask experts what it all might mean, but I suspect that would be pretty futile. Greg Sargent on Thursday afternoon picked up on a revealing comment Walker made to, who else, a right-wing talk radio host. The host, Charlie Sykes, actually asked Walker a skeptical question. They get so discombobulated when someone who\u2019s supposed to be on the team asks a real question. And look at what Walker said:\n\nSYKES: You have said that you would cancel any Iranian deal the Obama administration makes. Now would you cancel that even if our trading partners did not want to reimpose the sanctions?\n\nWALKER: Absolutely. If I ultimately choose to run, and if I\u2019m honored to be elected by the people of this country, I will pull back on that on January 20, 2017, because the last thing\u2014not just for the region but for this world\u2014we need is a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\n\n\nBy \u201cour trading partners,\u201d Sykes means chiefly England, France, and Germany\u2014the other countries (along with Russia and China) involved in the Switzerland negotiations. This is a major point of disagreement between liberals and conservatives, because conservatives say that we should have walked away from the Lausanne table and regrouped with our trading partners and imposed even tougher sanctions to bring Iran more quickly to its knees. Liberals contend, as President Obama did during his Rose Garden announcement of the deal, that these partners don\u2019t want to maintain sanctions, and that if we\u2019d walked away, it would have been the sanctions regime that that would have cracked, not Iran.\n\nSo Sykes was saying here to Walker: If the sanctions collapse, which will leave Iran on stronger economic footing and take out of our hands the one club over them we have\u2014even at the risk of that happening, you\u2019d cancel a deal? And Walker said yes. Not \u201cdepends on the deal.\u201d Just \u201cabsolutely.\u201d\n\nThe man is not in the realm of evidence here. He is in the realm of dogma, and dogma is all we\u2019re going to get from these people. As I\u2019m writing these words, we have yet to see the statements from most of the GOP presidential contenders, but gaming out what they\u2019re going to say is hardly history\u2019s greatest guessing game. Marco Rubio did come out of the gate pretty fast with a statement whose money line referred to \u201cthis attempt to spin diplomatic failure as a success.\u201d You remember him: the same Rubio who doesn't know that Iran and ISIS are enemies.\n\nI once thought there would be a chance that Rand Paul might say something more interesting. He\u2019s \u201cdark,\u201d his press office says, until after Easter, so we\u2019re apparently not getting anything out of him now. But no matter. Whatever his past interesting heterodoxies on foreign policy, he now knows he just has to bash Obama and say what the rest of them are saying, and so in all likelihood he will.\n\nThis seems a most apt time to remember some aspects of the neoconservative track record that they\u2019d rather the rest of us forget.\n\nThus, one interesting question for the coming weeks: Will there be one Republican, just one, either among the candidates or in the Congress, who will actually step forward to say something like, \u201cYou know, now that I\u2019ve read this and talked to experts, I\u2019ve concluded that it\u2019s worth giving this a shot?\u201d One? You probably laughed at the naivet\u00e9 of the question. I admit it does sound naive, but this shouldn\u2019t allow us to lose sight of the fact that it\u2019s tragic that things have come to this point, that we simply accept in such a ho-hum way that the Republicans are going to oppose anything with Obama\u2019s name on it, not just when it comes to tax policy and such, but matters of war and peace.\n\nThis seems a most apt time to remember some aspects of the neoconservative track record that they\u2019d rather the rest of us forget. North Korea is one, remember that one? The Hermit Kingdom started working on a nuclear program in earnest in the 1980s. In 1993, the North Koreans threatened to withdraw from the nonproliferation treaty. Diplomacy then commenced under Bill Clinton, leading to the 1994 Agreed Framework. The Framework had a checkered history\u2014mostly because (cough cough) hardliners in Congress repeatedly refused to let the United States live up to its side of the agreement\u2014but the long and short of it was that in the 1990s, North Korea didn\u2019t aggressively pursue a nuclearization program.\n\nThen came the neocons, and Dubya, and the axis of evil business, and soon enough North Korea was enriching uranium like there was no tomorrow. Remember the test bombs it was launching about a decade ago out toward Japan? All that started because Pyongyang took Bush at his belligerent word. Today it\u2019s estimated that North Korea has enough separated plutonium for six to eight bombs. We rattle our saber, it makes smaller countries want to go nuclear. It\u2019s really not very complicated.\n\nFar from weakening North Korea, the neocon posture strengthened it. And speaking of strengthening, what about Iran? It\u2019s the neocons\u2019 war in Iraq that gave Iraq to Iran. They strengthened Iran. And if they get their way they\u2019re going to do it again, if and when they manage to kill this deal and then Iran says OK, the hell with you, we\u2019re building the bomb as fast as we can.\n\nI\u2019m not all yippee, Nobel Peace Prize for Kerry about this deal. I expressed my reservations the other day, and they remain. The administration deserves credit on one level just for getting this far\u2014negotiations like these are amazingly hard. But we\u2019re still only across midfield here.\n\nEven so, if it\u2019s hard to decide what precisely to be for, it\u2019s laughably easy to figure out what to be against: reflexive and dogmatic opposition undertaken for the purposes of making sure you get your anti-Obama ticket stamped that will hasten the day either that a) Iran gets the bomb or b) we start a war to prevent that. Maybe it\u2019s a little cliched to say give peace a chance, but thanks to the neoconservatives, we\u2019ve given war plenty of chance, and all it\u2019s done is strengthened Tehran and given us ISIS.

{"entityId": 1524, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Like most liberals, I like our vice president. But this idea that he\u2019s some kind of white knight savior for Dems is more than a little far fetched.\n\nSeveral weeks before Maureen Dowd was feeding us dialogue from Beau Biden\u2019s deathbed, the chief promoter of a Joe Biden presidential candidacy was a fellow named Dick Harpootlian, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party. Here, for example, is a U.S. News piece from back in June, when Harpootlian was acting as a one-man p.r. machine for Biden. \u201cI think he was seriously considering it, but he was seriously distracted by Beau being in Walter Reed,\u201d Harpootlian is quoted as saying in that article. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything to convince me to say that it wasn't still something he was thinking about.\u201d\n\nIs Harpootlian driven by some quasi-mythic faith in la forza del Joe\u2019s destino? Maybe. But the record sure appears to reflect that he is also driven by an intense dislike of the Clintons. During the heated 2008 South Carolina primary, Harpootlian compared Bill Clinton to Lee Atwater. Now, that primary was far from Bill Clinton\u2019s finest hour. But Lee Atwater he ain\u2019t. Looks like there\u2019s a history there\u2014a history Democrats ought to be aware before the former chairman of a state where the Democratic Party has lost nearly everything it was mathematically possible to lose in the last generation becomes a major national power broker.\n\nLike most liberals, I like Joe Biden fine. He\u2019s mostly stood for good things over the years. Although it should be asked\u2014and will, if he enters the race, especially against a woman\u2014what percent of the responsibility he bears for the fact that Clarence Thomas sits on the Supreme Court. This is the story of Angela Wright, the former Thomas employee who had tales that corroborated Anita Hill\u2019s testimony but by bipartisan agreement (Biden chaired the Judiciary Committee at the time) was not allowed to testify. She spent a weekend in an Arlington motel waiting to be called, but never was. You might be hearing more about her.\n\nWait, I digress. What I meant to say was, generally, I like Biden fine and think he\u2019s been a steady and admirable public servant, and I\u2019m at a loss for words over the personal grief he\u2019s endured. I don\u2019t mind the famous malapropisms, for the most part; God knows Washington could use more people who depart from script on occasion.\n\nIt\u2019s no mystery why some Democrats are nervous about Hillary Clinton. But if they\u2019re thinking that Biden is some kind of white knight who can ride in and sort everything out, I would suggest they\u2019re mistaken. Biden has sought the presidency twice before. In 1988, he didn\u2019t even make it out of the starting blocks. Indeed he didn\u2019t even make it to 1988, because the revelation that he was cribbing autobiographical speech lines from British Labour leader Neil Kinnock chased him from the race in 1987.\n\nThen, in 2008, he rarely if ever got out of single digits. With a first tier comprised of Barack Obama, John Edwards, and Clinton, Biden never got out of the second tier. He finished fifth in Iowa with 0.9 percent of the vote and said sayonara that night.\n\nThat\u2019s not a track record that screams white knight to me. And every Democratic insider surely knows this. So what\u2019s going on here?\n\nIt seems clear that a little Clinton panic is going on, based on that one Quinnipiac poll that showed her losing to some Republicans in key states, and on the continuing Times jihad over her emails.\n\nThere are ways in which this is silly. That July 22 Q-poll looks increasingly aberrant, as legitimate polls have come out since showing Clinton with the same kind of 5- to 7-point leads over the first-tier Republicans that she\u2019s had for a year. As for the email story, that\u2019s a little less silly, as a political concern. No one has yet adduced any proof that Clinton did anything wrong, but that doesn\u2019t mean the Republicans aren\u2019t going to spend the next 15 months trying to suggest otherwise, and the proof-less suggestions have obviously done Clinton some damage in the last month. But panic? It seems a touch early for that.\n\nThe other point made in Biden\u2019s favor is the old \u201cpersonal affect-slash-authenticity\u201d argument\u2014that he displays a certain exuberance on the trail, while she is, to use a word I saw in the Times yesterday sourced to a \u201cprominent Democratic party official\u201d who may or may not be named Harpootlian, \u201cjoyless.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t mind the famous malapropisms, for the most part; God knows Washington could use more people who depart from script on occasion.\n\nWell, compared to Biden, yes, she is kind of joyless. Methodical and serious is how I would more charitably put it, but okay, fine, call it true. But again, in 2008, Democratic voters were given an opportunity to back either her grim earnestness or his joie de politique. Earnestness got 17 million votes, and joie captured 23. Not 23,000 or even 2,300; I mean 23 votes from Iowa caucus-goers. [UPDATE: This isn\u2019t quite right. I took these numbers from a New York Times vote summary, but it was weighted to reflect the number of state convention delegates each candidate would win based on the actual votes cast. It seems that Biden actually got a few hundred votes, but the 0.9 percentage is correct.]\n\nBelieve me, as the guy who wrote a book about her 2000 campaign, which I see you can now literally (to use a favorite Biden word) buy for as little as one penny (!), I\u2019ve probably written as many \u201cIf only Hillary could loosen up\u201d sentences as any journalist in America. But I have recognized, too, the sexism so clearly coded in the way many people say it. For God\u2019s sakes, Jeb Bush on the trail makes Clinton look like Sarah Silverman. But you don\u2019t see many \u201cWho Is Jeb, Really?\u201d stories. Men just aren\u2019t written about in that way.\n\nAnybody who has the means to run for president and wants to run ought to run. If Biden does get in and she beats him, well, that\u2019s one less woulda-shoulda-coulda hypothetical that will loom over Clinton. If he gets in and wins, well, he\u2019ll have earned it because by definition, the nominee is the person who earns it. But there\u2019s no reason to think Biden is some kind of rescuer. He\u2019s had two shots at this and has flamed out both times, and there must be a reason for that.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:00.966+0000"}

In another, he stared down at ripped, tanned abs, dressed in nothing but American flag-printed swim trunks and sneakers.\n\n\u201cOlivia ... Thanks for emailing me about your interest in Advocare,\u201d the message began.\n\nFounded in 1993 by Charles E. Ragus, an insurance salesman who had worked for Herbalife, a nutrition company which may or may not be a Ponzi scheme, AdvoCare is a \u201cwellness\u201d brand that \u201cBuilds Champions \u00ae\u201d and is \u201cbacked by the latest science,\u201d according to its website. Ragus died in 2001, at 58. His obituary doesn\u2019t cite a cause.\n\nAdvoCare products, just like Herbalife, are not available for purchase in traditional stores, which is why they are successful: The goods are given to \u201cindependent Distributors,\u201d who then sell them to people they know, and if they recruit other people to hawk the products, they make a commission on their sales. This is technically called \u201cmulti-level marketing,\u201d but you may call it a gigantic scam.\n\nI had not, in fact, emailed Brown about my \u201cinterest in Advocare.\u201d I had contacted him to request an interview about his diet after he took to Facebook last week to tell the world about it.\n\nOn June 25, Brown wrote to his 300,000 fans (?) to \u201canswer a few questions that people have had about my recent weight loss.\u201d He explained that he and Gail realized they had gained weight and they decided to embark on a diet together. Luckily for them, Brown said, their son-in-law \u201cturned me onto a product called Advocare,\u201d which he claimed \u201cguaranteed\u201d a 15-pound weight loss in 24 days.\n\nBrown said he liked that it was \u201call natural\u201d and only cost him \u201cpretty short money, about $180 in total.\u201d\n\n\n\nBrown says the products helped him lose 42 pounds. He included two photos as proof: the same sunburned \u201cbefore\u201d picture, which appeared in my email, and a different \u201cafter\u201d photo: sinewy and tan in tight Spandex workout clothes, a triathlon medal around his neck and his thumb raised.\n\nHe encouraged people to talk to him about healthy living at scottbrowntri@gmail.com.\n\nIt was not supposed to end this way for Scott Brown, emailing strangers pictures of his pecs and waxing poetic about diet supplements.\n\nBrown rose to prominence in 2010, when he defied the odds of his long-shot Republican candidacy and won the special election to fill the Massachusetts Senate seat vacated by the death of Teddy Kennedy. Brown went from unknown to instant star, due almost entirely to the fact that, in 1982, he won Cosmopolitan\u2019s \u201cAmerica's Sexiest Man\u201d competition and posed nude in the June issue.\n\nBut Brown\u2019s Senate career would not last. In 2012, he was ousted by Democrat Elizabeth Warren. Two years later, he ran for the Senate again\u2014except this time, from New Hampshire. Dogged by charges of carpetbagging, he was narrowly defeated.\n\nAnd now he's in my inbox and who knows how many other inboxes without a shirt.\n\n\u201cI am here to help you get started,\u201d Brown\u2019s email read. \u201cAs you can see from my story and pictures, these products from Advocare really do work.\u201d\n\nIt was not supposed to end this way for Scott Brown, emailing strangers pictures of his pecs and waxing poetic about diet supplements.\n\n\n\nBrown went on to say that \u201cas a fitness advocate\u201d (he\u2019s competed in half a dozen triathlons) \u201cI am very skeptical about many products out there,\u201d but his son-in-law, Keith, \u201cused Advocare products through his 8 year professional baseball career\u201d and that was enough to convince him to jeopardize his well-being for vanity.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re ready to get your health back on track,\u201d Brown said, \u201callow Keith and me to get you signed up today!\u201d\n\nBrown is offering me the following: \u201c20-40% off products\u201d if I become an AdvoCare distributor; \u201cNutrition and Fitness guidance to maximize your results\u201d; and \u201cproduct regimens to help you reach your goals.\u201d\n\nIn the comment section of Brown\u2019s Facebook post, he wrote, \u201cFYI I'm not a paid spokesman for them. Neither is Gail,\u201d and in a separate post, two hours after the initial post, he reiterated, \u201cJust as an update which I put out as a comment on the original post, neither Gail nor I are paid spokesrepresentatives for Advocare [sic].\u201d He added, \u201cSome of you have to relax a little bit.

Ha.\u201d\n\nI emailed both the gmail account Brown provided on his Facebook as well as his personal email address to ask if he or his son-in-law are profiting in any way from his advertisements.

They call it a \u201cnutrient glossary,\u201d and it includes things like Vitamin D, Niacin, and something called Beta-phenyl-Gamma-aminobutyric acid \u201c(GABA) (phenibut).\u201d In 2008, swimmer Jessica Hardy was forced to resign from the U.S. Olympic Team after she tested positive for clenbuterol, a performance-enhancing drug. She blamed AdvoCare, saying she was unaware the substance was used in their products.\n\nReviews of AdvoCare seem to be overwhelmingly negative. On Amazon, where you can purchase the 24 Day Challenge that allegedly worked wonders for Brown for $179, users report itching, swelling, rashes, uncontrollable shaking, headaches, constipation, nausea, vomiting, high blood pressure, heart palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, blurred vision\u2014and subsequent ER visits.\n\nI asked Brown if he had ever experienced any side effects while taking the product, and he responded, \u201cNot at all I\u2019ve been taking the products with Advocare for 10 years and they have treated me great.

It did not end well.\n\nRepublican primary front-runner Donald Trump pledged Tuesday morning, in a factually-challenged screed, to send American troops to invade Iraq and Syria so as to \u201ctake the oil\u201d in ISIS-controlled territories.\n\n\u201cI would go in and take the oil and I\u2019d put troops to protect the oil. I would absolutely go and I\u2019d take the money source away. And believe me, they would start to wither and they would collapse,\u201d Trump said on CNN\u2019s New Day. \u201cI would take the oil away, I\u2019d take their money away.\u201d\n\nAsked last month whether U.S. troops were needed to protect the oil, Trump said, \u201cYou put a ring around them. You put a ring.\u201d\n\nIronically, Trump said he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, saying in May that he would \u201chave never been in Iraq.\u201d Some 200,000 troops were required for that invasion.\n\nSenator Lindsey Graham, one of the most hawkish members of the GOP presidential field, has called for between 10,000 and 20,000 troops to bolster the anti-ISIS campaign.\n\nTrump\u2019s word-salad foreign policy also fundamentally misunderstands the nature of ISIS. While it does make some money from oil sales, the so-called Islamic State does not derive its main source of revenue from oil revenue, as The New York Times points out. The vast majority of its operating resources in 2014 came from extortion, taxation, and theft.\n\nThe U.S.-led coalition has struck portions of ISIS\u2019s oil infrastructure as recently as three weeks ago. On July 20, military airstrikes hit three ISIS crude oil collection points near the Deir Ezzor. A recent CNN article, citing military experts, points out that destroying oil infrastructure would be counterproductive to the future recovery of territories held by ISIS if and when the terrorist organization is expelled.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand the issues a little bit better than just bombing things,\u201d retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling told CNN.\n\n\u201cYou have to understand the issues a little bit better than just bombing things,\u201d retired Lieutenant General Mark Hertling told CNN.\n\nNor does Trump seem to understand the basic dynamics of the Middle East. \u201cBelieve it or not, Iran is funneling money to ISIS, too,\u201d Trump said Tuesday morning. Iran\u2019s government is a theocracy based on Shia Islam, while ISIS is a terror group based on a jihadist branch of Sunni Islam. They see each other as mortal enemies. In fact, Iran has been willing to offer Iraq an \u201copen check\u201d to fight the extremist group, Iraqi Ambassador to the U.S. Lukman Faily has said.\n\nTrump also criticized the Iran deal negotiated by the Obama administration. His Iran deal would be \u201ca hundred times better,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThey didn't read The Art of the Deal, obviously.\u201d First Trump would have \u201cdoubled the sanctions,\u201d demanded Iranian-held American prisoners back, and then \u201cmade a good deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to go down as one of the dumb deals of all time, and one of the most dangerous deals ever signed,\u201d Trump said.\n\nWhen challenged by CNN about how America\u2019s allies weren't likely to go along with additional sanctions, Trump gave a bewildering answer. \u201cI don\u2019t care\u2014that's part of leadership, you got to get the allies with you. You got to get them\u2026 The different people that are involved aren't going to be with you. You know why? Because they have no respect for our president.\u201d\n\nCNN host Chris Cuomo almost seemed like he was apologizing to Trump for asking tough questions about national security.\n\n\u201cForgive me if it sounds if I\u2019m teaching you about the world. You know it, and I know you know it. But I\u2019m saying that there's a tendency to oversimplify situations, people buy into that, and you\u2019re setting them up for disappointment,\u201d Cuomo said.\n\n\u201cSometimes oversimplification is a good thing.

In fact, he didn\u2019t invade any countries, or raise any taxes, because he is president only in a land of make believe.\n\nThese characters are fictional, and even the morally ambiguous or Machiavellian ones are written to be sympathetic or alluring for the sake of compelling TV. This is about as instructive as polling the American people about who is the superior leader: Barack Obama, Santa Claus, or the cutest Ewok from the Star Wars franchise.\n\nFictional characters and celebrities are already at a pop-cultural advantage when it comes to approval ratings.

Shortly before the 2000 election, an NBC poll showed that The West Wing\u2019s Bartlet would get more votes than Bush and Gore put together. So it\u2019s hardly news that a popular fake president would score higher than a real one who is still alive and making policy decisions in a politically polarized America.\n\nSure, no news organization is above click-bait.

{"entityId": 1529, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "When FDR died just a few months into his fourth term he had transformed American life in nearly every way. His achievements, and the obstacles he overcame, should not be forgotten.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, just three months into his fourth term and only 63 years old, passed away in Warm Springs, Georgia. Asked to provide a short eulogy for nationwide broadcast, Pultizer Prize winning playwright Robert Sherwood, who had joined FDR\u2019s White House team in 1940 and directed the Overseas Division of the Office of War Information in 1942-44, wrote: \u201cTo those of us who knew and loved the President \u2026 the greatest memory we hold today is the memory of his indomitable good humor\u2014his indomitable courage\u2014his love for our country, his faith in our country\u2026\u201d It was that love and that faith, Sherwood stated, which not only enabled Roosevelt to confront the crises of economic depression and war without fear or hesitation, but also made him \u201cone with every man who has fought for our country.\u201d Indeed, Sherwood said: \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a moment \u2026 when he wasn\u2019t spiritually on the front line with the men who were fighting for freedom.\u201d And finally, after urging Americans to honor their fallen president by \u201cpledging renewed and increased devotion to the country and cause which he served so valiantly and for which he gave his life,\u201d Sherwood declared: \u201cWe do not surrender to Death, as we would not surrender to the Nazis or Japanese. We continue to stand up and fight for our country and our cause. We continue to fight for Freedom of speech, Freedom of religion, Freedom from want, Freedom from fear.\u201d\n\nIn the course of his twelve years as President, FDR had rallied Americans to fight the Great Depression and then Fascism. In the 1930s, he inspired, encouraged, and empowered them to redeem the nation\u2019s promise and possibilities by taking up the labors and struggles of relief, recovery, reconstruction and reform known as the New Deal. Together, president and people severely tested each other, made mistakes and regrettable compromises, and suffered defeats and disappointments. But challenging each other to live up to their finest ideals, they ended up beating the Depression and advancing those ideals further than either had expected or even imagined possible.\n\nConfronting fierce opposition from the right and conservative rich, they not only rejected authoritarianism, but also initiated revolutionary changes in American government and public life and radically extended American freedom, equality, and democracy. They subjected big business to public account and regulation, empowered the federal government to address the needs of working people, organized labor unions, fought for their rights, broadened and leveled the \u201cWe\u201d in \u201cWe the People,\u201d established a social security system, expanded the nation\u2019s public infrastructure, improved the environment, cultivated the arts, refashioned popular culture, and\u2014while much remained to be done\u2014imbued themselves with fresh democratic convictions, hopes, and aspirations.\n\nThen, in January 1941, when Roosevelt knew that a generation\u2019s \u201crendezvous with destiny\u201d had arrived, he put into words\u2014the words of the Four Freedoms\u2014all that Americans had been striving for not just since 1933 but, no less, since 1776. And once again President and People mobilized.\n\nTo beat the Axis Powers\u2014Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, Imperial Japan\u2014they turned the United States into the Arsenal of Democracy and themselves into Citizen Soldiers, workers in the War Effort, and volunteers on the Home Front. But even as they did so, they continued to press for greater freedom, equality, and democracy. Once again, President and people severely tested each other, made terrible mistakes and regrettable compromises, and suffered tragic defeats and disappointments. And yet, once again, they not only took up the necessary fight, but also, as they had in the 1930s, compelled each other to enhance American democratic life in the process. Despite continuing conservative opposition, they expanded the labor, consumer, and civil-rights movements, subjected industry and the marketplace to greater public control, reduced inequality and poverty, and further transformed the \u201cWe\u201d in \u201cWe the People.\u201d Moreover, they embraced new initiatives\u2014such as the GI Bill\u2014to rebuild the nation, and expand freedom, equality, and democracy, at war\u2019s end and they looked forward to making the Four Freedoms all the more real by enacting the social-democratic \u201cEconomic Bill of Rights\u201d that FDR himself called for in 1944.\n\nThey had done it all, contrary to the dire predictions of conservatives and isolationists, without turning their own democracy into a dictatorship.\n\nRoosevelt\u2019s death shocked Americans. One Detroit woman exclaimed: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem possible. It seems to me that he will be back on the radio tomorrow, reassuring us all that it was just a mistake.\u201d And Pfc. Lester Rebuck, a medic with the 104th Infantry Division, told a journalist in Paris: \u201cIt was just like somebody socked me in the stomach when I wasn\u2019t looking. I just couldn\u2019t get it through my head he was really dead.\u201d\n\nThe nation grieved. But the people Roosevelt had led for twelve years were not about to fall to pieces. His presidential legacy was not simply a personal one. It was also a democratic one. Sounding every bit the American that FDR himself had so admired, Private Rebuck quickly went on to say: \u201cFor my money, that guy was one of the greatest guys that ever lived. You can put him next to Lincoln or Washington or anybody.\u201d Noting the diversity of the mourners who lined the funeral procession\u2019s route through Washington, Nation columnist I.F. Stone reflected: \u201cSomehow we pulled through before, and somehow we\u2019ll pull through again. In part it was luck. In part it was Mr. Roosevelt\u2019s leadership. In part it was the quality of the country and its people. I don\u2019t know about the rest of the four freedoms, but one thing Mr. Roosevelt gave the United States in one crisis after another\u2026 was freedom from fear.\u201d And the GI editors of Yank wrote, \u201cIf Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s hopes and dreams are deep enough in the hearts and minds of the people, the people will make them come true.\u201d\n\nJust weeks after FDR\u2019s passing, Hitler committed suicide and Nazi Germany surrendered. The struggle continued in Asia and the Pacific. But on May 8, Americans and their allies celebrated V-E Day. That same night, CBS broadcast On A Note of Triumph, a play that the great radio writer and producer Norman Corwin had prepared specifically for that long-awaited and hard-fought-for moment. Its opening lines clearly voiced the popular exultation:\n\nSo they\u2019ve given up.\n\nThey\u2019re finally done in, and the rat is dead in an alley back of the\n\nWilhelmstrasse.\n\nTake a bow, G.I.,\n\nTake a bow, little guy.\n\nThe superman of tomorrow lies at the feet of you common men of this afternoon.\n\nThis is It, kid, this is The Day, all the way from Newburyport to Vladivostok.\n\nYou had it what it took and you gave it, and each of you has a hunk of rainbow\n\n\u2018round your helmet.\n\nSeems like free men have done it again.\n\nMany more Americans were still to die in liberating the Philippines and in taking Okinawa and it looked like the struggle might go on for many months to come. But suddenly, on August 14, after the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Imperial Japan, too, finally gave up. And on September 2, 1945, the war was officially over.\n\nSoon\u2014though not soon enough for all concerned\u2014the troops started returning to America, and they were welcomed home as heroes. But they themselves knew otherwise.\n\nEvery son of a World War II combat veteran remembers the silence they met when, years later, they asked their fathers about \u201cthe war.\u201d We all got the same response: \u201cThe real heroes never came home.\u201d\n\nAmericans had sailed on every kind of warship from destroyers and aircraft carriers to submarines and minesweepers; they had flown bombers, fighters, and gliders; and they had driven tanks, trucks, and jeeps. They had built roads, bridges, buildings, and docks, hauled men and goods, and landed on and battled their way on foot, and many times on their bellies, through every imaginable\u2014for many, previously unimaginable\u2014landscape and climate. And they had tended the wounded and buried the dead. Not all saw combat, but many did, and the sacrifices were great\u2014more than 400,000 never made it home and of those who did 800,000 had been wounded or injured. Many millions more had labored in factories, fields, shipyards, offices, and every mode of transport to produce and deliver the weapons and supplies to make victory possible. Here, too, the costs were tremendous\u2014300,000 lost their lives on the job and 1,000,000 suffered some permanent disability.\n\nYes, the world needed radical reconstructing. Yes, the powers and profits of capital had grown. Yes, racism and segregation persisted. And yes, there were those both in and out of Congress who were eager not just to \u201cfile away the Four Freedoms with the Ten Commandments,\u201d but also to erase any and all references to the idea of an Economic Bill of Rights and to halt, if not reverse, the democratic advances of the past twelve years.\n\nNevertheless, Americans had transcended the Great Depression, destroyed their enemies, and liberated millions. Moreover, they had done it all, contrary to the dire predictions of conservatives and isolationists, without turning their own democracy into a dictatorship. Indeed, against the ambitions and efforts of so many of the former, Americans had not only sustained the nation\u2019s democratic life, but also continued to make the United States freer, more equal, and more democratic in the process. Regulating capital and the economy, they had made the commonwealth richer, and progressively transformed the \u201cWe\u201d in \u201cWe the People.\u201d Working people were better off, better organized, and all the more conscious of what they could accomplish. Blacks and Latinos, too, were better off, better organized, and more determined to lay claim to their rights as citizens. And women had stepped into every realm of public life and proved themselves indispensable to both winning the war and improving the state of the nation.\n\nOur fathers and mothers and their generation have come down to us over time as the greatest generation and surely their achievement was as great as any generation of Americans. Nonetheless, the superlative justly attaches to them not because of the clarity of the evil they confronted, but because of the purpose with which they fought, bled, and died. An overwhelming percentage of adult Americans were swept up not just in four years of war, but in twelve years of struggle across fronts both foreign and domestic. Measuring their accomplishments in beachheads and battles won has become the easier work of later generations. However, the generation that actually engaged those struggles so successfully kept a different yardstick.\n\nMobilized by Roosevelt, the Americans of the New Deal and Second World War had fought, labored, and sacrificed in the name of democracy and the Four Freedoms. Those who died in the struggle could not speak. But their fellow citizens\u2014especially the soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen who had fought alongside them\u2014surely heard them. Given just one night to prepare a program for nationwide broadcast on the evening of the Japanese surrender, Corwin composed a \u201cmessage of victory\u201d titled simply 14 August. And he closed it with these words: \u201cRemember them when July comes round\u2026 Remember them in the fall of the year\u2026 Remember them in the sleeting months \u2026\n\nThey\u2019re dead as clay for the rights of men,\n\nFor people the likes of you,\n\nAnd they ask that we do not fail them again\n\nTomorrow, tomorrow.\n\nHarvey J.

{"entityId": 1530, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In 2008, the NRA honcho said Obama was going to confiscate guns. Now, Hillary wants to. The lies will never end.\n\n\u201cThey are coming to take your guns away!\u201d That was the message from this past weekend\u2019s annual NRA Convention. In fact, it\u2019s the same message we have heard for years from the NRA. And just as it has been in the past, as it was this weekend, that message is a lie.\n\nNo one in the Obama administration or any Democratic administration has ever tried to take law-abiding citizens guns away. Even when President Bill Clinton signed into law the assault weapons ban in 1994, which expired in 2004, it \u201cgrandfathered in weapons and ammo clips produced or purchased before the enactment of the ban.\u201d\n\nThere are now nearly 300 million guns in the United States. It would be impossible to take even a fraction of those guns away from people. And more importantly, the government can\u2019t, because the United States Supreme Court in 2008 interpreted the Second Amendment as bestowing a personal constitutional right to own a firearm.\n\nThe NRA knows all this. But still, look at the scare tactics it employed this weekend at its convention in Nashville.\n\nFor starters, the motto for this year\u2019s convention was: \u201cIf they can ban one, they can ban them all.\u201d So fear was the very slogan. Then, the NRA\u2019s Executive Vice President and CEO Wayne LaPierre upped the fear factor by telling the attendees: \u201cThere's no telling how far President Obama will go to dismantle our freedoms and reshape America into an America that you and I will not even recognize.\u201d Now even assuming Obama wanted to somehow \u201cdismantle our freedoms,\u201d as LaPierre claims, how could Obama do that in the final 18 months of his presidency when the Republicans control the Senate, the House, and the Supreme Court?\n\nHe can\u2019t, and the NRA knows that. But facts don\u2019t matter when you are trying to scare people (and get their money). In fact, they often get in the way.\n\nNow scaring people (aka lying) about Obama is nothing new for the NRA. It started even before he took office. While Obama was campaigning for president in 2008 he stated that the Second Amendment bestowed a personal right to own guns and that he \u201cwill protect the rights of hunters and other law-abiding Americans to purchase, own, transport, and use guns.\u201d\n\nPretty clear, right? But the NRA publicly claimed that Obama wanted to \u201cban use of firearms for home self defense\u201d and \u201cban the manufacture, sale and possession of handguns.\u201d That was simply and utterly a fabrication by the NRA.\n\nUnsurprisingly after Obama was elected, we saw a massive spike in gun sales. As one gun store owner put it shortly after Obama won, \u201cI have been in business for 12 years, and I was here for Y2K, September 11, Katrina... we did notice a spike in business, but nothing on the order of what we are seeing right now.\u201d\n\n\n\nNo mention at the NRA convention of the truth that every day 30 Americans are murdered by gun violence and 53 Americans uses guns to commit suicide.\n\nAnd the NRA\u2019s lies about Obama continued. For example, in 2011 the NRA claimed that Obama\u2019s \u201ctrue intention is to destroy the Second Amendment in our country.\u201d And during Obama\u2019s reelection campaign in 2012, the NRA sent out a fundraising letter that claimed Obama\u2019s re-election would result in the \u201cconfiscation of our firearms.\u201d\n\nDoes the NRA lie in an effort to help gun manufacturers sell firearms? After all, estimates are that gun manufactures have ponied up between$20 million and $50 million in contributions to the NRA since 2005. Or is it because the NRA needs an enemy to rally its supporters behind? Or a little of both?\n\nRegardless of the reason, the NRA is now pivoting from Obama to Hillary Clinton. LaPierre stated at this weekend\u2019s convention that Clinton \u201chas been coming after us for decades...Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t met a gun control bill that she couldn\u2019t support.\u201d\n\nLaPierre then warned, in Game of Thrones-esque terms, that \u201cHillary Rodham Clinton will bring a permanent darkness of deceit and despair forced upon the American people to endure.\u201d After hearing that, I almost want to buy a gun. And no doubt we can expect even more outlandish rhetoric and unabashed lies from LaPierre directed at Clinton as the 2016 race heats up.\n\nNot to be left out, Ted Cruz joined the fear mongering with his statement to the NRA attendees that \u201cif Hillary Clinton is going to join with Barack Obama and the gun grabbers and come after our guns, then what I say is come and take it.\u201d\n\nJust the concept of \u201cgun grabbing\u201d makes me laugh. After all, Congress couldn\u2019t even muster the votes needed in 2013 to pass universal background checks for gun purchasers and that had the support of 90 percent of Americans. And that bill failed only a few months after the horrific shooting spree at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 26 dead, including 20 children.\n\nThe reality is that while LaPierre and his cronies have been weaving fabulous tales of impeding gun grabbing, Republican-controlled state legislatures have been weakening gun safety laws. For example, just last year, Republicans in Georgia passed the \u201cguns everywhere bill\u201d that makes it legal to carry guns in bars, school zones, and parts of airports.

You\u2019d yowl at the victorious hippies, that\u2019s what.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, at the perimeter of the United States Capitol lawn, a small gathering of pink-shirted protesters held signs advertising their support for the Iran nuclear deal and sang \u201cGive Peace a Chance,\u201d the anti-war classic that has seemingly been a feature of every left-wing rally since the 1970s.\n\nJ.D.

The tragedy of being a right-wing activist in the age of Obama is that, despite the Tea Party successes of 2010 and 2014, you keep losing. Wednesday\u2019s rally was scheduled the day after the fate of the Iran deal was sealed, meaning that in order to avoid embarrassment, perhaps the only thing left to do for the Tea Party is yell \u201cshut the fuck up.\u201d\n\nBraun told me he flew to Washington from Los Angeles just to attend the rally, which was organized by the Tea Party Patriots and headlined by Cruz, Trump, and Sarah Palin. Braun said the trip was worth it if he could help demonstrate that there are real people\u2014people like him\u2014who believe the deal is a disaster for the United States.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want them to get $150 billion of taxpayer money,\u201d he said, referring to the frozen assets\u2014none of them owned by U.S. taxpayers\u2014that Iran may gain access to with sanctions relief, \u201cso they can buy conventional weapons, so they can develop nuclear weapons, so they can terrorize Israel and the rest of the Democratic free world.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody!

But in the end it looked like no more than a few hundred of them ventured out in the 93-degree heat. If Iran deal opponents were looking for a sign of a popular uprising, they certainly weren\u2019t going to find it here.\n\nThose who did show up were the Tea Party diehards, the sort of people who think nothing of driving a few hours or taking time out of the middle of a workday to help fight the good fight, be it against immigration reform, or against Obamacare, or against Planned Parenthood, or, Wednesday, against the Iran deal.

Trump has always been a draw for the Tea Party: His CPAC appearances during the Obama era, for example, have been attended in droves. But his position as the marquee name at Wednesday\u2019s rally suggests that the Trump movement has eclipsed the Tea Party in importance, and his appearance was more a favor than a required campaign stop.\n\nIn that sense, the event felt sort of like a throwback. Trump\u2019s role, though hyped, was minimal. His remarks were short and unsurprising. He talked, mostly, about himself. The most incredible moment of all the speeches was when Palin, dressed in a fuchsia linen jacket, said, \u201cOnly in an Orwellian Obama world full of sprinkly fairy dust floating from atop a unicorn as he\u2019s peeking through a pretty pink kaleidoscope would he ever see victory or safety for America or Israel in this treaty.\u201d\n\nIt is only in a similar world, coincidentally, that Wednesday\u2019s event is likely to have any impact at all on the Iran deal, which is already done.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:03.138+0000"}

But to regain traction, Clinton must connect with voters in the middle on growth, foreign policy, and health care.\n\nBrooklyn, we have a problem.\n\nLargely the result of her own doing, Hillary Clinton is mired in a candidacy-threatening scandal that could reshape the Democratic primary race in the short term and undermine her chances of getting the nomination in the long term.\n\nIt\u2019s not going to be enough just to simply say that other secretaries of state have used private email accounts. It will also not be enough to have spokesman after spokesman say that it was not against State Department regulations at the time she did it or that she didn\u2019t send any material that was classified at the time she sent or received it.\n\nClinton is also facing a continued decline in her poll numbers, with the new Quinnipiac survey showing that in hypothetical general election matchups with Trump, Bush, and Rubio, Vice President Joe Biden polls better than Clinton does. What\u2019s more, Biden has a 48 percent favorability rating as compared to 39 percent for Clinton. And while 76 percent of Democrats still approve of Clinton, there is no doubt that her campaign is facing a steep challenge.\n\nClinton would be wise to get ahead of a troubling trend as it relates to insurance company consolidation, which runs directly counter to the intent and promise of the ACA.\n\nWhat Clinton is going to need to do is to change the subject and develop a public policy agenda that goes beyond what she has said thus far, which is arguably nothing more than trying to move to the left to block Bernie Sanders\u2019s now seemingly inexorable rise nationally, and especially, in New Hampshire.\n\nThe first order of business is a centrist agenda that plays on the dissatisfaction that exists generally in America but to offer something more than redistribution, higher taxes, and a newfound anger at Wall Street. Let me be clear: There is nothing wrong with taking part of the Bernie Sanders/Elizabeth Warren agenda. But if that is the whole campaign message, it will inevitably fail as voters seek the real thing, not the light version.\n\nBeing all things to all people means that Clinton needs an all-inclusive broad agenda\u2014not a narrow agenda\u2014wherein she puts the emphasis on growth front and center. She needs to focus on integrating economic policies and tax policies that support and enhance growth, not simply supporting and enhancing redistribution of wealth.\n\nThe next president will be expected to get our economy back on a healthy and sustainable footing, with GDP growth, job creation, and re-integration of workers missing from the labor market as the core criteria for success. Prioritizing pro-growth trade that ensures protections for intellectual property and creates the necessary conditions for U.S. competitiveness are must-haves as the global economic picture remains highly uncertain. We saw how critical this is to Democrat voters during the Trans Pacific Partnership negotiations.\n\nThere needs to be a Clinton doctrine in foreign policy other then silent acquiescence to Obama\u2019s agenda. We need muscular militarism tailored to the concerns of voters, which is that we be smart and effective in using U.S. power and not necessarily counter our adversaries whether they be in Eastern or Central Europe, the Middle East, or elsewhere.\n\nWhen it comes to health care, Clinton needs to release a detailed plan for how she will go about amending the Affordable Care Act. Fortunately, there are a number of provisions that resonate with Democrats (as well as many Republicans), including restricting insurance companies from discriminating based upon pre-existing conditions and keeping kids on their parents\u2019 plan until their 26th birthday. State efforts to expand Medicaid\u2014while unpopular among Republicans\u2014will be broadly supported in a general election campaign. As will protecting successful programs like Medicare Part D that consistently earn over 85 percent satisfaction ratings in surveys.\n\nHowever, Clinton would be wise to get ahead of a troubling trend as it relates to insurance company consolidation, which runs directly counter to the intent and promise of the ACA. Increasingly, a number of growing concerns exist among Democrats and Republicans, including the ongoing likelihood of reduced marketplace competition, limited consumer choice, and the real probability that insurers could become so big that they\u2019re considered \u201ctoo big to fail.\u201d\n\nMore importantly, this evolved system threatens to pose daily difficulties to patients seeking care options (unfortunately, it is already happening en masse). While I\u2019ve long believed that the law is flawed, it did include \u201cPatient Protection\u201d as part of the name, and Democrats need to make it better, not worse. I also wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Sanders or a future left-leaning candidate begins to raise concerns about the administration\u2019s closeness with insurance providers, which will put Clinton on the defensive if she doesn\u2019t get in front of it.\n\nWhile necessary, focusing on public policy doesn\u2019t take away from the need for Clinton to provide a transparent and candid explanation of her decision to maintain a private email server as secretary of state. Assuming this happens, the next step will be to define a first-term agenda that wins over skeptical Democrats while laying the groundwork for a highly-contentious general election campaign.\n\nThe next few months will make or break Clinton\u2019s candidacy.

{"entityId": 1534, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Rubio will rise and Trump will inevitably fall. But if you look at the number of questions that were asked\u2014and the substance of those questions\u2014you\u2019ll see why.\n\nWell, that was kind of like watching a basketball game that had 10 teams. But hey\u2014the questions were good. They were surprisingly tough. But were they evenly tough? That\u2019s an interesting question. Let\u2019s take a quick look at who was asked what, among the four top candidates. I kept track.\n\nDonald Trump was asked eight questions, about: why he wouldn\u2019t back the GOP nominee (which he of course brought on himself by volunteering that he might not); all the names he\u2019s called women; what his evidence was for saying that Mexico is \u201csending\u201d us its rapists; why he used to support single-payer; his four bankruptcies; why he was once pro-choice; whether his tone is appropriate in a president; the Iran deal.\n\nJeb Bush was asked six questions, about: dynastic politics; his previous Iraq faux pas; Common Core; his 4 percent growth pledge; being on that Bloomberg board (an abortion question); did he call Trump a \u201cclown,\u201d \u201cbuffoon,\u201d or \u201casshole.\u201d\n\nThey didn\u2019t hit Rubio with any gotcha questions.\n\nScott Walker (seven questions): the Wisconsin abortion bill that makes no exception for the life of the mother; his path-to-citizenship flip-flop; what more we could be doing with our Mideast allies; Wisconsin\u2019s poor job growth; the Iran deal; police shootings; cyber war.\n\nMarco Rubio (six questions): lack of experience; immigration; Common Core; how he\u2019d help small businesses; what Megyn Kelly thought was his support for rape and incest exceptions for abortion; about God and veterans.\n\nLots of people seem to think that Rubio had a strong night. I would submit to you that the question list helps explain why. They lobbed a few massive softballs in his direction. For example, both he and Bush were asked about Common Core. But whereas to Bush this was a challenging question, because he\u2019s swimming against the GOP tide on the question, to Rubio it was just, as a Senator, what do you think of what Governor Bush just said? The immigration and small-business questions were totally teed up. And God and veterans? They might as well have asked him if he loved his mother (which he answered anyway; he does).\n\nThe other top-tier candidates all got tougher questions. Seven of Trump\u2019s eight questions could fairly be called confrontational or at least challenging. Five of Bush\u2019s six were the same; maybe all six. Three of Walker\u2019s seven. And just one or at most two of Rubio\u2019s. And even those were only mildly so. The lack-of-experience question, for example, was an obvious set-up for him to launch into his future shtick, which he plans on making his main line of attack against Hillary Clinton should he be the nominee.\n\nNow I\u2019m not suggesting that there\u2019s some Murdoch-orchestrated conspiracy here to elevate Rubio. Moderating a 10-candidate debate is probably a really hard thing to do. They surely drew up at least 20 questions for each candidate, knowing that they could only get to some of them, and of course they had to make sure that the questioning was evenly distributed. It\u2019s a high-pressure gig, and the three of them\u2014Kelly, Baier, and Wallace\u2014did pretty well overall.\n\nBut it is a fact that they didn\u2019t hit Rubio with any gotcha questions. Two possibilities spring to mind. They could have asked him about his hard-line Cuba position, which isn\u2019t supported even by Cubans in Florida themselves, except those aged 65 and older. And if they\u2019d really wanted to zing him, they could have brought up that hearing where he seemed to think that Iran and ISIS were allies and John Kerry had to explain politely that they weren\u2019t.\n\nIn contrast, it seemed clear that they wanted to rake Trump over the coals. The opening question, about whether they\u2019d all support the GOP nominee, was obviously aimed squarely at him, and he obliged them by affirming that no, he would not. Well, Trump\u2019s the front-runner, and the front-runner should get tough questions. And Trump was pretty bad. He clearly didn\u2019t prepare much, he wasn\u2019t funny (and he can be), and he didn\u2019t manage at all to do the one thing he really should have done, which was to say something, just one thing, that was substantive, that showed he had a surprising command of policy, so that the talking heads afterward would have been forced to say, \u201cHey, that Donald, give him credit, he showed us something new tonight.\u201d He showed nothing new.\n\nBush was\u2026okay. His task was to be the one who seized on any Trump stumble to communicate to people: See, I\u2019m the real front-runner. But he never really did that. Walker was kind of a blank until almost the very end of the debate, when he pulled out that line about how Russia knows more about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails than the United States Congress.\n\nAs for the second tier: John Kasich probably had the best night. At least he managed to get an audience of conservatives to applaud the fact that he attended a gay wedding. That\u2019s what a home-court advantage will do for you. But his saying that God\u2019s unconditional love for him meant he should love a potentially gay daughter was the right way to do it.\n\nAnd yes, I\u2019m kind of surprised that I\u2019m 860 words into this column and haven\u2019t mentioned Ted Cruz. Now there\u2019s a guy who needs a lot more than 60 seconds to find his rhythm.\n\nBottom line: Trump drops, Rubio gains. But the most interesting figure, even though he is personally quite boring, is Bush. When will he demonstrate that he actually deserves to be the one getting all these millions of dollars raised for him? He\u2019s just a bet by moneyed class, not because of what he is, but because of what he isn\u2019t (not Trump, not extremist).

{"entityId": 1535, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, the media is exaggerating Clinton\u2019s troubles. But that doesn\u2019t mean she needs a real shift in strategy.\n\nSo now it\u2019s almost fall, and now, thanks to the most recent State email release, we know that Hillary Clinton apparently still believes in appointment TV (she wanted to know what time The Good Wife and Parks and Recreation were on) and that Lanny Davis does not employ the light touch.\n\nAnd oh yeah, we know her campaign is in trouble. We know that because it\u2019s always in trouble. That\u2019s one of the chief rules of 2015-16 political journalism in America. Whatever it is, it\u2019s #badforHillary.\n\nIf she\u2019s in trouble, it\u2019s a trouble I\u2019d imagine every other candidate would crave being in. Consider, for example, the following question. Here is the RealClearPolitics page on presidential general election match-ups\u2014Clinton vs. Trump, Bush, Walker, Rubio, Kasich, Cruz, etc. It shows 40 different polls results pitting Clinton against 11 different GOP contenders. In how many of those 40 does Clinton trail her opponent?\n\nI\u2019ll give you the answer later. But for now, here\u2019s my assessment of Clinton Campaign Phase 1, as summer winds down. In policy terms, it\u2019s been surprisingly strong. As I\u2019ve written, she\u2019s been more progressive-populist on economics than I expected. Fine, she\u2019s not Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren, but in terms of middle-class economics questions, she\u2019s embraced positions that Barack Obama, John Kerry, Al Gore, and her husband wouldn\u2019t touch. She\u2019s ducked an issue or two, like trade, but she\u2019s gone farther faster than almost anyone expected.\n\nAs for the enthusiasm thing, it seems to be a real problem. I talk to relatives who are Democrats. Yes, they say, I\u2019ll vote for her, but I\u2019m not exactly pumped up about it.\n\nBut very few people are paying much attention to this, because Clinton has these other two problems that can\u2019t yet be overcome with policy substance. The first of course is the emails. The second is a real, though often overstated by the media, enthusiasm problem. In the out-year autumn Phase II of her campaign, she needs to start changing some people\u2019s minds on these two matters.\n\nThe email story has already damaged her, there\u2019s no doubt of that. She has one big chance to turn the story around this fall\u2014when she testifies before the House \u201cBenghazi\u201d committee in October. That committee, now empanelled longer than Frank Church\u2019s intelligence reform committee in the 1970s\u2014an actually important committee that found out actually important things\u2014isn\u2019t even pretending to be about the Benghazi attacks anymore. It\u2019s a taxpayer-funded get-Clinton operation, and it\u2019s now all about finding a smoking gun in these emails.\n\nIf Clinton handles her testimony well, she can get more Americans to see what a fraud the committee is. For the past couple of months, the committee has receded into the background. The email story looks to most people, even really informed ones, like a skirmish between the Clinton campaign and the Justice Department. Most people haven\u2019t the slightest idea that the committee set this process in motion. If the committee becomes the issue again, then the email story can become not solely \u201cHillary is shifty\u201d but something with two layers: \u201cOK, Hillary may be shifty, but those guys are using taxpayer money to conduct an obviously partisan dirt-digging operation, and that\u2019s worse.\u201d\n\nAs for the enthusiasm thing, it seems to be a real problem. I talk to relatives who are Democrats. Yes, they say, I\u2019ll vote for her, but I\u2019m not exactly pumped up about it.\n\nThis kind of thing sorts itself out over time. Once she gets into a general-election race (if she does) against whatever Republican, and the GOP is selling buttons of her riding a broomstick and paying for robocalls saying that she wants to send your children to political education camps and all that madness, rank-and-file Democrats will have her back.\n\nBut she can\u2019t wait that long. She\u2019s running against a guy who\u2019s drawing crowds of 15,000 and more, crowds that right now she quite frankly can\u2019t draw. What effect would three more months of that\u2014Bernie Sanders speaking at basketball arenas, Clinton speaking at events the size of PTA meetings\u2014have on perceptions and poll numbers?\n\nThe Clinton campaign needs to do something to create the sense that there is in fact enthusiasm for her out there in the land. There surely is. But who are these Clinton enthusiasts? I\u2019d say the campaign needs to find some of them, and obviously they can\u2019t be just baby boomer white women, and put them in some YouTube ads to show the media and the rest of the country that yes, there are in fact citizens out there who actually can\u2019t wait for her to take the oath of office, a subset of people that no one inside the Beltway believes exists.\n\nNow, back to my question. Out of 40 head-to-head polls against 11 Republican candidates, Clinton trails in exactly two. There\u2019s one Fox poll from mid-August where Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio each lead her by two points. But 38 other times, she\u2019s ahead, and usually not by especially close margins. She\u2019s +9 on John Kasich and +8.8 on Donald Trump and +4.7 on Scott Walker. Only Bush and Rubio are close. That seems to me a pretty enviable position for a floundering campaign to be in.\n\nNevertheless, she isn\u2019t where she could be or should be. And my two maladies are related. She screwed up this email business in the first place by not using a state.gov email address, and it just gives too many supporters that \u201cOy, here we go again\u201d feeling. She has to reassure Democrats that if she\u2019s president, she\u2019s going to be smarter and more careful than that.

It feels like it was yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were just kids,\u201d Mitchell smilingly agreed.\n\nSitting opposite each other in a studio done up to look like some garish real estate mogul\u2019s ostentatious living room, nearly swallowed up by humongous white chairs, they were so close together that their shoes occasionally touched.\n\nApparently these two women of the same generation know each other pretty well\u2014Mitchell covered Clinton at the State Department\u2014and not just on a professional basis. After all, Mitchell\u2019s husband is Alan Greenspan, who was chairman of the Federal Reserve during the Bill Clinton presidency and a frequently consulted economic policy adviser.\n\nSo the candidate seemed unfazed even when Mitchell was asking if she wished to \u201capologize to the American people\u201d for the email screw-up. (Not really; unless \u201cI am sorry this has been confusing to people\u201d constitutes an apology).\n\nShe did, of course, repeatedly express regret, in a seemingly more heartfelt manner than her earlier pro-forma expressions of regret, for making such a lousy\u2014and politically damaging\u2014choice concerning her electronic communications.\n\nOne listens to her Jesuitical contortions about what was permitted or not permitted, what was marked classified and what was not, or which of her predecessors did nearly the same thing, with growing numbness and boredom\u2014as good a strategy as any, perhaps Clinton believes, to get her past this controversy.\n\nThe one moment when Clinton really herniated my credulity was when Mitchell asked about the private server: \u201cDid anyone in your inner circle say, \u2018This isn\u2019t such a good idea. Let\u2019s not do this\u2019\u201d?\n\nAnd the candidate responded: \u201cYou know, I was not thinking a lot when I got in. There was so much work to be done. We had so many problems around the world. I didn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be? I just didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nTo state the obvious, if Secretary of State Clinton actually hadn\u2019t given any thought to her emailing methods, then she would have done the easiest thing and used her government account. What\u2019s more, it is simply hard to believe that this image-parsing, outwardly scrupulous public official\u2014a self-described \u201cpolicy wonk\u201d who never saw a heap of details she didn\u2019t dive into\u2014\u201cdidn\u2019t really stop and think what kind of email system will there be.\u201d\n\nThat said, Clinton clearly appreciated that the barrage of email questions\u2014including her scheduled October 22 appearance (\u201cgrueling,\u201d as she expects it to be) before the Republican-run House committee investigating Benghazi and other missteps\u2014constitutes a door she must walk through, however painfully, in order to arrive at the White House.\n\nClinton took every opportunity to pivot to her core issues such as income inequality and championing the middle class. Although we are supposedly in the midst of an election cycle in which pissed-off voters are resonating to candidates who channel populist rage but otherwise don\u2019t seem to know a whole lot about much of anything, some might ultimately find Clinton\u2019s calculated and policy-heavy rhetoric reassuring if not particularly exciting.\n\nHer attempts to humanize herself\u2014playing along with a \u201clightning round\u201d in which she complained of sleep deprivation, admitted to a yen for chocolate, and revealed that she prefers, yes, emailing to texting\u2014seemed a tad contrived, though the contrivance was Mitchell\u2019s, not Clinton\u2019s.\n\nWhen Mitchell asked about Donald Trump, and his attacks on Clinton\u2019s closest aide, Huma Abedin, the candidate replied: \u201cWell, he\u2019s attacked so many people\u2026From great basketball players to people who express different opinions from him. I think it\u2019s an unfortunate development in American politics\u2014that his campaign is all about who he\u2019s against, whether it\u2019s immigrants or women broadcasters or aides of other candidates.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI also believe the president of the United States does have to be careful about what he or she says. You know, I do know sometimes people say, well, I\u2019m careful about what I say. That\u2019s because for more than 20 years I\u2019ve seen the importance of the president of the United States, the leader not only of our nation, but of the world, having to send messages that will be received by all kinds of people. Loose talk, threats, insults\u2014they have consequences. So I\u2019m going to conduct myself as I believe is appropriate for someone seeking the highest office in our country.\u201d\n\nThat was one of Clinton\u2019s better moments.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:04.553+0000"}

In a statement sent from his management, Young noted his displeasure, adding that, while a Canadian citizen, he supported Bernie Sanders for U.S. president.\n\nWhile headline grabbing as much because of the size of the, um, personalities, of the two eccentric celebrities involved, this is just the latest in a long, not-so-proud history of politicians appropriating music for their campaigns, copyright laws of the land they seek to serve be damned.\n\nMusic can, of course, set the tone for a victorious stump speech, and has been emplyed with great efficacy by everyone from George Washington, who used \u201cGod Save Great Washington,\u201d a parody of \u201cGod Save the King,\u201d to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cHappy Days Are Here Again\u201d and Barack Obama, who celebrated victory in 2012 with Stevie Wonders\u2019 \u201cSigned, Sealed, Delivered.\u201d But in order for any sort of commercial use, and campaigns are commercial use, music must be licensed from the song\u2019s publisher, who will determine usage rights and costs. Failure to do so can result in everything from being sued, such as when former Florida Governor Charlie Crist was slapped with a million-dollar lawsuit by Talking Heads front man David Byrne for a campaign ad featuring the band\u2019s \u201cRoad to Nowhere\u201d \u2014they settled out of court, and Crist published an apology via YouTube\u2014to public chastisement from the offended artist, like this tweet from the Dropkick Murphys to Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker:\n\nThe upside to famous musicians publicly taking offense at pols using their music, of course, is that it generates press, and often lots of it. As we all know, any publicity is good publicity. Better to be lambasted by a bunch of surly punk rockers than have to actually engage in a thoughtful debate with your opponents. Here are a few more sonic scofflaws:\n\nNewt Gingrich, who used Survivor\u2019s \u201cEye of the Tiger\u201d without permission during his 2012 campaign found himself in a court battle, which he viciously contested and ultimately wound up settling. Fellow Republican presidential wannabe John McCain is no stranger to the court of intellectual property either, having been taken there by legendarily liberal Jackson Browne for using \u201cRunning on Empty\u201d in commercials. McCain was also asked to stop using John Mellencamp\u2019s \u201cPink Houses\u201d and \u201cOur Country,\u201d as well as the Foo Fighter\u2019s \u201cMy Hero.\u201d The Foo Fighters responded with a statement:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating and infuriating that someone who claims to speak for the American people would repeatedly show such little respect for creativity and intellectual property.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rotten apple doesn\u2019t fall far from the tree: McCain running mate Sarah Palin found herself on blast from the Wilson sisters after illegitimately using their band Heart\u2019s \u201cBarracuda.\u201d\n\nMichele Bachmann was delivered a cease and desist from Tom Petty for her use of \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d which she proceeded to temporarily ignore. She then went on to play Katrina and the Waves\u2019 \u201cWalking on Sunshine\u201d instead, prompting the \u201980s rockers to join with Petty against her. This wasn\u2019t a first-time fight for Petty, whose \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down\u201d was blared by George W. Bush during his 2000 run.\n\nThe list goes on: pro politico/amateur bassist Mike Huckabee got himself in some trouble for just performing Boston\u2019s \u201cMore Than a Feeling\u201d at tour stops, occasionally even with former Boston guitarist Barry Goudreau, eliciting a heartfelt \u201cfuck you\u201d from the band\u2019s ringleader, and staunch Obama supporter, Tom Scholz. Decidedly not progressive Rand Paul ran afoul of Canadian prog rockers Rush when he played their music during his campaign, and just this year raver Republican Marco Rubio bummed out EDM artists Axwell and Ingrosso after playing their \u201cSomething New\u201d at his presidential campaign kickoff party.\n\nTwisted Sister\u2019s Dee Snider wouldn\u2019t take it when then-GOP VP candidate Paul Ryan played their hit \u201cWe\u2019re Not Gonna Take It,\u201d and who can forget Bob Dole\u2019s parody of Sam & Dave\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m a Soul Man,\u201d the regrettable \u201cI\u2019m a Dole Man?\u201d Even further back, Ronald Reagan ran afoul of Bruce Springsteen, for his brazen use of \u201cBorn in the USA\u201d without getting The Boss\u2019s green light.\n\nIt\u2019s not just the GOP, either. Barack Obama was asked by Sam Moore of Sam & Dave to stop using the duo\u2019s \u201cHold On, I\u2019m Coming\u201d in his run, and Cyndi Lauper took issue with the Democrat\u2019s campaign use of her song, \u201cTrue Colors,\u201d against McCain, even though she was an Obama supporter.\n\nOf course, in these days of extremism and nonpartisanship, even saying you like a band can lead to public shaming: when then-Republican VP hopeful Paul Ryan copped to liking politically charged rock band Rage Against the Machine, the band\u2019s guitarist, and devoted social justice activist, Tom Morello, responded with a scathing op-ed in Rolling Stone, saying:\n\n\u201cI clearly see that Ryan has a whole lotta \u2018rage\u2019 in him: A rage against women, a rage against immigrants, a rage against workers, a rage against gays, a rage against the poor, a rage against the environment. Basically the only thing he\u2019s not raging against is the privileged elite he\u2019s groveling in front of for campaign contributions.\u201d\n\nOuch.\n\nAs we careen into 2016, there\u2019s sure to be plenty more infractions to add.

The company pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal information in 2010. In its plea agreement with the Department of Justice, Balli Aviation agreed to pay a $2 million criminal fine, serve five years of corporate probation, and pay an additional $15 million in civil fines. The hefty sum was \u201ca direct consequence of the level of deception used to mislead investigators,\" Thomas Madigan, a top Justice Department official, said at the time.\n\nAlaghband is one of an array of questionable actors who\u2019ve been found in recent months to have given to the Clinton Foundation. The gifts\u2014from foreign governments with human-rights violations like Qatar, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, and China, as well as FIFA, soccer\u2019s corrupt governing body\u2014have complicated Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for president and raised questions as to whether these entities were trying to curry favor with the former Secretary of State.\n\nBut Alaghband stands out from the rest, because the beneficiary of his firm\u2019s deals with Tehran was an Iranian airline accused by the U.S. government of working with the regime\u2019s foreign intelligence operatives and shipping arms and troops to Syria. Plus, if an agreement between Iran and the world\u2019s major powers is concluded in the coming days\u2014as is widely expected\u2014operators like Alaghband could stand to benefit. Hillary Clinton will be put in the awkward position of either defending the act of the Obama administration in which she once served or criticizing the culmination of a U.S.-Iran rapprochement effort, which her State Department began.\n\nOne of the two counts against Balli Aviation was that it \u201cconspired to export three Boeing 747 aircraft from the United States to Iran,\u201d according to a Justice Department statement, without first obtaining the necessary export licenses from the U.S. government. The company then used its Armenian airline subsidiary to buy the 747s with financing obtained from Mahan Air, Iran\u2019s largest private airline, which is thought by the State Department to be controlled by former Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.\n\n\n\nIn 2011, the Treasury Department sanctioned the airline for \u201cproviding financial, material and technological support to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods Force (IRGC-QF),\u201d or the expeditionary arm of the Islamic Republic's praetorian military division, now heavily active in both Syria and Iraq. At the time, the Treasury Department accused the Qods Force of \u201csecretly ferrying operatives, weapons and funds\u201d on Mahan flights.\n\nOn the Clinton Foundation website, Alaghband\u2019s company is listed as a donor in the $10,001 to $25,000 bracket. Moreover, on the website for Balli Real Estate, a property investment and development subsidiary also based in the UK, his personal bio describes him as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nThis affiliation, along with his donation to the Foundation, came as a surprise to Alaghband.\n\n\u201cI am not a member of the Clinton Global Initiative,\u201d he told The Daily Beast from London. \u201cI attended a few meetings. The last meeting was 10 years ago. I don\u2019t recall having ever made a contribution.\u201d Asked why he was listed as a member of the CGI on his own corporate website, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this website recently. If attending a few meetings makes you a member, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA source familiar with the Clinton Foundation told The Daily Beast that \u201cVahid Alaghband was never a member of CGI in a personal capacity.\u201d However, the source added, \u201cIn 2007, Balli Group paid a onetime CGI membership fee and they designated him as their delegate to the meeting.\u201d\n\nAlaghband did recall giving money to another influential organization\u2014the Washington, D.C.-based think tank the Brookings Institution. The donation he gave was to Brookings\u2019 former Middle East policy shop, the Saban Center, which had been named for its major benefactor, the Israeli billionaire Haim Saban. (Staunchly pro-Israel, Saban is also, coincidentally, an avowed supporter of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential ambitions.)\n\nIn 2007, Alaghband offered to give a $900,000 donation to run for three years to Brookings via the U.S.-based PARSA Foundation, \u201cthe first Persian community foundation in the U.S. and the leading Persian philanthropic institution practicing strategic philanthropy and promoting social entrepreneurship around the globe,\u201d as the foundation\u2019s website describes it.\n\nEmails obtained in the discovery process of a separate libel case show that Alaghband, who had already donated at least $50,000 to PARSA, initially intended to make a pass-through donation via the foundation to Brookings.\n\nBut Alaghband says that he never ultimately used PARSA as a conduit for his donation; instead, he made his contribution directly to the Saban Center. He says the amount given was \u201cfar less\u201d than $900,000 but declined to specify how much. Furthermore, he insisted, the money wasn\u2019t earmarked for any specific project or research use. \u201cOur donation went to the Saban Center and they had full discretion as to what to do with it,\u201d Alaghband said. \u201cMartin Indyk had discretion over the use of the funds.\u201d\n\nIndyk, who headed the Saban Center from 2002 to 2013, is today the vice president and director for foreign policy at Brookings. He also served\u2014 twice\u2014as U.S. ambassador to Israel under the Clinton administration. In 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry named Indyk the U.S. envoy to the Middle East.\n\n\u201cWhen we took the donation nobody knew there were any problems with Alaghband,\u201d David Nassar, the vice president of communications for Brookings, told The Daily Beast, speaking on behalf of the think tank. Nassar also specified that the donation came from Balli Group bank accounts, not from Alaghband\u2019s personal accounts. (Full disclosure: Daily Beast Executive Editor Noah Shachtman previously did work as a non-resident fellow in Brookings\u2019 foreign policy division.)\n\nAsked why he was listed as a member of the Clinton Global Initiative on his own corporate website, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this website recently.\u201d\n\nA former Brookings staffer with direct knowledge of the donation told The Daily Beast that, on the contrary, Alaghband\u2019s problems with the U.S. government were known to the think tank at the time and that the money helped finance the work of Suzanne Maloney, a former State Department policy adviser and Republican advocate of U.S.-Iranian rapprochement.\n\n\n\nNassar told The Daily Beast that the suggestion that Alaghband\u2019s donation was intended to bolster Maloney\u2019s pro-rapprochement research was false. \u201cThe money was general funding for the Persian Gulf Initiative and not directed at any particular issue or any particular scholar,\u201d he said. Nevertheless, the Persian Gulf Initiative was a program run by the Saban Center and Maloney worked on it.\n\n\n\nMaloney is married to Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar who served in the Obama White House in 2009 and who, during that period, was one of the lead advocates of engagement with Tehran.\n\nSince leaving the administration, Takeyh has emerged as a scathing critic of his former employer\u2019s nuclear diplomacy. But in 2008, Maloney and Takeyh jointly published a 34-page white paper with the Saban Center titled, \u201cPathway to Coexistence: A New U.S. Policy toward Iran.\u201d Arguing that the long-standing U.S. policy of containment \u201cis actually obsolete because Iran is no longer an expansionist power,\u201d they called not for a mere \u201cpolicy shift but for a paradigm change\u201d in Washington.\n\nIn many ways, the paper essentially forecasted the Obama administration\u2019s approach to dealing with Iran, from the largely hands-off approach to Iran\u2019s bloody 2009 Green Revolution to the present-day compromises on its nuclear program.\n\nAlaghband\u2019s legal troubles did not appear to affect his relationship with Brookings a year after Balli Aviation was hit by the U.S. Commerce Department with a temporary ban on his Iranian export business. In February 2009, he spoke at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum in Doha, where Brookings has another Middle East center, this one bankrolled by the Qatari government. The forum, in fact, was organized by the Saban Center on behalf of that government.\n\nAlaghband, for his part, insists that he did nothing wrong, despite his company\u2019s guilty plea.\n\n\u201cThe settlement [with the Justice Department] was one under which we did not have to accept liability. We just agreed to make a payment and settle out of court,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe had to establish a compliance program and do all of those things. The transactions we were engaged in was reviewed by and subject to a legal to a legal opinion both in the UK and U.S. about the compliance of with sanctions. We proceeded on this basis.\u201d\n\nThe settlement also represented the largest civil penalty ever imposed by the Commerce Department\u2019s Bureau of Industry and Security.\n\nPARSA\u2019s second-largest recipient of grants is the National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a Washington, D.C.-based lobby group close to the Iranian regime, which advocates an end to all U.S. sanctions on Iran. It received a total of $591,500 from the foundation. Alaghband\u2019s brother, Hassan Alaghband, who is also the CEO of the Balli Group, spoke at a conference organized in Tehran by one of NIAC's founders in June 2007, at which he spoke about Western companies doing business in Iran and cited Balli\u2019s client, Caterpillar, as a case study.\n\nThe Balli Group PLC had once been the world\u2019s second-largest steel trader but it declared bankruptcy in 2013. A major reason for its folding? U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\n-- with additional reporting by Jackie Kucinich", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:05.681+0000"}

His campaign events are overwhelmingly white, and his own advisers have conceded\u2014and he himself has acknowledged\u2014that he is still a virtual unknown among African-American voters.\n\n\u201cBasically, the Bernie Sanders campaign has a lot of groundwork to do with regards to building the relationship with black voters,\u201d Terrell Starr, a senior editor at Alternet, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThere is still privilege with how white progressives view progressive politics with regards to racial discrimination\u2026And what we saw [Saturday] was an example of that disconnect.\u201d\n\nBlack Twitter went after the senator after his Netroots appearance:\n\n(It\u2019s true: Sanders marched with Martin Luther King Jr. in 1963 and was also arrested for protesting in favor of desegregating public schools in Chicago.)\n\nThat @AngryBlackLady tweet, sent out to her 35,000 followers, inspired Roderick Morrow\u2014who runs the \u201cBlack Guy Who Tips\u201d comedy podcast with his wife, Karen\u2014to launch the mocking hashtag #BernieSoBlack:\n\n#BernieSoBlack quickly began trending on Twitter:\n\nMorrow, who goes by @rodimusprime on Twitter and has more than 11,000 followers, said he was surprised his impromptu hashtag suddenly took off. \u201cI just thought it was a funny joke!\u201d he told The Daily Beast. But he added that his lighthearted jab was rooted in a serious concern about Sanders\u2019s candidacy.\n\n\u201cNot to disrespect what he did with Martin Luther King, but if you want to connect with black voters, they need to know what you are going to do now and going forward, not what you\u2019ve done in the past.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time race is brought up, he pivots to the economy, which obviously a lot of racial disparity comes via economic means, but some of it is just flat out racism and discrimination,\u201d Morrow said. Sanders\u2019s view that \u201cif we had more jobs in Ferguson, this wouldn\u2019t have happened, I\u2019m not sure that is valid. I mean, Mike Brown was on his way to college. It\u2019s not just a jobs thing.\u201d\n\nThe Sanders backlash could indicate friction and dissonance between two critical components of the Democratic base: white liberals and African-Americans.

{"entityId": 1540, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Denying that marital rape was illegal was just the start for Michael Cohen, Donald Trump\u2019s ultra-aggressive legal \u2018pit bull.\u2019\n\nPresidential candidate Donald Trump\u2019s sometimes-spokesman and special counsel Michael Cohen earned his \u201cpit bull\u201d moniker this week, when he attempted to intimidate a Daily Beast reporter\u2014and claimed that marital rape was a perfectly legal act.\n\nBut those were hardly Cohen\u2019s only revolting comments, or his only attempts at bullying. The Trump confidant also bragged to The Daily Beast about how he \u201cdestroy[ed]\u201d the life of a young beauty queen\u2014a woman Cohen called an \u201cidiot.\u201d\n\nThe ultra-aggressive tactics of Trump and his inner circle have raised questions about the GOP front-runner\u2019s character and judgment. Fellow Republican candidate Rick Perry called on Trump to drop out of the race after he questioned the heroism of former prisoner of war Senator John McCain. The Democratic National Committee chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, called Cohen\u2019s comments \u201cdespicable,\u201d adding, \u201cThis is a new low. Rape is rape. Full stop. End of story.\u201d\n\n\n\nTeam Trump\u2019s attitude towards female opponents has, at times, been particularly hostile. Legal papers revealed by The New York Times this week showed that Trump called a female attorney\u2014and new mother\u2014\u201cdisgusting\u201d after she took out her breast pump and said she needed to take a break from their deposition. On Wednesday, Trump doubled down on the remarks, calling the lawyer a \u201cvicious, horrible person.\u201d\n\nUntil Tuesday, when Donald Trump distanced himself from Cohen following his inaccurate remarks about spousal rape in The Daily Beast, the former Democrat had been one of his boss\u2019s most vocal public supporters, appearing on cable news shows to act as a surrogate for Trump and defend the campaign against the real estate mogul\u2019s more controversial claims including that Mexicans crossing the border are murderers and rapists and the insinuation that Senator John McCain\u2019s five years in captivity during the Vietnam War made him less of a hero.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s speaking for himself. He\u2019s not speaking for me, obviously,\u201d Trump said of Cohen on CNN.\n\nA campaign manager offered further clarification: \u201cMichael Cohen is a corporate employee and is not affiliated with the campaign in any way.\u201d\n\nThough threatening perceived enemies with lawsuits is a go-to response for Trump\u2014the plutocrat is particularly rankled by claims he is less wealthy than he claims to be\u2014the 2016 Republican front-runner often makes good. To prove his point during the call, Cohen invoked what he claimed were successful suits past like the recent $500 million suit against Spanish-language TV channel Univision after it decided not to air the Miss USA pageant following Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks about Mexican immigrants. But it\u2019s Trump\u2019s win over a beauty pageant contestant that Cohen seems to relish most.\n\n\u201cDo you want to destroy your life? It\u2019s going to be my privilege to serve it to you on a silver platter like I did that idiot from Pennsylvania in Miss USA, because I think you\u2019re dumber than she is,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSheena Monnin, another one that wanted to defame Mr. Trump and ended up with a $5 million judgment. That\u2019s going to be nothing compared to what I do to you.\u201d\n\nSheena Monnin\u2019s father, Philip Monnin, told The Daily Beast that Cohen treated her with \u201carrogance and bullying and threats and intimidation\u2026delivered with basic impunity.\u201d The 30-year-old former Miss Pennsylvania (Favorite song: \u201cMemory\u201d from the musical Cats; Hobbies: geology and studying rock formations) resigned her title in 2012 after failing to make the top 16 in the national pageant. She was subsequently hit with a $5 million defamation penalty in arbitration for questioning the integrity of the pageant\u2019s results.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s their right that they can do this and treat people this way,\u201d Philip Monnin said.\n\nNeither Cohen nor the Trump campaign responded to requests for comment for this article.\n\n\u201cDo you want to destroy your life? It\u2019s going to be my privilege to serve it to you on a silver platter like I did that idiot from Pennsylvania in Miss USA, because I think you\u2019re dumber than she is.\u201d\n\nPhilip Monnin said that his daughter reached a settlement with the Miss USA organization in 2014 and no longer speaks publicly about the lawsuit. (She may be barred from speaking by a gag order.)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s fine. She\u2019s moved on with her life. She\u2019s not had to rescind what she said,\u201d he added.\n\nCourt records show the judgment against Monnin was satisfied in August 2014.\n\nWhat she said was this: While backstage at rehearsal for the Miss USA pageant, another contestant told her she had seen a list of the top five finalists. When those five names were indeed called, she said she knew the competition had been rigged from the start.\n\nSo Monnin resigned her title and took to Facebook, posting in part: \u201cIn good conscience I can no longer be affiliated in any way with an organization I consider to be fraudulent, lacking in morals, inconsistent, and in many ways trashy.\u201d\n\nIn an email, Monnin cited the organization\u2019s recent decision to allow transgender women to compete as a reason for her resignation.\n\nTrump responded quickly, appearing on Good Morning America to announce his intent to sue the ex-beauty queen and lobbing an insult for good measure: \u201cShe lost and she\u2019s angry about losing. And frankly, in my opinion, I saw her barely a second and she didn\u2019t deserve to be in the top 15.\u201d\n\nMichael Cohen called into TMZ to give her a public ultimatum: Apologize and retract her claim that the pageant results were predetermined, or face a defamation lawsuit seeking \u201cmassive damages.\u201d\n\nHe gave her 24 hours. When asked by host Harvey Levin about the size of the intended lawsuit (\u201cHow much money are you gonna get from somebody who works at the Sunglass Hut?\u201d) Cohen said, \u201cIt\u2019s not about the money. You understand that. You understand Mr. Trump.\u201d\n\nBecause Monnin had signed a hefty contract with the Miss Universe Organization, the case was argued at arbitration. And because Monnin\u2019s lawyer was particularly terrible, according to a malpractice suit filed by Monnin and supported by a federal judge who later called his representation \u201cunconscionable,\u201d no one was there to defend her against Trump\u2019s main allegation: that her Facebook rants had caused the pageant to lose a $5 million sponsorship deal with BP and that young women who Googled Miss USA would see Miss Monnin\u2019s claims and not enter the competition, thinking that they didn\u2019t stand a chance.\n\nIn her request to have the $5 million award vacated, Monnin asked the court \u201cPlease do not enter a judgment that will financially devastate me for the rest of my life based on this record.\u201d Monnin later filed a malpractice claim against her attorney; a settlement from it helped her negotiate an end to her legal ordeal with Trump for a reported $1 million.\n\nAs Monnin\u2019s representative before she had legal counsel, her father spoke with Cohen twice over the phone in 2013. \u201cDuring our conversation there were threats and innuendo about what he would do to ruin her financially. For the rest of her life, he said she wouldn\u2019t be able to buy a car or have a credit card,\u201d Philip Monnin said.\n\nCohen appealed to her father to have Sheena Monnin delete all references to Trump or the pageant from her Facebook. The arbitration judge had refused to compel Monnin to remove the posts as part of the judgment against her.\n\n\u201cThey wanted to shut her down,\u201d Philip Monnin said.\n\nBut even in the face of a $5 million judgment, Monnin would not relent.\n\n\u201cAt first, he was not yelling,\u201d Philip Monnin said. But when he later called Cohen to relay her message, he said Cohen \u201cgot very angry.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe threw a fit on the phone,\u201d Philip Monnin said. \u201cHe basically said if I went along with my daughter I was an idiot. And said that she should apologize and if she didn\u2019t want to, then \u2018Game on,\u2019 and he slammed the phone down. And that was the end of the conversation.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure if you check other people who have had to deal with him, you\u2019d hear the same. Just bullying tactics and intimidation.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Cohen himself explained the meaning behind his nickname, Trump\u2019s \u201cpit bull,\u201d in a 2011 interview with ABC News.\n\n\u201cIt means that if somebody does something Mr. Trump doesn\u2019t like, I do everything in my power to resolve it to Mr. Trump\u2019s benefit,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cIf you do something wrong, I\u2019m going to come at you, grab you by the neck and I\u2019m not going to let you go until I\u2019m finished.\u201d\n\nThat attitude was on display when Cohen spoke with The Daily Beast. \u201cI will make sure that you and I meet one day while we\u2019re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don\u2019t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know,\u201d Cohen told The Daily Beast reporter who reached out to the campaign for comment over ex-wife Ivana Trump\u2019s 1993 deposed assertion that she had been \u201craped\u201d by her then-husband, allegations she later softened in a statement in which she asked her comments not to be interpreted \u201cin a literal or criminal sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I\u2019m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAnd that \u201cgrab you by the neck\u201d ethos was also demonstrated when Cohen tangled with the Monnin family.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unsettling,\u201d Philip Monnin said. \u201cBecause you\u2019re up against someone with a lot of funds to carry out their threats. And most people don\u2019t even have the funds to defend themselves against nonsense.\u201d\n\nThough Cohen boasted that his legal prowess had poisoned the future of Monnin\u2014a model and entrepreneur with degrees in human service and psychology\u2014a federal court attributed Trump\u2019s win to her \u201cpoor choice of counsel\u201d and noted neither \u201csympathy, or apparent inequity,\u201d was enough to overturn the \u201cdevastating monetary award.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe gave Sheena some challenges, but he did not destroy her life,\u201d Philip Monnin said. \u201cHe can brag that he did, but she\u2019s not an idiot from Pennsylvania, she\u2019s a very intelligent young lady.

{"entityId": 1541, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Jeb and Rubio are beating Hillary in the polls\u2014so why is the GOP so enthralled with guys like Trump and Carson?\n\nPresidential primaries are sometimes likened to dating; candidates try to woo voters, courting them, promising them the world, and then asking for their hand.\n\nIn the last two presidential elections, Republicans have dated around, seeing everyone from Rudy Giuliani to Herman Cain. But after a few summer flings, they\u2019ve always landed on the Very Nice And Responsible Choice.\n\nSo after having their hearts broken by John McCain and Mitt Romney, two candidates who promised \u201celectability\u201d and came up short, Republican primary voters may be ready to elope with the one their parents approve of least: Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nOr if not Trump, Ben Carson or Ted Cruz, two other candidates who are now sitting near the top of the GOP field but who political prognosticators expect would perform considerably less well against the Democratic nominee next November.\n\nYes, summer is often a silly time in a Republican primary, and the eventual nominees\u2014who seem inevitable in hindsight\u2014all had scares and moments buried in the pack.\n\nIn August 2007, Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson sat atop the GOP field; John McCain polled at a measly 7 percent. While Mitt Romney didn\u2019t have as terrible a summer in 2011, he was drowned out by Rick Perry for much of August and September and would later have to contend with a carousel of rising and falling opponents on his way to the nomination.\n\nBut the as far as summer flings go, the Summer of Trump takes the cake.\n\nRepublicans may have needed an \u201celectable\u201d candidate to beat the formidable political talent of Barack Obama, but to take on Hillary Clinton, maybe they think an out-there reality TV star and tabloid fixture could actually do the trick.\n\nThat\u2019s because, four years ago, electability really mattered to Republicans. Despite the rotating cast of characters on the upswing in the GOP race in 2011, Republican voters told Gallup that they preferred \u201csomeone who can beat Obama\u201d (50 percent) to \u201ca candidate who agrees\u201d with them on most issues (46 percent). Even more stunning, the Gallup data showed it was conservatives who were more focused on electability than were moderate and liberal Republicans (though presumably those moderates felt electability and their own views went hand in hand).\n\nToday, it isn\u2019t clear that electability matters all that much, or rather, that the definition of \u201celectability\u201d has changed.\n\nFirst, fewer voters today suggest that a candidate\u2019s ability to defeat the Democratic nominee is a major factor: Only 13 percent told the latest Fox News poll that they thought the ability to win in November 2016 was the most important factor in their choice. Strong leadership (29 percent) and conservative values (20 percent) topped the list. (Though, memo to Ted Cruz, \u201cWould shake things up in Washington\u201d also came in at only 13 percent.)\n\n\n\nNo doubt this is because, after having heard electability arguments in the last two presidential elections, Republicans have only seen \u201celectable\u201d candidates not get elected.\n\nFurthermore, though Hillary Clinton enjoys huge disdain from Republicans, perhaps Republicans are slightly less terrified by the specter of a Hillary Clinton presidency and don\u2019t view losing to her as being catastrophic\u2014a theory that seems crazy until you see that, in late 2014, polling showed Republicans liked her very slightly more than Barack Obama.\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s not the most bizarre explanation for the data. No, it is possible instead that the email scandals and her lackluster performance on the campaign trail have made her seem more vulnerable. Republicans may have needed an \u201celectable\u201d candidate to beat the formidable political talent of Barack Obama, but to take on Hillary Clinton, maybe they think an out-there reality TV star and tabloid fixture could actually do the trick.\n\nThe idea that Donald Trump actually is viewed as electable will strike most political pundits as insane. Yet \u201celectability\u201d may not only matter less\u2014it may have also been radically redefined after the respectable, responsible candidates failed to get the job done.\n\nThe most recent CNN poll asked Republicans to say which candidate best represented their values. Atop the pack? Ben Carson at 14 percent, followed by Donald Trump at 12 percent, Mike Huckabee at 11 percent and Ted Cruz at 10 percent.\n\n\n\nBut on the question of who \u201chas the best chance of winning in the general election?\u201d Trump actually increases to 22 percent, while Carson, Cruz, and Huckabee all fall out of the top tier, replaced by Jeb Bush (16 percent), Scott Walker (11 percent), and Marco Rubio (9 percent). Republican voters may be aware of Trump\u2019s apostasy on things like single-payer health care yet still think he\u2019s the guy with the big, terrific, huge plan to take out Hillary Clinton next year.\n\nSo what should make Republican leaders nervous isn\u2019t that voters are experimenting with a rebellious choice: It might be that they also genuinely think he\u2019s electable, too.\n\nPolls confirm that, at the moment, candidates like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush fare well against Hillary Clinton in matchups. But with the latest Fox News poll showing Trump down only five points to Clinton, these Trump-is-electable folks couldn\u2019t possibly be right, could they?\n\nAgainst a weakened Hillary Clinton, perhaps Republicans think just about anyone is electable\u2026 even Donald Trump.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:06.455+0000"}

Surprisingly, despite years of buildup, even key Clintonites admit \u201cthey need to reintroduce Hillary to America.\u201d If Bill Clinton were running for the third term he wishes he could seek, he would need little reframing. The Bill Clinton of 1992 mostly remains the same roguish, raffish, sophisticated, seductive politician and visionary we see\u2014and many miss\u2014today. But, as \u201cHillaryland\u201d contemplates yet another Hillary makeover, her earlier incarnations reveal why she has needed nine political lives\u2014and counting.\n\nIn going from a 1960s\u2019 Goldwater Girl to America\u2019s first serious female presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton has embodied the sexual revolution\u2019s cultural, political, and social upheavals. Attitudes about women\u2019s roles have clashed repeatedly and changed dramatically. In Living History\u2014her White House memoir\u2014Clinton has made Hard Choices\u2014her State Department memoir\u2014regarding policy matters, her own identity journey, and her search for an appealing image.\n\n\n\nThe feminist scholar Cheryl Van Daalen-Smith laments that women feel compelled to be like chameleons, \u201cother-defined not self-defined.\u201d As the ultimate political wife turned career politician, Hillary Rodham Clinton has needed to be \u201cultra-adaptive,\u201d and it shows.\n\nAlmost since her birth in 1947, to Hugh and Dorothy Rodham, Hillary Rodham Clinton has confronted the modern woman\u2019s dilemma: how to find feminine fulfillment while thriving as an equal in what remains a man\u2019s world. Raised in her Father Knows Best family in suburban Park Ridge, Illinois, supporting Barry Goldwater\u2019s 1964 candidacy made perfect sense.\n\nAs The Beatles and The Mod Squad eclipsed Ozzie and Harriet, her Methodist upbringing\u2014and her youth minister Donald Jones\u2014opened her to the hip call for \u201cservice.\u201d Attending Wellesley College from 1965 to 1969, Hillary Rodham embraced the counterculture\u2019s ideals more than its vices. Enrolling in Yale Law School, she chose reform over revolution and a nice career path too.\n\n\u201cOn her deathbed she wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phoney makeovers to please others.\u201d\n\nAt Yale, Hillary met Bill Clinton and volunteered with him on George McGovern\u2019s 1972 \u201cAcid, Amnesty, and Abortion\u201d presidential campaign. Labeled Sister Frigidaire in high school, she loved \u201cElvis\u201d Clinton\u2019s people smarts. Tired of Southern beauty queens, he loved her intellect. Since 1975, the two have had a rollercoaster marriage but a solid political partnership.\n\nIn moving to Fayetteville, Arkansas, Hillary chose Clinton over a conventional career. This Goldwater Girl turned McGovernik endured great frustration as Arkansas\u2019s First Lady during 12 long years in the statehouse. After Bill lost his first re-election bid in 1980, with voters muttering about \u201cthat feminist in the governor\u2019s mansion,\u201d Hillary adapted. Turning to her now signature blonde-hair with no glasses look, Hillary Rodham became Mrs. Bill Clinton for the comeback. Using the Baby Boomer rationale for selling out\u2014err, compromise, she figured: \u201cIt meant more to them\u201d\u2014Arkansans\u2014\u201cthan it did to me.\u201d\n\nHillary thus imagined Bill\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign as her own get-out-of-jail ticket. He exulted: \u201cbuy one, get one free!\u201d She crowed: \u201cIf you vote for him, you get me!\u201d When she back-pedaled, critics snickered. One cartoon had Mrs. Clinton clutching her daughter Chelsea and yammering: \u201cHi there! I\u2019m Hillary Clinton\u2014the new Hillary Clinton! \u2026. Do you like my new hair style? Do you want to hear about my family values?\u201d\n\nIn the White House, Hillary proved to be a polarizing First Lady, too unconventional, too controversial, too close to power for most Americans\u2019 comfort. Many jokes reversed traditional assumptions, by hailing the president\u2026 and her husband, or citing Hillary\u2019s alleged comment after seeing an ex-boyfriend managing a gas station that, if he had stuck with her, he would be running the country and Bill would be pumping gas.\n\nAs First Lady, Hillary Clinton repeatedly changed hair styles, adjusted her roles, experimented with different identities. \u201cIs she Betty Crocker or Eva Peron?\u201d one columnist teased. The role that proved most popular was her fifth incarnation, as Wounded Wife, when her husband betrayed her with Monica Lewinsky, but her dignified suffering and partisan politicking saved his presidency.\n\nPity, not respect, redeemed Hillary Clinton. Before, \u201cnon-feminists\u201d believed she rejected \u201ctheir values, looking down her nose at them,\u201d the Democratic pollster Celinda Lake explained. As a victim, \u201cThey now see her as a woman demonstrating their values.\u201d Maureen Dowd called her the \u201csingle most degraded wife in the history of the world.\u201d\n\nFinally rejecting her \u201cvicarious role,\u201d Hillary became the first First Lady to run for political office. Hillary!\u2014that\u2019s how she ran for Senate in 2000\u2014now emerged as a \u201creal person.\u201d Freed of the First Lady\u2019s baggage, Senator Clinton could wield power comfortably. Secure as a global, first-name-only, celebrity like Madonna or Cher, Hillary could reveal her warm, down-to-earth side.\n\n\n\nAll this patience was supposed to pay off in a 2008 presidential cakewalk, until Barack Obama intervened. Initially, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign was chaotic, with no real strategy beyond expecting victory. She adapted once again, demonstrating grit and grace. Peddling economic populism while benefiting from blue-collar racism against the first black candidate, she finally wooed Midwestern males.\n\nIn her eighth incarnation, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton left no defining doctrine or legendary legacy while leaving her successor a lengthy to-do list. But in visiting 112 countries and crusading for women\u2019s rights, she helped Obama make America\u2019s foreign policy more global and less confrontational.\n\nNow, as presidential hopeful take two, Hillary Rodham Clinton hopes to do it right. Alas, after all these shifts, and the 1990s\u2019 Whitewater shenanigans followed by the recent email scandal, only 42 percent of Americans trust her. She needs ballast and vision to win.\n\nOne key to Hillary Clinton\u2019s sanity, success, and popularity among working women has been her elasticity. Reporters kept boxing her in as \u201csaint\u201d or \u201csinner\u201d (Newsweek), as \u201ccrusader\u201d or \u201chypocrite,\u201d (Vanity Fair). Spurning this zero-sum game, Hillary\u2014like so many working women\u2014has synthesized: working woman and mom, feminist First Lady and feminine First Lady, policy maven and hostess, pioneer and traditionalist.\n\nHillary Clinton now must balance the adaptability she has always shown with a core consistency she has, but frequently fails to project. She must charm voters while tackling controversial issues. She should overcome 2008\u2019s mismanagement while demonstrating the focus of 2000. And, as she has done for four decades, she must manage the blessing and curse of Bill Clinton, tapping his political wiles without being upstaged by his charms or derailed by his demons.\n\nHillary\u2019s confidante Diane Blair noted after chatting with her in 1996, that, \u201cOn her deathbed she wants to be able to say she was true to herself and is not going to do phoney makeovers to please others.\u201d That aspiration will remain unrealized, but this latest, biggest makeover better feel authentic.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:06.637+0000"}

Democratic candidates line up to kiss his ring, and Democratic presidents swing by his house when they\u2019re in town.\n\nAnd, unlike gaffe-shy political candidates, Morgan seems to have zero qualms when it comes to speaking his mind.\n\nSo Clinton might get an earful.\n\nHillary is incredibly wishy-washy on one of Morgan\u2019s biggest issues: medical marijuana legalization.\n\nFor Morgan, it\u2019s personal.\n\n\u201cI think the feds should be attuned to the way marijuana is still used as a gateway drug and how the drug cartels from Latin America use marijuana to get footholds in states.\u201d \u2014 Hillary Clinton, July 2014.\n\nHis younger brother, who is paralyzed from the neck down, uses marijuana every day to manage the pain his condition causes. Morgan invested substantial money in a 2014 effort to amend the state constitution to allow it, and that push came just short of passing.\n\nMorgan says a similar effort will be on the ballot in 2016.\n\nClinton\u2019s stance on medical marijuana is about as obtuse as Morgan\u2019s is clear. The former secretary of state has indicated that she\u2019s comfortable with the Obama administration\u2019s hands-off stance to Washington state and Colorado\u2019s legalization of marijuana, but she\u2019s also telegraphed some Reaganesque views on the drug war.\n\n\u201cI think the feds should be attuned to the way marijuana is still used as a gateway drug and how the drug cartels from Latin America use marijuana to get footholds in states,\u201d she told KPCC radio last July.\n\nTyler Henson, president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, said that comment concerns advocates of legal weed.\n\n\u201cI do worry about some of her previous statements that she\u2019s made, particularly that it\u2019s a gateway drug,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt makes me feel like she doesn\u2019t see the value and the benefits of it.\u201d\n\nAnd Ben Pollara, who worked with Morgan to push for looser marijuana laws in Florida, said her use of the term is a little fuddy-duddy.\n\n\u201cI think that phrase is certainly anachronistic and something that\u2019s been refuted over the years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a phrase that you really don\u2019t hear that much these days from anybody but the hardcore anti-drug folks.\u201d\n\nMorgan told me that he hopes to push Clinton on her stance when she comes by his house.\n\n\u201cI would hope that she\u2019s on my side of that issue, but I do not know that answer,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m going to find out, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope that along this journey that I will help her evolve in her thinking,\u201d he added.\n\nAnd Morgan hasn\u2019t been shy about making life tough for Democrats who back medical marijuana prohibition. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida congresswoman, has drawn pointed criticism for her pro-prohibition stance.\n\n\u201cI know personally the most-powerful players in Washington DC,\u201d Morgan told the Miami Herald after she came down on the wrong side of the issue. \u201cAnd I can tell you that Debbie Wasserman Schultz isn\u2019t just disliked. She\u2019s despised.\u201d\n\nPolitico reported that she offered to change her stance on the issue if Morgan would just take back those harsh words. Her extended olive branch didn\u2019t impress Morgan.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he said, per emails leaked to the Beltway paper. \u201cShe is a bully. I beat bullies up for a living.\u201d\n\n\u201cWasserman Schultz\u2019s office pointed out that she disputes Politico\u2019s reporting on that story and that she told the Sun Sentinel she did not offer to change her stance on the issue.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Morgan\u2019s critics argue that he\u2019s been the worst enemy of his cause. Last September, Morgan gave a four-letter-word-laced talk to raucous college students, encouraging them to vote for the amendment.\n\n\u201cIf you motherfuckers don\u2019t get up and vote, fuck it all, we can\u2019t win, I\u2019m telling you,\u201d he told the crowd, to boisterous cheers.\n\nThat clip ended up in an attack video charging Amendment 2 advocates weren\u2019t acting in good faith. Ryan Wiggins, a Florida Republican consultant who\u2019s done pro-medical marijuana advocacy work, said Morgan\u2019s comments undermined his work.\n\n\u201cI think that John Morgan unfortunately let his ego get in the way of doing something that was potentially good policy for the state of Florida,\u201d he said. \u201cHe put himself out there too much and made it more about him and less about the people he was trying to help.\u201d\n\nMorgan has no apologies.\n\n\u201cThe people who are aghast about me raising hell in a country-western bar are a bunch of tightasses that I don\u2019t give a shit about at all,\u201d he said in his slow Kentucky drawl. \u201cThe people that see that video and are upset are the people that don\u2019t know the difference between marijuana and heroin.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the way, did you hear them cheering when I said \u2018motherfucker\u2019?\u201d he added. \u201cEvery time I said \u2018motherfucker,\u2019 the place went nuts.\u201d\n\nHe added that his language has become a slight point of contention in his home.\n\n\u201cI use the word \u2018motherfucker\u2019 every single day of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife says I can\u2019t anymore because I\u2019ve got a grandchild now, she doesn\u2019t want me cussing around the grandchild. But unfortunately I am profane. But I don\u2019t fucking apologize for it.\u201d\n\nAnd he probably doesn\u2019t need to. The attorney\u2019s salty language hasn\u2019t limited his influence. He counts Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe as a close friend (\u201cWhen Terry comes to town we cook out and smoke cigars and drink red wine,\u201d he said), and Obama came to his house for fundraisers during both of his presidential campaigns. He\u2019s spent time with both Clintons, more with Bill than Hillary, and potential Democratic candidates in Florida queue up to win his imprimatur.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the few really significant, six-figure, seven-figure Democratic donors that\u2019s the go-to for their state folks,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Florida Republican consultant, saying the state party needs support.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re always looking for somebody to keep the lights on at their little tar-paper shack headquarters with their four teenage interns running their Twitter account,\u201d he added.\n\nDemocrats concur\u2014at least as far as his influence on candidates.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the go-to guy in our state,\u201d said Charlie Crist, who ran against Republican Governor Rick Scott in his 2014 reelection bid (and lost to him), and now works for Morgan\u2019s law firm. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think Secretary Clinton\u2019s going to his house next week.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always great to be in his presence,\u201d Crist added. \u201cAlways.\u201d\n\nCrist said he wouldn\u2019t miss the Morgan/Clinton fundraiser for the world.\n\nOne person who won\u2019t be there: Jeb Bush.\n\nMorgan said he inadvertently included Bush on an email blast he sent out inviting Floridians to Friday\u2019s event. Bush emailed him back saying, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I will not be able to make it :)\u201d (Bush\u2019s team didn\u2019t confirm that he sent the emoticon-dotted note).\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a good dude, he\u2019s a good dude,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe definition of a compassionate person. Jeb Bush is a compassionate man.\u201d\n\nMorgan\u2019s wife, a Republican, is also a big Jeb fan. And he said she\u2019s been talking with Bush World about setting up a fundraiser for the candidate.\n\n\u201cShe and Jeb have been communicating,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has talked to Jeb about it, and yeah, that would be something.\u201d\n\nIf that fundraiser goes through, then Morgan might be the only person to welcome both the Democratic and the Republican 2016 frontrunners into his home.\n\nTwo Republicans who will decidedly not be welcome: Scott Walker and Carly Fiorina.\n\n\u201cWalker would be the first president with a GED,\u201d Morgan said, alluding to the fact that the Wisconsin governor doesn\u2019t have a college degree. \u201cWe just cannot have a dumb shit as president. Total dumb shit.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s team didn\u2019t comment on the \u201cdumb shit\u201d characterization.\n\nMorgan also said that Fiorina \u201cis like Cruella de Vil running for president.\u201d\n\nFiorina\u2019s team took issue with that comparison.\n\n\u201cCarly loves her two dogs, Max and Snickers,\u201d said campaign spokeswoman Sarah Isgur Flores. \u201cMax and Snickers love Carly. I think he needs to find a better metaphor.\u201d\n\nMorgan will likely be up to the challenge.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:07.106+0000"}

She made it boring.\n\nAs in-focus civilians flowed up the Trump Tower taking selfies in the background, an inexplicably out-of-focus Donald Trump sought to explain his rising poll numbers on Sarah Palin\u2019s janky new program on an unknown right-wing news network.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re bringing back\u2014I use the term again, (as) it hasn\u2019t been used in a long time\u2014the silent majority,\u201d he told Palin at the tail end of her 10 p.m. newscast, On Point with Sarah Palin, on Friday night.\n\nOf course, Donald Trump appeared once again unaware that the Silent Majority most popularly referred to those Americans who supported the Vietnam War, often viewed as one of the greatest quagmires of our time.\n\nBut Palin, herself, full of platitudes on a network too new or broken to sell ad space (fear not, One America News ran pseudo-PSAs to break up the interview segments instead) did not call him out on it. Instead, the former Republican vice presidential nominee-cum-wider reach public access news anchor offered hard-hitting questions such as this:\n\n\u201cWe appreciate your battles here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re crushing it in the polls.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Talk about] the respect [veterans] have for a truth talker, as opposed to getting punched in the nose in the last seven years under Obama.\u201d\n\nTo be clear, this was a set-\u2019em-up, knock-\u2019em-down campaign speech and not an interview\u2014one in which Sarah Palin largely dominated and made Donald Trump seem like a level-headed centrist by comparison.\n\nPalin preceded Trump\u2019s interview with other ones featuring Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz\u2014both lagging and pixelated on Skype\u2014and, for some reason, Orrin Hatch.\n\nIn Ted Cruz\u2019s interview, he called Planned Parenthood \u201ca criminal enterprise\u201d that he would prosecute if he took office due to viral videos he believed implicated the organization in some kind of baby-parts-for-cash sting. He, of course, ignored Friday\u2019s revelations from The New York Times that said those same videos were heavily doctored all along.\n\nThen, Palin greeted Donald Trump, asking him to set the record straight because \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting the truth out of The White House,\u201d just like she was taught in journalism school. (Journalism, after all, was the emphasis on her bachelor\u2019s degree diploma, which she earned over five years from four different colleges.)\n\nThen came the random haymaker. Behold:\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re seeing some idiots in the press. They\u2019re misrepresenting your exchange with some political activists\u2014the father of the Clinton staffer, Univision\u2019s Jorge Ramos\u2014and you schooled that radical activist,\u201d she said.\n\n\n\nRamos has won eight Emmy Awards for excellence in journalism.\n\n\u201cAnd it was the right thing to do because I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to pull that again. Where\u2019d you get your guts for that radical confrontation?\u201d she asked.\n\nOf course, when Jorge Ramos was forced out of Trump\u2019s interview room earlier this week, he was immediately told to \u201cget out of my country\u201d by a Trump supporter. When the supporter was rebuffed by Ramos\u2014who told him he was, in fact, a U.S. citizen\u2014the heckler replied with, \u201cWell, whatever.\u201d\n\nBut that\u2019s not the point! The point is the courage!\n\n\u201cActually, the press\u2014they agreed with what I did,\u201d says Trump, for some reason not taking the outrage bait.\n\nSo Palin tried again.\n\n\u201cYou get hit with these gotchas, like \u2018What\u2019s your favorite Bible verse?\u2019\u201d said Palin.\n\nThis week, after saying his favorite book was The Bible, Donald Trump didn\u2019t or couldn\u2019t name a verse from it when asked by a reporter for his go-to.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Do they ask Hillary that?\u2019\u201d Palin asked.\n\nTrump has a very reasonable explanation.\n\n\u201cYou saw that. I love The Bible,\u201d he says. \u201c\u2018What\u2019s your favorite verse?\u2019 That\u2019s a very personal thing. I don\u2019t like giving that out. I love The Bible.\u201d\n\nThen, in the same breath, Trump alerted Palin as to how The Bible has helped him, a Presbyterian.\n\n\u201cIn the last poll, I won everything, including the Evangelicals,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m big with the Evangelicals.\u201d\n\nThe church in which Trump claims to be an active member has since contradicted him.\n\nAfter hearing about Trump\u2019s \u201ctremendous standing ovations\u201d once again, Palin had to let Trump go\u2014remember, they had PSAs to play on this very serious news network\u2014but she wanted to let him know one thing first.\n\n\u201cYou are a terrific person, and it\u2019s great to be with you,\u201d she said, journalistically.\n\nAfter the ad space rolled with no ads in it, Sarah Palin went on to commend Curt Schilling for comparing Muslims to Nazis.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:07.394+0000"}

Rand and Cruz aren\u2019t sure. Only Rick Perry is calling BS.\n\nAn Infowars conspiracy theory about military takeover of the American Southwest might become a surprising wedge issue among Texas\u2019s Republican presidential candidates.\n\nThe Daily Beast detailed last week how the Jade Helm 15 military training exercises\u2014wherein U.S. Special Operations forces will move throughout the Southwest preparing for atypical warfare conditions\u2014have set off such a noisy panic that Texas\u2019s governor has ordered the state\u2019s military to keep an eye on things.\n\nConcerns about those training exercises have been fueled by Alex Jones\u2019s goofball site Infowars, which soberly suggested that this might be the beginning of a military war on the Tea Party. That is not a thing that is happening. Still, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas stated he was directing the Lone Star state\u2019s military to tail U.S. troops in part \u201cto ensure that Texas communities remain safe.\u201d Abbott\u2019s move generated much levity, with one Texas Democrat consultant suggesting that the governor\u2019s next area of concern might be abominable snowmen.\n\n\u201cThe civilian leadership, you can always question that, but not the men and women in uniform.\u201d\n\nWhen I was reporting out that story, I reached out to a number of presidential contenders\u2019 camps for comment and got radio silence. Most of the candidates\u2019 spokespeople didn\u2019t even bother to reply to my email, and understandably\u2014who wants to go on the record awkwardly not commenting about a wacky conspiracy theory that has a small but vocal sector of the Republican base buying hollow-tip ammo and investing in survival food?\n\nBut a few of those presidential contenders have spoken about the issue to other media outlets, and their answers are quite telling. On April 21, conservative Iowa talk radio host Jan Mickelson asked Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul if he knew what the deal with Jade Helm was.\n\n\u201cYou know I\u2019ve gotten a few questions about it on the road and I really don\u2019t\u2014\u201d Paul replied, per Talking Points Memo\u2019s transcript. \u201cI\u2019m not sure about exactly what is going on with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s making some people nervous, but it doesn\u2019t take much to make people nervous nowadays,\u201d Mickelson replied. \u201cIf you get a chance to, I\u2019d like to know what the rest of the story is on that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll look at that also,\u201d the Kentucky senator replied.\n\nNever fear, citizens of the Southwest: Rand Paul is going to make sure the military doesn\u2019t take over your Whataburgers.\n\nNot to be outdone, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told Bloomberg at the South Carolina Republican convention that he\u2019d had his office reach out to the Pentagon to make sure everything is OK.\n\n\u201cWe are assured it is a military training exercise,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no reason to doubt those assurances, but I understand the reason for concern and uncertainty, because when the federal government has not demonstrated itself to be trustworthy in this administration, the natural consequence is that many citizens don\u2019t trust what it is saying.\u201d\n\nFormer Texas governor Rick Perry drew the sharpest contrast with Abbott\u2019s Infowars pandering.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s OK to question your government.

But if he decides to run, he\u2019ll face questions about its contribution to our exploding prison population.\n\nTwenty-one years after helping to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act as a Delaware senator, Joe Biden is still touting it.\n\n\u201cIt put another 100,000 cops on the street, and it cost $1 billion,\u201d he wrote in April, in a release through NYU\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cBut because crime was rampant, everybody signed on. And it worked.\u201d\n\nThe landmark legislation, now known as the 1994 Biden Crime Bill, was expansive and wide-reaching, and it outlaws civilian ownership of assault rifles, possibly the most substantial gun ban in recent American history.\n\nBut advocates for prison reform, one of the key issues in the upcoming 2016 presidential race, say one part of the bill is indefensible and contributed to the mass incarceration problem that has made America the most imprisoned citizenry in the Western world.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big bill, but it\u2019s a pretty bad bill,\u201d said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project. \u201cThere\u2019s no question it was designed to be a tough on crime bill. That\u2019s how President Clinton talked about it at his State of the Union address. The only reason there\u2019s some half-decent stuff in there is because the Congressional Black Caucus was very adamant about the direction of the bill.\u201d\n\nIf Biden decides to run in 2016, he could face questions about the so-called 1994 Biden Crime Bill, which created financial incentives for states to jail more people and keep them in prison for considerably longer sentences.\n\nProtesters from the Black Lives Matter Movement have already interrupted speeches from Bernie Sanders, Jeb Bush, and Hillary Clinton in recent weeks, demanding the presidential candidates lay out definitive plans for overcrowded jails and too-strict sentences on nonviolent offenders.\n\nMauer points to a $4 billion promise to the states that adopted \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d requirements. Those requirements forced violent offenders to stay in prison for 85 percent or more of their sentences. Some states, like Mississippi, took it even further\u2014mandating that all offenders serve 85 percent of their term before being considered for release.\n\nIf the states met those requirements, each would receive a slice of the $4 billion in incentives. By 1998, 27 states and Washington, D.C., met the criteria.\n\nBy 1997, almost 70 percent of those jailed for violent crime were imprisoned in one of the truth-in-sentencing states.\n\nBut Mauer, whose nonprofit advocates for criminal justice reform, said the talk around the bill had an equally deleterious effect.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame it all on Clinton or Biden. But we\u2019re still paying the bill for those laws today. And we will for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was important in a symbolic sense. When a bill is paid attention to that much in Congress, it gets a lot more attention. It\u2019s hard to quantify. But it clearly contributed to the rhetoric around crime,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201c[Bill] Clinton talked about the need for a \u2018three strikes\u2019 policy in the State of the Union. There was no mandate, but the language around it made it clear.\u201d\n\nToday some who applauded the Biden Bill\u2019s passage when it was signed into law are speaking out against its more punitive elements.\n\n\u201cThere was a move in the country to lengthen prison sentences. One of the vehicles, in essence, paid states if they made their sentences tougher,\u201d said Jeremy Travis, former director of the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Department of Justice.\n\nTravis is now president of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. He served on a committee with colleagues Bruce Western and Steve Redburn that explored the \u201ccauses and consequences of high rates of incarceration\u201d for the National Research Council\u2014and part of their findings implicates the Biden Bill.\n\n\u201cThese changes in sentencing reflected a consensus that viewed incarceration as a key instrument for crime control. Yet over the four decades when incarceration rates steadily rose, U.S. crime rates showed no clear trend,\u201d Travis and his colleagues wrote.\n\n\u201cMandatory prison sentences intensified enforcement of drug laws, and long sentences contributed not only to overall high rates of incarceration, but also especially to extraordinary rates of incarceration in black and Latino communities.\u201d\n\nBut Travis emphasized that the parts of the bill that created incentives for states to increase sentences were necessary concessions to Senate Republicans. Otherwise, he said, the bill never would have had a chance.\n\n\u201cThe pieces of the bill that Joe Biden is most closely identified with have generally been very well accepted. The Violence Against Women Act [also included in the bill] has been acknowledged by everybody as a tremendous influence,\u201d Travis said.\n\n\u201cThe parts of the bill that put more people in prison in our country\u2014that\u2019s a Republican part of the bill. The part that I\u2019m on record being critical of is funding states to increase the length of sentences.\u201d\n\nStill, Mauer said a bill like this\u2014one that was co-sponsored by Biden, signed into law by Bill Clinton, and even helped through the Senate with a yea vote by Bernie Sanders\u2014would have no chance today. He doesn\u2019t even think it would garner much support on the right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d see anybody in either party somebody coming out for one of those tough-on-crime bills in 2015,\u201d Mauer said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s reasonable support for change on both sides,\u201d he added. \u201cHillary Clinton gave a big speech about mass incarceration recently. Bernie Sanders is speaking along those lines, too. On the right, John Kasich has probably been the most outspoken. Rand Paul even co-sponsored legislation with [Democratic Senator] Cory Booker on criminal justice reform earlier this year.\u201d\n\nThe tide is changing, Mauer said, but there is a long way to go to undo the series of \u201ctough-on-crime\u201d bills, policies, and rhetoric that led to America\u2019s unique mass incarceration problem.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not ready to declare victory and go home yet. We still don\u2019t have a sentencing bill that\u2019s moving through Congress this year,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd even though the bill was passed on Bill Clinton\u2019s desk\u2014and was written in Joe Biden\u2019s name\u2014Mauer said the onus is on everyone who voted for those bills in a climate of fear.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t blame it all on Clinton or Biden,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we\u2019re still paying the bill for those laws today.

The DNC itself was a target, and Clinton\u2019s challengers hit at it repeatedly and to great applause.\n\nFormer Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley hooked his entire speech around a linguistic barb, calling out the Democrats\u2019 lack of debates for being literally \u201cundemocratic.\u201d More daringly, Senator Bernie Sanders warbled a doomsday tune: If the Democrats continue with \u201cpolitics as usual,\u201d \u201cestablishment politics or establishment economics,\u201d he warned, then they \u201cwill not retain the White House, will not regain the Senate, will not gain the House and will not be successful in dozens of governor\u2019s races.\u201d The only part of his speech that wasn\u2019t vicious criticism was clearly a lie: \u201cWith all due respect,\u201d he said, \u201cand I do not mean to insult anyone here.\u201d\n\nWell, on that last part Sanders might well tell true. By the time he had spoken, Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t there.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s rhetoric was craftier\u2014lines like that prodded applause that seemed to fade in confusion, as if Hillary supporters could not help but endorse a distinction between their party and Trump, but then had to remember who was drawing the distinction from whom.\n\nCynics might say that was according to plan. The day\u2019s speaking schedule, advertised as being in alphabetic order, put Clinton in a sweet spot: mid-morning, right after a wistful and mild Lincoln Chaffee. Not a bad expectation-setter, as opening acts go.\n\nMore fodder for those looking for conspiracy: Her speech went 10 minutes longer than the committee claimed to allow. Her lack of nerves showed. She hit every mark, nailed every applause line and even summoned some laughs. (Truly, Donald Trump\u2019s most significant Democratic donation is in-kind: He\u2019s given Hillary a punchline that\u2019s not about email, and a few more about hair.)\n\nHer delivery reflected the deliberate lack of urgency her entire campaign wants to convey. Going into the the committee\u2019s meeting, the Clinton campaign placed a story claiming the primary all but over before a single vote has been cast. With 130 superdelegates already publicly committed, Clinton officials told \u201csupporters and the undecided\u201d that \u201cprivate commitments increase that number to more than 440\u2014about 20 percent\u201d of what she needs to for the nomination itself.\n\nI have my doubts about that story, mainly because it\u2019s impossible to check. But as important as whether it\u2019s true is that Clinton\u2019s people want everyone to believe it.\n\nSanders\u2019s success in turning out crowds has given him the most obvious retort. At the meeting itself, his supporters were raucous and eager to stand, rising from their chairs to thunder approval at a litany of not just good progressive causes (from mass incarceration to the minimum wage)\u2014the same stuff of Hillary\u2019s speech hours before. Even more insistently, they hooted encouragement at Sanders\u2019s thundering against the establishment that Sanders was there to address. His argument was Sanders-centered but succinct: I am generating crowds and excitement, and without them, the Obama coalition is going to stay home.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s argument was necessarily more small-bore, but ingeniously formed. Sanders\u2019s doomsaying was non-specific and grim\u2014invoking the specter of loss but not focusing that much on what they\u2019d lose to. O\u2019Malley, on the other hand, mounted a race against Trump\u2014and his platform was simple: \u201cWe\u2019re better than this.\u201d Without more debates, he asserted, the Democratic Party will cede the whole conversation: \u201cWill we let the circus run unchallenged on every channel, as we cower in the shadows under a decree of silence in the ranks?\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019s crowd may have been more ardent, but O\u2019Malley\u2019s rhetoric was craftier\u2014lines like that prodded applause that seemed to fade in confusion, as if Hillary supporters could not help but endorse a distinction between their party and Trump, but then had to remember who was drawing the distinction from whom.\n\nBoth Sanders and O\u2019Malley\u2019s boldness fell short of breaking the Clinton omerta from the podium. They declined to furnish ad fodder for next fall. But in the press conferences afterwards, egged on by reporters to go from bank shots to point blank, both men were unable to resist direct jabs.\n\nBoth were asked whether the debate schedule was rigged in Hillary\u2019s favor, and both simply said, \u201cYes.\u201d O\u2019Malley in particular couldn\u2019t wait to say more. He was proud of how obvious he\u2019d been: \u201cI don\u2019t think I was hinting, I thought I was pretty clear.\u201d Sanders dredged up some sarcasm when a reporter wanted to know if by \u201cestablishment\u201d he meant Hillary: \u201cI\u2019ll let you use your imagination on that.\u201d\n\nWho knows what Clinton makes of all this.

{"entityId": 1549, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why Sanders draws the crowds, excites the base, polls relatively well\u2014and still won\u2019t make much of an impact in 2016.\n\nSo Bernie Sanders is lighting it up in Iowa, reports the Times, knockin\u2019 \u2019em dead, outdrawing Jeb Bush and all the Republicans.\n\nThe excitement is palpable. And yet, I will make a prediction to you now. Sanders will win one primary: Vermont. If I\u2019m proven correct he will have done exactly as well as another Vermonter, Howard Dean, who entered the primaries in 2004 positioning himself to the left of the major candidates. He forgot about the importance of field organizing, got chewed up in Iowa over a scream (unfairly so, actually), and after being the favorite for about two weeks in December 2003 went on to enter 31 primaries and win just the one, in his home state.\n\nWhat is it about Vermont? Is this just coincidence that Dean and now Sanders have emerged as the most prominent and credible left-flank candidates of recent times? Probably not.\n\nVermont\u2019s demographic changes in recent years, the way counter-cultural types have flocked to places like Burlington, are unique; neighboring New Hampshire is a very different place, and even Massachusetts, while liberal, features a different kind of liberalism, at once more blue-collar (think Fall River and Lowell) and more pointy-headed (all those universities). In a sense, what Texas is to the GOP, Vermont is to the Democrats: the party\u2019s ideological ground zero.\n\nThis is not of course to say that Sanders has anything in common with Ted Cruz beyond the fact that both are U.S. senators. For one thing, if Cruz is drawing crowds upwards of several hundred in Iowa, he\u2019s keeping it a pretty good secret. And the fact that he\u2019s not drawing such crowds reflects the most obvious difference between the two, namely that Cruz says lots of unpopular crazy extremist things, and Sanders is mostly just saying things that are probably a little out there in terms of the Washington conventional wisdom but are not in reality crazy at all, like reining in the power of big banks.\n\nSanders makes a great foil to Clinton because he is everything liberal activists believe (sometimes fairly, sometimes unfairly) she is not. He\u2019s blunt, she\u2019s circumspect. He doesn\u2019t care what anyone thinks, she\u2019s uber-cautious. On a debate stage with her and Martin O\u2019Malley, Sanders can just tee off and say exactly what the rank and file wants to hear in ways that neither Clinton nor the former Maryland governor can.\n\nLiberals love this because they don\u2019t get much of it in political life today. On the Republican side, the candidates fall over themselves to prove how conservative they are, and indeed the word \u201cconservative\u201d flies out of their mouths every 18 seconds. Democrats are usually terrified of speaking that bluntly, so when one does\u2014and Sanders isn\u2019t a Democrat, but let\u2019s not get technical\u2014liberals swoon. So he\u2019ll generate crowds and enthusiasm and he\u2019ll press Clinton on some issues. All to the good.\n\nHe probably won\u2019t have the money or the field operation\u2014hers, in Iowa, is already formidable\u2014to challenge her in a serious way. But the great unanswered question here is not about him, but about Clinton, to wit: How deep is the dissatisfaction with her among liberal Democrats?\n\nIf you follow the political pronouncements of the liberal activist class closely, you might think it\u2019s very deep indeed. The whole Draft Warren movement, led by MoveOn.org, is (or do we now say was?) predicated on the conviction that Clinton is certain to sell the liberal base out to Wall Street. One hears this a lot among insiders, and if this is a conviction that is widely shared by rank-and-file Democrats, then Sanders can certainly exceed my expectations.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get the misimpression that there\u2019s more rank-and-file resistance to Clinton among Democratic voters than there actually is.\n\nBut I just don\u2019t think the distrust runs that deep. I have before me here a Gallup poll from March showing that Clinton is rather popular among Democrats and the Democratic-leaners questioned in this surveyed. Her favorable-to-unfavorable rating was 79 to 13 percent, or a multiple of six. Sanders\u2019s numbers were 21 to 8. (Interestingly, Elizabeth Warren\u2019s were 37 to 9, a multiple of just four, and with a surprisingly high 53 percent having no opinion.)\n\nSeventy-nine to 13 isn\u2019t what I\u2019d call dissatisfaction. The key fact is that the 13 are overrepresented in the chattering class and among the most committed party activists. It\u2019s always been this way among the group we might call super-insiders, the people who blog and tweet and are willing to do things like drive 70 miles across the plains on a weeknight to go see an insurgent candidate whose realistic chance of becoming president is fractional.\n\nThe Clinton appeal to this set has always been limited. I can\u2019t pinpoint exactly why it is. For starters, the Clintons never curried their favor or flattered them. In her case, of course, a lot of it has to do with her support for the Iraq war (which Bill backed too, to the extent that his position mattered). More broadly, the Clintonian issues palette has never jibed very closely with the special passions of this plugged-in activist class I\u2019m talking about.\n\nTake for example net neutrality under Title II, which is of great interest to this group. Clinton endorsed net neutrality after Barack Obama made his announcement, but she\u2019s never been associated with the issue, and even in the act of endorsing Obama\u2019s position, she sounded pretty meh about the whole thing: \u201cAs I understand it, it\u2019s Title II with a lot of changes in it to avoid the worst of Title II regulation. It\u2019s a foot in the door ... but it\u2019s not the end of the discussion.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get the misimpression that there\u2019s more rank-and-file resistance to Clinton among Democratic voters than there actually is. And the press of course doesn\u2019t like her and wants a race. All this will work to Sanders\u2019s benefit. A significant number of Democrats may want to send Clinton a warning shot, keep her pivoting leftward; but the idea that there\u2019s a large bloc of Anybody But Hillary Democrats out there is just a fantasy.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:08.388+0000"}

{"entityId": 1551, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why you\u2019re unlikely to hear much about an independent presidential effort in 2016.\n\nWith only 245 days before the (often not) highly important Iowa caucuses, some familiar portents of the pre-game activities have appeared.\n\nThere\u2019s the increasingly desperate effort of the Iowa Republican Party to preserve its quadrennial exercise in extortion known as the Iowa Straw Poll. (Carroll County GOP chair Craig Williams asks of potential candidates, \u201cIf they can\u2019t do that, how can we expect them to face ISIS?\u201d) Several journalists wistfully suggest that perhaps, just maybe, this will be the year of the brokered convention, when we bond with the hacks of yesteryear, wondering where the votes of the Ohio delegation will go on the third ballot.\n\nBut there\u2019s one traditional sign of the season that has yet to appear: the emergence of a movement for an independent or third party presidential run. At a time when discontent with politics as usual is peaking, and when the structural barriers to a third-party run have effectively disappeared, the silence is deafening and in sharp contrast to the previous cycles.\n\nBack in 2007, \u201cUnity \u201908,\u201d led by former Democratic operatives Hamilton Jordan and Gerald Rafshoon, prominent Republican consultant Doug Bailey, and ex-Maine Governor (now Senator) Angus King tried to organize an online convention to slate a bipartisan national ticket.\n\nFour years later, it was the turn of \u201cAmericans Elect.\u201d Former New Jersey Governor Christie Todd Whitman, pollster Doug Schoen, and Democrat-turned-Bush-backer Mark McKinnon tried to organize a \u201cnational on-line primary\u201d to pick a nominee. Names like Condoleeza Rice, Warren Buffett and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg were offered up, but the effort crashed and burned.\n\nThose efforts were fueled by a conviction that Americans are highly discontent with the two-party system. This is something polls showed eight years ago, four years\u2014and now. Last September, Gallup reported that 58 percent of Americans want an alternative to the two parties; about the same percentage did back in 2007 and 2011. Moreover, 67 percent of Americans now say they\u2019re comfortable with voting for an independent presidential candidate. A record high percentage of Americans identify themselves as independent (there\u2019s less here than meets the eye, as I\u2019ll explain in a moment), and nearly two-thirds of Americans say they are dissatisfied with the way our government works.\n\nWith paralysis in Washington on display on a daily basis, it\u2019s remarkable that a third of the country doesn\u2019t share that opinion.\n\nThis sure feels like a fertile soil for the growth of an alternative to the two parties that have won every election for the last 155 years; especially when there\u2019s a substantial\u2014let\u2019s not call it \u201chealthy\u201d\u2014prospect of a general election campaign between Clinton II and Bush III whose common theme song might well be \u201dDon\u2019t Stop Thinking About The Day Before Yesterday.\u201d\n\nAnd more important, two long-standing barriers to an effective third-party campaign have now been dismantled. Getting on a state ballot was once an obstacle course of Olympian dimensions: huge numbers of signatures on petitions gathered under sever constraints of time and place. But Ross Perot\u2019s 1992 campaign spent several million dollars winning in court after court to get those restrictions thrown out. (Florida, once the most inhospitable of states, adopted a ballot access rule so friendly that in 2000, 10 presidential candidates were on the ballot\u2014which is why Palm Beach County elections supervisor Theresa Le Pore devised a clever \u201cbutterfly\u201d ballot to get every candidate on the same page, which\u2026.well, you know.)\n\nIn 1992, when Perot won 19 percent of the popular vote, the gap between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush was nothing compared to the distance between Obama and Romney.\n\nIn the past, third-party efforts were strangled by financial restrictions. In the wake of Watergate, campaign finance reforms provided public funds for major party candidates, while others had to wait until after the election to see if they had won enough votes to qualify for public money.\n\nFirst, the appetite for such an effort is in part more rhetorical than real. Take, for instance, that \u201cplurality\u201d of Americans who say they are independent. As Amy Walter noted in the Cook Political Report last year, the great majority of these voters in fact vote as partisans almost all the time. It sounds good to think of yourself as independent; it suggests you are a voter of discernment and thoughtfulness. In fact, Walter says, only 10 percent of the electorate is genuinely independent.\n\nSecond, the most recent experience with a third-party campaign was a powerful\u2014and, depending on your politics, painful\u2014teaching moment. In 2000, Ralph Nader won just under 2.9 million votes (or 2.75 percent). Just over 97,000 of those votes came from Florida.\n\nThere\u2019s a very plausible if not definitive case that those votes cost Gore the state, and thus the White House. In his own highly self-serving account of the campaign, Crashing the Party, Nader uses exit poll data to conclude that his campaign cost Gore more than 12,000 votes; he lost the state (officially) by 537. For chastened liberals, that outcome\u2014and the subsequent eight years\u2014put a powerful check on the \u201cnot a dime\u2019s worth of difference\u201d impulse that drives many third-party efforts.\n\nThat connects to another brake on the temptation to leave the parties: polarization. Whether the electorate has become more polarized, the parties clearly have. A Venn diagram of the Congress would show that the most liberal Republican\u2019s voting record is more conservative than the most conservative Democrat\u2019s, which means that the consequences of voting for an independent seem much more severe than in earlier times.\n\nIn 1992, when Perot won 19 percent of the popular vote, the gap between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush was nothing compared to the distance between Obama and Romney. For a \u201cmoderate partisan,\u201d the risk-reward balance was very different than it is today.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the underlying reality that the American political system is still heavily weighted to a two-party system. In a parliamentary democracy with proportional representation, a slice of the popular vote translates into political power, and a regional party can turn its votes into serious clout. The Scottish National Party, for example, has 56 seats in the British parliament.\n\nIn the United States, by contrast, an independent presidential campaign can at most yield a handful or two of electoral votes. In 1948, segregationist South Carolina governor Strom Thurmond won less than 2\u00bd percent of the national vote, but won four Southern states with 39 electoral votes; Perot\u2019s 19 percent of the popular vote in 1992 won him\u2014none.\n\nSuch an outcome will discourage even the most plausible of candidates, In the run-up to 2008, with some staffers and supporters urging New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to run, he told me: \u201cLook, I could spend half a billion dollars\u201d\u2014[words no one has spoken to me before or since in any capacity]\u2014\u201cand the most I\u2019d accomplish would be to deadlock the electoral college.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the candidate who had the strongest reason to run was George Wallace in 1968\u2014who hoped to wield the balance of power in the Electoral College, trading his electors for a promise to weaken the civil-rights efforts of Washington. It almost worked.\n\nIt is, of course, very early in the campaign season, however hard that is to remember in the avalanche of coverage. Discontent could ripen into something stronger something that might morph into a movement to challenge the biopoly.\n\nMeanwhile, I\u2019m working hard to repeal the anti-smoking ordinances of Philadelphia and Cleveland; after all, you can\u2019t have a brokered convention without a smoke-filled room.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:08.959+0000"}

He was officially a presidential candidate for about 20 minutes before a coordinated heckling campaign hijacked his announcement and pushed him into unplanned territory.\n\nIt felt like inverted d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu; just a few months ago, Bush joined Sean Hannity for a Q&A session on the main stage of CPAC, and a cadre of Tea Party activists and Rand Paul supporters made a dramatic exit in the middle of the former Florida governor\u2019s speech.

A transcript of his remarks released to media as he began to deliver his speech didn\u2019t include any references to the contentious issue. Bush\u2019s stance on immigration reform is probably more detailed than any other contender\u2019s, Republican or Democrat. Still, his hesitance to talk about it on the announcement stage makes sense, given that it\u2019s a highly polarizing issue for much of the Republican base.\n\nBut if the former governor thought he\u2019d get through his announcement without addressing the issue, he was dead wrong. When the protesters appeared, C-SPAN cameras cut away from Bush to pan across their display, and he paused his speech. Then he went off-script to acknowledge their concerns.\n\n\u201cThe next president of the United States will pass meaningful immigration reform, so that that will be solved\u2014not by executive order!\u201d he said.\n\nThat line wasn\u2019t in the speech, and it\u2019s mostly a reiteration of what he\u2019s argued in the past about the need for a comprehensive immigration overhaul. But it\u2019s probably still going to get him in trouble.\n\n\u201cSo Jeb\u2019s response to amnesty hecklers is to...promise amnesty. #SuperAwesome,\u201d tweeted conservative blogger Drew McCoy.\n\nThe protesters\u2019 shirts called for a pathway to citizenship for immigrants living illegally in the country. Hillary Clinton staked out this position in May, arguing that anything short of citizenship would be unjust. Bush argued in his book on immigration policy, Immigration Wars: Forging an American Solution, that a pathway to citizenship would be unfair to immigrants who sought citizenship through legal routes.\n\nBut Bush also has indicated that he would be OK with letting undocumented immigrants become U.S. citizens as long as it was part of a legislative overhaul that included his policy goals. He said as much in an interview on Fox News with Megyn Kelly in May.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said, as long as there\u2014if that was the way to get to a deal, where we turned immigration into a catalyst for high, sustained economic growth, where we did all the things we needed to do in border security, where we narrowed the number of people coming through family petition and dramatically expanded a like-kind number for economic purposes, which will help us grow and help the median rise up, in return for that, as a compromise, sure,\u201d he said.\n\nHe shot down the hecklers by reiterating that sentiment\u2014that comprehensive immigration reform could make everybody happy. That is, everybody except for many of the conservative primary voters who could hold the keys to the Republican kingdom.\n\nBush will spend the rest of this week darting from early state to early state, talking foreign affairs with veterans in South Carolina and economics at an opera house in New Hampshire.

But his money and influence didn\u2019t do him much good when Jeb Bush became governor of Florida.\n\nIt was an October day in Miami, 1985, and Leonel Martinez didn\u2019t want to die.\n\nMargarita Escobar\u2014a Colombian woman known as La Doctora and rumored to be a distant relative of Pablo Escobar\u2014had paid Martinez, a construction magnate, a hefty sum to move 12 duffel bags of cocaine from The Bahamas to Miami on his luxury yacht. The load got intercepted en route, though, and La Doctora wanted her money back. But Martinez didn\u2019t have it.\n\nSo she called him up and said she would be visiting his office. Martinez did the natural thing: He bought a Cadillac limousine, sent it to pick up her and her bodyguard at the airport\u2014in an effort to project wealth he didn\u2019t quite have\u2014and welcomed her to his office.\n\nShe demanded he produce the cash. He didn\u2019t have it, and he offered her 10 condominiums instead. But that wasn\u2019t good enough. Give her the money, she said, or she\u2019d kill him.\n\n\u201cYou can kill me, or you can wait,\u201d he replied.\n\nShe decided to wait, and she flew back to Colombia. Then Martinez got to work rustling up the thousands he owed her.\n\nOverlooking that conversation was a wall plastered with pictures of Martinez glad-handing some of South Florida\u2019s most powerful political luminaries. That\u2019s because the drug trafficker\u2014according to a retired DEA agent and a retired Metro Dade police officer who worked to hunt him down\u2014had a knack for creating the illusion of intimacy with elected officials.\n\nA few of those officials had the last name Bush.\n\nBut those donations didn\u2019t get him much.\n\nIn fact, as governor, Jeb Bush became a favorite of drug warriors. He mirrored his father\u2019s tough-on-drugs tactics in Florida, won the loyalty of cops and DEA agents, and showed the limits of money in politics.\n\nWhen Jeb arrived in South Florida after the 1980 presidential campaign, it was a crazy time.\n\nThe use of drug money in politics was commonplace.\n\nIn fact, his dad\u2019s presidential campaign and the Jeb-helmed Dade County Republican Party both took contributions from Martinez, and faced minimal political repercussions when Martinez\u2019s true career was revealed.\n\nEduardo Gamarra, a professor in Florida International University\u2019s department of politics and international relations, said at that time Southern Florida was so saturated with cocaine-tainted cash that it would have been odd if none of it could get traced to Jeb.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just the way things were in the 1980s,\u201d he said.\n\nGamarra added that grip-and-grin photos with drug dealers didn\u2019t immediately mean the politician was in league with them. Even then-state attorney Janet Reno appeared in a photo with Martinez when he was being investigated for bribery.\n\nMartinez moved from Cuba to Miami when Castro rose to power, and he proceeded to build a successful construction business\u2014with a lucrative marijuana- and cocaine-trafficking business on the side.\n\nHe also made a number of contributions to the Dade County Republican Party when young Jeb Bush chaired it, as Jack Colhoun detailed in an essay in the anthology Covert Action: The Roots of Terrorism. Martinez won respect in Republican circles and, according to his former defense attorney Ron Dresnick, even managed to snag a photo with Jeb. It was never released.\n\nThis came at a time when Jeb was laying some of the groundwork for the GOP\u2019s eventual and total takeover of state-level politics there. In 1984, Politico wrote, 4,000 Democrats became Republicans and 74 percent of Hispanics to join the voter rolls that year registered with the GOP.\n\nThat success ballooned, and Bush carried Miami-Dade in both of his successful gubernatorial campaigns. His impact in the Sunshine State is hard to overstate.\n\nAnd a tiny little statistically insignificant sliver of it was thanks to coke money.\n\n\u201cJust like today everybody has to be a badass when it comes to fighting terrorists, the \u201980s and \u201990s were really the same. You had to demonstrate that you were a drug warrior.\u201d\n\nBy 1989, Martinez was unmasked as a narcotrafficker. The Miami Herald reported that he had promised to give a covert Drug Enforcement Administration informant a dump truck worth $80,000 and five lots worth $120,000 in exchange for 300 kilograms of cocaine. The Herald also noted that, in a government affidavit, between 1981 and 1989 Martinez and his team endeavored to move hundreds of pounds of marijuana and \u201cmulti-hundred kilogram shipments of cocaine\u201d into Southern Florida. As one does.\n\nThe Martinez case was representative of a South Florida cocaine problem of cartoonish proportions\u2014a culture where Jeb\u2019s political ambitions first began to flourish.\n\n\u201cIt was a nuthouse,\u201d recalled Tom Raffanello, a former Special Agent in Charge of the DEA\u2019s Miami Field Division, who had that position for three years of Jeb\u2019s governorship there. \u201cWe averaged two drug-related shootings a month for almost two years. Everybody had a gun. Everybody was pissed off all the time.\u201d\n\nTony Kost, a retired Metro-Dade Police Department detective who worked to apprehend Martinez, Dominic Albanese (a retired DEA agent who worked on the investigation), and Raffanello all praised Jeb\u2019s work to continue the prosecution of the Drug War that started when his father, George H.W. Bush, was vice president for Ronald Reagan.\n\nIt\u2019s an interesting story of the failure of money in politics; though Martinez managed to donate his way into the good graces of South Florida Republicans, some of his favorite politicians ended up being the most dogged foes of his industry.\n\nAlbanese said that Jeb Bush\u2019s support of the War on Drugs\u2014despite inadvertently appearing in a photo with a powerful drug trafficker\u2014speaks to his integrity.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say enough good things about what the Bushes did for the anti-drug department, I\u2019m telling you now,\u201d he added. \u201cI know where we would have been if it wasn\u2019t for them. We\u2019d be in deep kimchi right now, I\u2019m telling you, with the drug problems.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush appointed the state\u2019s first drug czar, Jim McDonough, just a month after he assumed office. McDonough\u2019s responsibilities included coordinating statewide efforts to curtail the import and distribution of narcotics. Bush prioritized streamlining the communications between different agencies and governments\u2014local, state, and federal\u2014to make anti-drug efforts more efficient.\n\nGamarra, a Democrat, also said taking Martinez\u2019s cocaine cash shouldn\u2019t taint the Bush family\u2019s anti-drug legacy.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of popular to go around saying we\u2019ve lost the drug war,\u201d he said, \u201cbut South Florida really demonstrates how they built up the correct kind of legislation\u2014financial controls and so on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to find an airplane flying into the Everglades dumping cocaine,\u201d he added. \u201cMiami has drug problems today but this is not the 1980s by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d\n\nGamarra described Bush and his team as \u201cthe best drug warriors in town.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust like today everybody has to be a badass when it comes to fighting terrorists, the \u201980s and \u201990s were really the same,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou had to demonstrate that you were a drug warrior, that you were in favor of all the extreme kind of measures to stop drugs coming into the United States.\u201d\n\nData from the U.S. Department of Justice indicates that total violent crime grew at a slower rate than Florida\u2019s overall population during Bush\u2019s governorship.\n\nWhile the population grew steadily, from 15.1 million people in 1999 to 18.3 million in 2007, the number of violent crimes committed in the state ebbed and flowed. In 1999, there were 129,044 total violent offenses. That number dipped to a low of 123,754 in 2004. And it grew to 129,602 in 2006, his last full year as governor.\n\nThat violent crime didn\u2019t grow at the same rate as the population seems to corroborate the anecdotal evidence from South Florida\u2019s top drug warriors\u2014that, with time, the state became less bloody.\n\nRaffanello said Bush\u2019s efforts to improve communication between local sheriffs, the DEA, and other law enforcement arms were particularly fruitful.\n\nAs governor, he and his wife, Columba, participated in yearly Tallahassee summits that brought together the state\u2019s drug warriors for networking, planning, and coordination. Raffanello said the impact of those meetings\u2014and the impact of the governor\u2019s involvement with them\u2014made statewide enforcement efforts more organized and effective.\n\n\u201cI thought he really gave a shit,\u201d Raffanello said. \u201cIt\u2019s refreshing to see a politician care about an issue.\u201d\n\nSo his efforts seem to have made Florida less violent and crazy, but Gamarra said the overall outcome was mixed. While drug-related violence went down, there weren\u2019t great results as far as overall drug use.\n\n\u201cThe objective of all of this stuff was to stop the flow of drugs into the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we have just as many drugs coming into the United States today as we did in 1985. And the price is cheaper and quality of the drugs is better.\u201d\n\nStill, Raffanello said Jeb\u2019s greatest impact was the shift of drug violence from the Sunshine State to the U.S.-Mexico border, saying the violence in Florida decreased \u201cexponentially.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe probably had three of the most successful years we had in the last two decades,\u201d he said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:09.404+0000"}

In wrestling, the grapplers talk trash before the match starts. In politics, they mostly do their trash talking after the match is over.\n\nIt\u2019s now been more than a week since Donald Trump encountered\u2014at what should have been a routine news conference at the Grand River Center in Dubuque, Iowa\u2014something the billionaire real estate developer is not used to seeing: an ego as big as his own.\n\nThe healthy self-image belongs to Univision anchor Jorge Ramos, perhaps the nation\u2019s most popular Spanish-language media figure and sometime activist.\n\nI\u2019m being careful not to use the \u201cj-word.\u201d While Ramos considers himself a journalist\u2014apparently a weird hybrid blend of anchor, reporter, analyst and commentator\u2014I\u2019m not sure, given how he conducted himself at the Iowa news conference, that the newsman can still lay claim to the title.\n\nFor one thing, Ramos trampled at least a dozen rules and customs dictating how journalists are supposed to behave. Ramos was unprofessional in his demeanor and impolite to his colleagues. He made himself the story, posed arguments rather than questions, and freely expressed his own opinions.\n\nHe also played the victim when challenged, and failed to disclose at that moment a potential conflict of interest\u2014that his daughter works for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nThe mainstream media\u2014including NBC News\u2019s Kasie Hunt, who was in the ballroom when the Ramos/Trump collision took place\u2014absolved Ramos of his sins, rationalizing his unprofessionalism as proof of how much he cares about the immigration issue.\n\nRamos has long been compromised by the fact that his employer, Univision, has such strong ties to the Obama administration and Democrats.\n\nTrump was surprisingly less forgiving. He doesn\u2019t think that Ramos is much of a journalist, as he made clear the next morning on NBC\u2019s Today Show. The newsman, Trump said, was \u201ctotally out of line\u201d when he \u201cstood up and started ranting and raving like a madman.\u201d\n\nRamos quickly returned fire. During an appearance a few days later on ABC News\u2019s This Week, Ramos called Trump \u201cdangerous\u201d and accused the GOP frontrunner of \u201cpromoting in his speeches bigotry and hatred against immigrants and Latinos.\u201d\n\nBoth men insist that they have received nothing but positive feedback from their respective fan bases.\n\nTeam Trump thinks Ramos was acting more like an advocate than a journalist; Team Ramos thinks Trump tried to stifle criticism. If the goal was to get attention, both men came out winners. So we can expect more mutually beneficial run-ins between these two, as Trump himself seemed to imply at the end of the exchange when he told Ramos: \u201cYou and me will talk. We\u2019re going to be talking a lot over the years.\u201d\n\nThe Univision anchor/activist acknowledges that he flew to Iowa to confront Trump about the candidate\u2019s immigration plan. But when Ramos jumped to his feet and started speaking, drowning out another reporter, the businessman admonished him: \u201cSit down, you weren\u2019t called. Go back to Univision.\u201d Trump then signaled one of the security guards (who also happens to be his bodyguard) to remove Ramos from the room.\n\nAnd, over the newsman\u2019s vocal objections, that\u2019s just what happened. While Ramos waited in the hallway, a Trump supporter began arguing with him and eventually told Ramos, a U.S. citizen who was born in Mexico: \u201cGo back to your country.\u201d\n\nThen, after Hunt and another reporter questioned how Trump handled the situation, the real estate developer allowed Ramos to return and ask questions. The two men bantered back and forth for the next several minutes. Before long, the conversation had run its course. That\u2019s when Trump made his comment about how the two men would be \u201ctalking a lot over the years.\u201d\n\nIronically, with his emotional hijinks, Ramos might actually have hurt his own cause. He wound up playing into every negative stereotype that Americans subscribe to about Mexicans who come uninvited across the U.S.-Mexico border. If you think Mexican immigrants are pushy rule breakers who don\u2019t wait their turn, Ramos\u2019s filibuster in Iowa only feeds that perception.\n\nNow that the altercation is over with, and each participant has had the chance to spin the events, we\u2019ve entered the final act of this telenovela.\n\nThat\u2019s where Ramos\u2014rather than submit to peer review\u2014portrays himself as the only real journalist left in North America who isn\u2019t afraid to speak truth to power. It\u2019s where, instead of apologizing for breaking the rules, he insists that all journalists should break the rules more often. It\u2019s where Ramos, in effect, demands amnesty for himself by arguing that he committed no sin.\n\nIt\u2019s also in this final act that pundits and analysts are free to speculate whether Trump\u2019s shoddy treatment of Ramos will cost the GOP frontrunner any shot he might have had to revive his support from Hispanics. A recent Gallup Poll shows Trump with a net favorability rating of minus 51 percent among Hispanics. Could Trump\u2019s dustup with Ramos make him even more unpopular with that group of voters?\n\nWait and see. Personally, I don\u2019t except many Hispanics to walk around wearing buttons that proclaim: \u201cI am Jorge.\u201d And take it from a Hispanic journalist who has been on the job for a quarter-century: I\u2019m not Jorge.\n\nHow do I know? After his confrontation with Trump, as he was trying to lecture the rest of us on how to do our jobs\u2014despite having just failed at his\u2014Ramos said this: \u201cI think it is very important that, as journalists, we challenge those who are in power.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s rich. Ramos has never challenged President Obama, Hillary Clinton and other Democrats with the same ferocity he shows when attacking Trump and Republicans. He criticizes Trump because, he says, his deportation policies could divide families.\n\nWhere\u2019s his constant criticism of Obama, whose deportation policies DID divide families?\n\nYes, as has often been noted by those who want to construct a narrative that he\u2019s nonpartisan, during the 2012 election, Ramos did gently poke at Obama about a broken promise to push for immigration reform in his first term. But there was no shouting, no charges of promoting hatred.\n\nRamos has long been compromised by the fact that his employer, Univision, has such strong ties to the Obama administration and Democrats.\n\nIn 2012, just a few months before the election, the president nominated Cheryl Saban to serve as the U.S. representative to the UN General Assembly\u2014a largely symbolic position. Cheryl is the wife of Israeli-American billionaire Haim Saban, a mega-donor to the Democratic Party who supported Clinton in 2008. He is also the owner of Univision.\n\nIn 2016, Saban is publicly backing Clinton\u2019s bid for the presidency. Univision has partnered with the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation. And, of course, as mentioned, Ramos\u2019s daughter works for Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nThose entanglements could be why one doesn\u2019t hear much talk on Ramos\u2019s Sunday political show, Al Punto, about the ever-worsening scandal involving Clinton\u2019s private email server. In the world according to Ramos, Democrats sometimes make bad decisions. But Republicans are almost always bad people.\n\nThose on the left call that common sense. Those on the right call it slander. Neither side can call it journalism.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:09.560+0000"}

Pojunis, the chairman of the Nevada Libertarian Party, stood outside his office on Flamingo Road in Las Vegas, ashing a cigarette and dissing Rand Paul. \u201cWe\u2019re the Libertarian Party,\u201d he told me, dramatically stretching out the word in his New York accent. Paul, a member of the Republican Party, was in town for a visit ahead of formally launching his bid for the White House, and Pojunis didn\u2019t particularly care.\n\n\u201cLibertarian,\u201d he said, is now just \u201ca buzzword\u201d for Republicans like the Kentucky senator. If Paul was really so libertarian, Pojunis had some advice for him: \u201cWell, OK then\u2014join the Libertarian Party!\u201d\n\nPojunis led me inside past some staffers hunched over a computer trying to select a new party logo. \u201cIs this too swastika-y?\u201d he asked, pointing to an image closely resembling the Nazi insignia. We walked past a room cluttered with memorabilia from Baywatch, the 1990s TV show featuring bikini-clad lifeguards, and Pojunis explained that it was the personal office of Michael Burke, the creator of the show and a possible Libertarian Party candidate. \u201cHe literally has a key to the Playboy Mansion,\u201d Pojunis said.\n\nAnecdotally, when I\u2019ve talked to Libertarians who identify as Paul supporters\u2014particularly those who campaigned for his father, former congressman and two-time presidential candidate Ron Paul\u2014they acknowledge the reality that Rand Paul may be the best ambassador to the mainstream political world they will ever get. In other words, the senator is not the ideal libertarian (an oxymoronic phrase, given the amount of infighting among libertarians about what exactly that is), but he comes close enough, and certainly closer than any other likely presidential candidate.\n\nBut Pojunis and his aides said those Paul supporters were fools. Libertarians who back Paul, he said, are \u201cgetting all the downside of compromise and none of the upside.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, there was little reason to think that Nevada\u2019s Libertarian Party, which is considered slightly off the rails even among fellow libertarians, represented anyone other than its own 12,000 members. But some of Paul\u2019s recent foreign policy pronouncements have some libertarians, especially those who gravitated to his father for his steadfast opposition to the war in Iraq and George W. Bush\u2019s hyper-hawkishness, sounding like Pojunis and his fellow Nevada radicals.\n\nThe breaking point came on March 9, when Paul was faced with one of the most challenging decisions of his political career.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) penned an open letter to \u201cthe leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\u201d The letter stated, rather condescendingly, that Iranian leaders \u201cdo not fully understand our constitutional system.\u201d Soon a new president would be in office, Cotton wrote, and that president could (if Republican, would) \u201crevoke\u201d any executive agreement President Obama signs.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re compromising and then you\u2019re going to lose anyway, why are you compromising to begin with? Then you lose your whole base.\u201d\n\nCotton, a neoconservative beloved by Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, one of the most influential organs that supported the invasion of Iraq, opposes U.S. engagement with Iran, and he has previously expressed a desire to halt any dialogue between the two countries over Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThe end of these negotiations isn\u2019t an unintended consequence of congressional action,\u201d Cotton told the Heritage Foundation in January. \u201cIt is very much an intended consequence. A feature, not a bug, so to speak.\u201d\n\nPaul has historically favored the negotiations Cotton seeks to stop. In 2012, he objected to new sanctions on Iran. In January, as his likely Republican primary competitors Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio warned of the threat of a nuclear Iran, Paul appeared skeptical. \u201cAre you ready to send ground troops to Iran?\u201d he asked. \u201cAre you ready to bomb them? Are you ready to send 100,000 troops? I\u2019m a big fan of trying to exert and trying the diplomatic option as long as we can. If it fails, I will vote to resume sanctions and I would vote to have new sanctions\u2026 But if you do it in the middle of negotiations, you\u2019re ruining it.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s position on Iran has always been closer to Obama\u2019s than to that of his fellow Senate Republicans\u2014until March 9, when he joined 47 of his fellow Senate Republicans in signing the letter.\n\n\u201cThis is more than a flip-flop. This is a backflip,\u201d Justin Raimondo, the editorial director of Antiwar.com, told me on Wednesday. \u201cThis was the last straw. I\u2019ve put up with a lot from that guy! I\u2019ve had to defend him like a Jesuit. I\u2019m done. Let somebody else do it.\u201d\n\nTo say Raimondo was a supporter of Paul wouldn\u2019t quite be correct. Raimondo has acted like Paul\u2019s personal bodyguard on the Internet. More often than not, any comment that could be perceived as being remotely critical of the senator was met with a response from Raimondo that was so vitriolic it veered toward cyber-bullying. (When I wrote an article in July making the case that Ron Paul might pose a political problem for Rand Paul, Raimondo called me a \u201cprofessional sleaze-ologist.\u201d Other times when he was unhappy with my coverage of Paul, he criticized my appearance.)\n\nNow Raimondo acknowledges that he was much like many of the other Paul supporters I\u2019ve spoken to: not entirely satisfied with the senator but willing to tolerate him if it meant hearing some of what Raimondo believed expressed on the national stage. \u201cI thought he was going to start a real debate about foreign policy in this country, and I thought he was a reasonably principled yet pragmatic politician,\u201d Raimondo said. \u201cAnd now, apparently he\u2019s just a panderer who would do anything to please people who hate him anyway and will continue to hate him no matter what he does\u2014even if he changes his last name.\u201d\n\nRaimondo said he believes the rarified confines of the Senate and the media spotlight Paul has been cooking under have made him lose touch with reality. \u201cHe is taking his base for granted,\u201d Raimondo complained. \u201cHere is somebody who is an eye doctor who is suddenly elevated to the Senate. It\u2019s turned him into kind of a megalomaniac.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s counting on the organizational muscle of the Ron Paul groups like the Campaign for Liberty [and] Young Americans for Liberty\u2014but these are libertarians! They don\u2019t take orders from the central committee! It\u2019s like herding cats anyway,\u201d Raimondo said.\n\nThe senator claimed he signed the letter to help Obama position himself better during negotiations and to reinforce his position that Congress should have the final say over whether such an agreement with Iran is made. (Paul is a co-sponsor of the so-called Corker bill, which would give Congress the opportunity to vote on the matter.) Paul\u2019s explanation, of course, ignores Cotton\u2019s stated objectives: to kill those negotiations; and to remind the Obama administration that what it does doesn\u2019t matter, because when a new, Republican administration struts into office, it will just undo it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s curious,\u201d Christopher Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said of Paul\u2019s decision. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain level of disappointment and surprise,\u201d he said, but \u201cit\u2019s not unique to libertarians.\u201d The letter as a whole \u201creveals within the party kind of a departure of the wise and prudent foreign policy of, say, the George Bush 41 administration.\u201d (Paul often cites George H.W. Bush as a major inspiration for his own foreign policy.) Overall, Preblo said, the Iran letter is \u201cjust sort of embarrassing.\u201d\n\nRaimondo suggested that Paul\u2019s decision wasn\u2019t just vaguely related to 2016 but to the support of one influential donor in particular: \u201cI don\u2019t want to imply anything,\u201d he said, but, \u201cprior to this, he did meet with Sheldon Adelson\u2026\u201d\n\nOn March 4, Paul had a private meeting with the Las Vegas-based casino billionaire, who was visiting Washington to attend the congressional address by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of whom Adelson is a fervent supporter. Adelson\u2019s hobby is toying with presidential politics: During the 2012 election, he spent $93 million on super PACs. His financial backing is so vital that he once got the tough-talking Chris Christie to apologize for offending him at a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition. (The New Jersey governor had referred to \u201cthe occupied territories,\u201d a widely used term for the Palestinian areas of the West Bank that are under Israeli control but one that Adelson finds offensive.) It was not helpful to Paul when The New York Times reported that Adelson was so turned off by Paul\u2019s foreign policy views that he told his associates he might finance a campaign to defeat Paul if the senator catches fire in the Republican primaries. After the early March meeting, Paul assured a Jewish radio program that rumors of Adelson\u2019s hatred of him were untrue.\n\nI asked Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to Paul, whether the meeting with Adelson had any impact on Paul\u2019s decision to sign the letter five days later. \u201cNo,\u201d Stafford insisted. \u201cWhat impacted his decision to sign the letter was he felt it reinforced his co-sponsorship of the Corker bill.\u201d\n\nStafford maintained that Paul hadn\u2019t flip-flopped or back-flipped. \u201cRand\u2019s foreign policy doesn\u2019t fit in boxes,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to label him as something, people want to put him in boxes, they try to assign these things. He just doesn\u2019t fit them.\u201d\n\nJack Hunter, a reliable Paul defender and co-author of his first book, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with him signing the letter. I guess he has his reasons.\u201d He acknowledged the letter was \u201cperhaps\u201d a departure from the senator\u2019s pro-negotiation position.\n\nWhatever nonsensical thing Paul may say about why he signed the letter, it\u2019s probably true that neglecting to do so would have had serious repercussions in the Republican presidential primary campaign. \u201cIt would be very difficult for any of the candidates to avoid signing onto it,\u201d said Rick Wilson, a Republican consultant. \u201cEven somebody like Paul, who knows his dad\u2019s lists are still going to fund a lot of his operation,\u201d Wilson said, knows \u201cit\u2019s a political reality that no one in the Republican Party right now is going to bless\u201d the Obama administration\u2019s position on Iran. Wilson said the debate over the letter would soon pass. \u201cI think the brouhaha is completely centered in the Acela corridor. It\u2019s a media frenzy. This is a D.C.-New York bullshit, circle-jerk process story.\u201d\n\nBullshit or not, it feels like the Nevada Libertarians were onto something back in January when they warned that Paul\u2019s shape-shifting positions, often too subtle to be branded flip-flopping but nonetheless unsettling to hardcore supporters, would ultimately nudge his libertarian base into a depressive state. \u201cIt sounds reasonable [to compromise] in order to win,\u201d said Jason Weinman, the party\u2019s outreach director. \u201cBut if you\u2019re compromising and then you\u2019re going to lose anyway, why are you compromising to begin with?

On Twitter, Jones urged his constituents to tattle on potential violators.\n\n\u201cWe will b [sic] watching you. From the dark to light,\u201d vowed the mustachioed crimefighter, who once suggested tracking immigrants like UPS packages.\n\nJones has long terrified his county\u2019s Hispanic residents. In 2006, he commissioned a series of billboards alerting citizens, \u201cHire an illegal. Break the law!\u201d and posted an \u201cillegal aliens here\u201d street sign, with an arrow pointing toward the jail. The rabble-rousing cop also launched a boycott of businesses accused of hiring undocumented workers.\n\nLast year, he made headlines for sending a bill to Mexico\u2019s president demanding a $900,000 reimbursement for 3,000 Mexican nationals held in Butler County\u2019s jail over a decade\u2014a gambit that reportedly put him on a drug cartel hit list.\n\nThe sheriff admits to being as relentless on immigration as Trump, whose incendiary warnings of Mexican \u201crapists,\u201d diseased immigrants and \u201canchor babies\u201d have only bolstered his conservative fan base.\n\nJones\u2019s rhetoric was enough to get Team Trump\u2019s attention. After Jones issued a press release last month supporting the GOP blowhard\u2019s tough stance, Trump\u2019s people contacted him to discuss setting up a meeting.\n\n\u201cPeople are fired up,\u201d Jones told The Daily Beast, adding that Trump is giving \u201ca voice to all of us out there that have been crying and begging for help.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou would think Ohio... wouldn\u2019t have an illegal immigrant problem, but we do,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIn this county, we\u2019ve had people killed, molested by illegals. Not thousands of them, but just one is too much. Our governor and elected officials do nothing.\u201d\n\nJones said that within five minutes of announcing his initiative on social media, a citizen called the sheriff\u2019s office with a tip.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a builder, a contractor\u2026 I can\u2019t enforce federal law, but I can enforce state law,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re lying and cheating so you can hire these people\u2026 and it\u2019s state paperwork, it is a violation and you will be charged.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to focus on\u2026 anything to do with illegals who are committing crimes,\u201d added Jones, whose 160 officers patrol the 360,000-population county, which is between Cincinnati and Dayton.\n\nThe sheriff\u2014who last fall got The Daily Show treatment for claiming illegal immigrants receive free computers and car payments\u2014went on to accuse migrants of taking jobs from legal residents.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t find dishwashers here, or people to bus tables, landscapers\u2014it all used to be done with local people,\u201d Jones said. \u201c[The jobs] have all been taken over by illegals. Drywallers, bricklayers. They\u2019ve taken away jobs.\u201d\n\nStill, Jones claims he declined an invitation to fly to New York to meet Trump. He\u2019d rather the billionaire candidate visit Ohio. \u201cI\u2019ve got some things I want to communicate with him,\u201d Jones told The Daily Beast. \u201cI want to look him in the eyeballs. Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll get the opportunity, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been criticized, I\u2019ve been called a racist, a bigot for using the words \u2018illegal aliens, anchor babies,\u2019 blah, blah, blah.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI want to talk to him about immigration, about drugs, about heroin [coming from across the border]. I\u2019ve got 15 sheriffs that want to meet with him in Ohio, maybe more. That\u2019s quite a few.\u201d\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Jones\u2019s love for Trump could blossom into an alliance. Despite his many pro-Trump Twitter posts, Jones said he hasn\u2019t officially endorsed The Donald. When asked about Trump\u2019s use of pejorative terms like \u201canchor babies,\u201d Jones went to bat.\n\n\u201cI use the term \u2018anchor babies,\u2019\u201d Jones told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m not ashamed of it. I\u2019m not afraid of it. I talk tough and call it like it is, and I get 80 percent of the vote every time I run. I knew [Trump] would do well before he did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been criticized, I\u2019ve been called a racist, a bigot for using the words \u2018illegal aliens, anchor babies,\u2019 blah, blah, blah,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHey, sorry that it offends you. But that\u2019s what I said and I\u2019m sticking to my word. I won\u2019t apologize\u2026 period.\u201d\n\nImmigration activists don\u2019t take Jones\u2019s comments lightly.\n\nLast summer, 40 people, including children of men who were deported, protested outside his office. \u201c[Jones has] made it clear he doesn\u2019t care about illegals,\u201d one protester told a local TV station. \u201cA lot of people feel his reasoning is wrong and feel it\u2019s backed by racism.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, six young demonstrators from North Carolina were arrested after they chained themselves together and blocked the entrance to the county jail, which is one of a few in Ohio that houses illegal immigrants for the federal government.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:10.161+0000"}
{"entityId": 1558, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Wisconsin governor\u2019s years of questionable ads, campaign finance trouble, and multiple investigations haven\u2019t taken him down at home yet. But what will 2016 voters think?\n\nIt has been more than a decade, but when David Riemer talks about Scott Walker, his voice still shakes with anger and exasperation.\n\n\u201cHe thinks that God is on his side and so that gives him the right to lie, to dodge, to make promises and not keep them,\u201d said Riemer, now a senior fellow a the Community Advocates Public Policy Institute, a think tank dedicated to reducing poverty in Wisconsin.\n\nBack in 2004, Riemer ran against Walker, then a first-term county executive of Milwaukee who had ridden into office on the back of a pension scandal, pledging that any of his office\u2019s hires would sign a waiver forgoing recently enacted lavish benefits and sweeteners.\n\nRiemer, an adviser to two Wisconsin governors and a former budget director of the city of Milwaukee, filed an open-records request in an effort find out if that promise had been kept. Turns out, it hadn\u2019t; in response to the open-records request, a handful of top staffers hastily added their name to a list stating that they had signed the waiver. The list didn\u2019t have a date on it, though, and wasn\u2019t an official waiver anyway, merely a piece of paper indicating that signatories had signed a wavier previously.\n\nIn a letter to the attorney general\u2019s office after the election, and after Walker\u2019s office had eventually complied with the open-records request, Riemer wrote that Walker\u2019s intention had been \u201cto fool me, as Mr. Walker\u2019s primary opponent in the political campaign for County Executive; to fool the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel; and to fool the voters and the public. The deception worked. We were all fooled.\u201d\n\nThe attorney general declined to prosecute but accused Walker of \u201cchicanery.\u201d\n\nAnd that was not all.\n\nIn the course of the campaign, Walker\u2019s team ran a radio ad accusing Riemer of engineering a pension settlement to a series of lawsuits that cost the county millions of dollars. In fact, the lawsuits predated Riemer\u2019s tenure with the county, and his reforms helped save the city up to $25 million a year. When pressed, according to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, Walker conceded that \u201cthe ad\u2019s assertion is not correct as stated,\u201d but he refused to stop running it.\n\n\u201cI have never in my life seen anything like it,\u201d Riemer, who ended up losing the election by nearly 15 percentage points, said. \u201cWhat kind of person admits that what they are doing is wrong but won\u2019t change it? There is a fundamental character flaw here.\u201d\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t believe what a jerk he was. I was new to politics. I didn\u2019t think it was fair game for them to say anything about you whether it was provable or not.\u201d\n\nWalker is now on the cusp of announcing a run for president, and early polls show him as a front-runner to become the Republican nominee. And part of his appeal to the Republican faithful is his record of success in political campaigns and in public office. This is someone, after all, who won four consecutive terms in the state legislature before winning three county executive races in the Democratic-leaning Milwaukee County and three races for governor in blue-hued Wisconsin. He also became the first governor in American history to survive a recall. And unlike some Republicans in Democratic territory who hew to the center after Election Day, Walker tacked sharply to the right while in office, winning him plaudits from conservative leaders as a true believer.\n\nBut longtime Walker-watchers in Wisconsin say that behind Walker\u2019s success is a long record of bending campaign laws just to their breaking point.\n\n\u201cScott Walker is politics incarnate, with an unslakable thirst for political power and an eye on the next election,\u201d said Mike Browne, the deputy director of One Wisconsin Now, a liberal advocacy group. \u201cThroughout his nearly quarter-century career running for office, he\u2019s shown he\u2019ll do whatever he thinks he needs to do to win, letter or spirit of the laws be damned.\u201d\n\nMost notably, Walker has been ensnared in a pair of so-called John Doe investigations. In the first, while looking into missing funds from a veterans\u2019 charity run out of Walker\u2019s county executive office, investigators discovered that his staff had set up a secretive Internet system in his government office to allow them to do political work on the taxpayer\u2019s dime. Investigators also found that a railroad executive with business before the state had set up a straw donor scheme enabling his employees to donate to the future governor.\n\nThe investigation didn\u2019t touch Walker, but a deputy chief of staff was sentenced to six months in jail. Another was convicted of embezzlement after it was discovered that he used funds stolen from the veterans\u2019 charity to set up Walker for Governor campaign websites. Another top staffer received one year of probation and a $1,000 fine after cooperating with investigators.\n\nThe second John Doe investigation is ongoing and focuses on whether Walker\u2019s campaign illegally coordinated with the Club for Growth during his 2012 recall campaign. According to heavily redacted documents released last week, Walker\u2019s defense argues that such coordination was not illegal because Walker was not an official candidate until April of that year\u2014a mere two months before voters went to the polls and while Walker was raising and spending millions of dollars to ward off his Democratic opponent.\n\nWalker\u2019s trouble with campaign rules began even before he embarked on a political career in earnest. As a sophomore at Marquette University in Milwaukee, he lost a bid for student body president in a race that was marred by allegations that Walker improperly campaigned before officially registering his campaign, that he failed to properly register his campaign workers, and that he went door-to-door to hand out fliers in violation of campus policy. More seriously, after the school paper endorsed Walker\u2019s opponent, stacks of newspapers went missing, and the Walker operation was accused of engineering the theft.\n\nWalker dropped out of Marquette just before he was set to graduate and promptly mounted a campaign against Gwen Moore, a one-term state assemblywoman. In an interview, Moore, now a member of Congress, said her Republican colleagues at the time told her that the reason Walker was running was that even though the district was majority Democratic, \u201cthe majority voting-age population was white.\n\n\u201cHe would say his hero was Ronald Reagan. Lee Atwater, Ronald Reagan, that was the regime he looked up to, and he ran a perfect racial dog whistle campaign,\u201d Moore said.\n\nThe campaign literature, she recalled, featured \u201cguns, gangs, drugs, and urban unrest.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cried,\u201d she said. \u201cI thought I was being associated with the worst elements of the community. I couldn\u2019t believe what a jerk he was. I was new to politics. I didn\u2019t think it was fair game for them to say anything about you whether it was provable or not.\u201d\n\nWalker lost decisively, moved to a new district, and served nearly a decade in the legislature before running for county executive. While in office, he was repeatedly dogged by failures to properly file campaign finance reports, including leaving off the occupation of more than 50 donors who gave more than $100 in violation of state laws.\n\nFailure to list a donor\u2019s occupation is a problem that Walker\u2019s numerous campaigns have encountered frequently. When he first explored a run for governor in 2006, the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonpartisan watchdog group that pushes for clean elections, found that 114 donations totaling more than $75,000 failed to list the occupation or employer. In 2008, Walker\u2019s office stopped filing its campaign finance reports electronically, which made life harder for watchdogs, but still in 2009, One Wisconsin Now found that $170,000 worth of contributions were not listed properly, including two contributions of $10,000, the maximum amount allowed by law. The next year, the group found that more than $500,000 in contributions was improperly reported.\n\nIn 2005, two Democratic county supervisors filed an ethics complaint with the elections board against Walker for using his campaign arm, Friends of Scott Walker, to robo-call against them on behalf of his budget without disclosing who was beyond the calls.\n\nThe elections board ended up fining Walker $5,000, then the second-largest such fine in state history.\n\nBut it was not the first time Walker\u2019s name would appear before the state elections board. Since 2010, when he first began exploring a gubernatorial run in earnest, the state Democratic Party has filed seven ethics complaints against him.\n\nThe earliest cites a series of motorcycle rides Walker would take around the state while county executive, ostensibly to promote tourism to Milwaukee but which critics said was little more than a way for Walker to introduce himself to voters around the state (or beyond\u2014Walker twice traveled to Minnesota on his annual Harley ride and once to the early caucus state of Iowa).\n\nTwice the ride was sponsored by AirTran Airways, a low-cost air carrier that at the time had a request pending before the county commission for concourse space at the Milwaukee airport. The sponsorship led critics to accuse the candidate of extracting an in-kind donation from a corporation. According to the complaint, \u201cIt was not Milwaukee County logos\u2026that lavished and marked everyone of the three dozen stops on the tour. It was signs, flags and standards of Air Tran that dominated every single venue on Walker\u2019s tour.\u201d\n\nThe claim that the trip was just for Walker to promote Walker and not Milwaukee County was given credence, the complaint alleges, when in 2010 it was rescheduled to coincide with the date and location of the state Republican convention, allowing Walker to roar in to the convention on the back of his Harley. Plus, the complaint notes that Walker was accompanied by Tim Russell, a longtime Walker insider\u2014and the one who ended up going to prison for stealing from the veterans\u2019 charity\u2014who frequently moved between campaign and governmental positions. At the time of the 2010 ride, Russell was the administrator of the county\u2019s housing department.\n\n\u201cAny reasonable person would conclude that Housing has nothing to do with tourism\u2014Russell\u2019s presence indicates that the ride was in fact illegal campaign activity,\u201d the complaint states.\n\nAnother complaint alleges that right-wing outside groups like the Koch brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity were illegally coordinating with Walker\u2019s recall campaign. The CEO of one such group, the Bradley Foundation, was Walker\u2019s campaign chairman, and the chairman of the board of the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, a conservative think tank, had given $16,500 to Walker\u2019s various campaigns.\n\nA third complaint asks the Government Accountability Board to look into Walker\u2019s legal defense fund, one that he has poured $60,000 of his campaign money into, though state law says such funds can be used only for a candidate or public official who is being investigated or who has an agent who is being investigated. Walker has denied repeatedly that he is a target of the John Doe investigation.\n\nA fourth complaint alleges that in the spring of his recall campaign, in the wake of a federal Bureau of Labor Statistics release that showed that Wisconsin was the only state to post \u201cstatistically significant\u201d job losses in the previous 12 months, the Walker administration expedited the release of its own jobs figures, which used a different metric from the widely used BLS metric. Walker\u2019s numbers showed that the state added jobs, and moments after releasing the numbers, his recall campaign launched a blitz of television and radio ads touting them\u2014proof, the complaint alleges, of coordination between the government and political side of Walker\u2019s office.\n\nA fifth complaint, filed just this year, accuses Walker of dissembling when he claimed that his recent trip to the United Kingdom was for official business and used public funds to promote trade between Wisconsin and the U.K. The visit was widely seen as a chance for Walker to bolster his foreign policy credentials, and Walker refused to answer media questions while in the United Kingdom.\n\nAccording to a Democratic Party official, five of the complaints are still pending. Two more were dismissed. One alleged that Walker brought Republican super pollster Frank Luntz into the state capitol during the protests against the governor\u2019s efforts to end collective bargaining for public employees in the state. Another alleged that Walker tried to coordinate with the Koch brothers directly by discussing by phone how he was handling the protesters, including planting \u201ctroublemakers\u201d within their midst. (That call turned out to be a prank.)\n\n\u201cThe blatant disregard for campaign finance and ethics laws we\u2019ve seen from Scott Walker over the entirety of his career in elected office is unprecedented in Wisconsin politics,\u201d said Melissa Baldauff, communications director for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. \u201cNever before has a Wisconsin governor required a criminal defense fund, the donors to which still haven\u2019t been disclosed, or been alleged by prosecutors to be at the center of a nationwide \u2018criminal scheme.\u2019\"\n\nIn a statement, Kirsten Kukowski, a spokeswoman for the governor, said, \u201cGovernor Walker has championed big, bold reforms that the left clearly doesn\u2019t like, but he\u2019s won three times in four years because of his results for the people of Wisconsin.\u201d\n\nFew in Wisconsin think Walker will somehow be brought down by any of the complaints. To the exasperation of state Democrats, none of these allegations seem to have much slowed his steady ascent through the political ranks. Now that he is running for president, Walker finds himself facing a new set of campaign finance regulations.\n\nIn a presidential campaign, many would-be candidates who are exploring a run take great pains not to admit that they are candidates for office. To do so would mean that they could run afoul of fundraising laws that forbid coordination between candidates and the outside groups supporting them. Jeb Bush, for example, has dismissed questions about what he would do as president by noting that he is not yet a candidate and wouldn\u2019t want to suddenly trigger a campaign. When he did acknowledge that he was running, Bush promptly backtracked.\n\nWalker has no such apparent qualms, referring to himself several times as \u201ca candidate\u201d and talking about how his sons may take time off from college to campaign with him, even though no such campaign officially exists.\n\nDemocrats have filed complaints to the Federal Election Commission.

Really.\n\nKim Kardashian has endorsed Hillary Clinton. Being a Kardashian, she has done so with a selfie.\n\nWhen asked recently if she thinks Clinton should be America\u2019s first female president, she enthusiastically replied, \u201cI hope so!\u201d And on the night of the first 2016 Republican presidential debate, Kardashian (featuring Kanye) had the opportunity to fan-girl all over Hillary\u2014\u201cour next President,\u201d as Kim would say.\n\n(Clinton reportedly broke protocol in order to achieve that power-selfie.)\n\nIt does make sense that the reality-TV star/socialite would be Ready for Hillary. Kardashian is liberal, having evolved from her previous stance as a self-identified \u201cliberal Republican\u201d a few years back. She sided with the Democrats in the last midterm elections, and supports President Obama.\n\nHowever, there is one important caveat to Kardashian\u2019s endorsement. During her time as Secretary of State, Clinton had used her power and influence to work against the very political cause about which Kardashian is most passionate: recognition of the Armenian genocide, during which the Ottoman government killed more than 1 million souls during and after World War I.\n\nEarlier this year, Kardashian\u2014herself of Armenian descent\u2014traveled to Armenia just before the 100th anniversary of the mass slaughter to get in touch with her roots and to visit the genocide memorial in Yerevan. Prime Minister Hovik Abrahamyan personally received her and her family, and praised her for aiding in the \u201cinternational recognition and condemnation of the Armenian genocide.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happened before Rwanda, Darfur, and the Holocaust,\u201d Kardashian blogged in a post slamming the Turkish government for genocide denial in 2011. \u201cMaybe none of those other genocides would have happened if more nations had condemned the Armenian Genocide, when 1.5 million Armenians were massacred.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s track record as a senator on this subject would be agreeable to someone with Kardashian\u2019s views. During her 2008 campaign, she issued a statement boasting that \u201calone among the [2008] presidential candidates, I have been a long-standing supporter of the Armenian Genocide Resolution.\u201d\n\nBut after she landed the job of Secretary of State in the Obama administration, international politics and diplomacy started getting in the way. Secretary Clinton, unlike Sen. Clinton, stopped tossing out the term \u201cgenocide\u201d when discussing the matter in public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shift that illustrates the difficulty Clinton faced balancing the interests of the Turks and collective memory,\u201d Taylor Wofford reported in Newsweek in April. \u201cClinton needed to woo Turkey, a U.S. ally and fellow NATO member, on issues ranging from the Iraq War to interdicting drug trafficking to pushing back against Vladimir Putin. And, historically, nothing has riled the Turks quite like calling what happened between 1915 and 1917 a genocide.\u201d\n\nWhen the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide in 2010, Secretary Clinton voiced her opposition.\n\n\u201cThe Obama administration strongly opposes the resolution that was passed by only one vote in the House committee and will work very hard to make sure it does not go to the House floor,\u201d she said. (It did not make it to the House floor.)\n\nStill, Clinton\u2019s position during her time at the State Department may not have dampened Kardashian\u2019s support all that much. After all, she has been a dedicated Obama supporter, even as she called him out over the issue. \u201cI would like President Obama to use the word genocide,\u201d she wrote in a Time op-ed published last April. \u201cIt\u2019s very disappointing he hasn\u2019t used it as President. We thought it was going to happen this year. I feel like we\u2019re close\u2014but we\u2019re definitely moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nPerhaps she\u2019ll have more luck if Hillary is elected. Certainly, 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\u2019s position appears to be back in line with her position in the Senate and on the \u201908 campaign trail. \u201cHillary Clinton has a record of expressing her own view that this was a genocide,\u201d a Clinton aide told Newsweek. \u201cShe also has a record of promoting reconciliation between Turkey and Armenia and as secretary of state she personally worked to advance that goal.\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s representative did not respond to a request for comment.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:10.922+0000"}

It\u2019s sandwiched between Fort Lauderdale and Miami, a cramped seaside waiting room populated by condominiums, motels, personal injury attorneys, and pawnshops. But funnily enough, Hollywood is where I happened to be when I read \u201cIDEA 90\u201d on Wednesday.\n\nIt does seem unlikely that if Rubio were to have succeeded in building his own Hollywood in Florida, he could have avoided doing it anywhere except Hollywood, Florida. Where else was he going to build it, Tallahassee? Then you\u2019d have Hollywood, Florida, and Tallahassee, Florida (now with more Hollywood!). It would get confusing. He would have had to spend a lot of taxpayer funds reissuing maps. I asked Rubio\u2019s campaign about this issue and received no response.\n\nAnyhow, the \u201cIDEA 90\u201d chapter begins, like all chapters should, with a quotation from George W. Bush: \u201cIn this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.\u201d\n\nThe film industry, Rubio explains, is a large part of Florida\u2019s economy, with $372 million in wages to Florida workers in 2001 coming from motion picture production. But, Rubio laments, \u201cin the past two years, not one commercial or music video has qualified for Florida\u2019s film incentive.\u201d\n\nTo remedy the problem, Rubio suggests that \u201cFlorida should create a tax incentive program aimed at attracting more film productions and TV series to the state, with a priority given to those productions that are given \u2018family-friendly\u2019 ratings such as G or PG.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked Rubio\u2019s campaign for a more comprehensive definition of the senator\u2019s view of \u201cfamily friendly,\u201d his spokesman, Alex Conant, responded, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know what you're referring to.\u201d\n\nIn April, TMZ asked Rubio what kind of music he likes. The senator called himself \u201ca Nicki Minaj fan.\u201d That\u2019d be the Nicki Minaj who famously rapped \u201cReal country a-- n---a, let me play with his rifle; P---y put his a-- to sleep, now he calling me NyQuil.\u201d\n\nSo perhaps the senator\u2019s definition of family friendly is somewhat broader than the reaction to his tax incentive proposal in Florida may have suggested.\n\nThe \u201cfamily friendly\u201d tax credits started being issued a year after Rubio\u2019s book came out, in 2007. In 2010, a $75 million tax incentive proposal made its way to the floor of the legislature, and the measure included within it a provision prohibiting tax credits for productions with \u201cnontraditional family values.\u201d\n\nWould a President Rubio seek to reward people producing \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment with tax breaks and let those who produce whatever the opposite of \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment is fend for themselves?\n\nAccording to The Palm Beach Post, \u201cmovies and TV shows with gay characters\u201d could be refused the tax credit, as there was no comprehensive definition for what \u201cnontraditional family values\u201d meant in the text of the bill.\n\nThe executive director for Florida Together, a coalition of equal-rights groups in the state, told the publication, \u201cInstituting 1950s-style movie censorship does nothing to support real-life families or help Florida\u2019s struggling economy.\u201d\n\nI asked Rubio\u2019s campaign if as president he would similarly seek to reward people producing \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment with tax breaks and let those who produce whatever the opposite of \u201cfamily friendly\u201d entertainment is fend for themselves. My inquiry received no response.\n\nWhile campaigning for the Senate, Rubio claimed that 57 of his 100 Innovative Ideas were turned into law by the legislature, a claim PolitiFact found to be \u201chalf-true\u201d\u2014the site\u2019s diplomatic way of saying someone lied. Twenty-four ideas, according to PolitiFact\u2019s research, became law and 10 are in \u201cstate law books\u201d but are not technically law.\n\nI asked Rubio\u2019s campaign whether the senator was still claiming that 57 of his ideas became law during his time in the legislature.

She is an award-winning actress, singer, and philanthropist. Much like many other celebrities living today, she also tweets\u2014and oftentimes those tweets turn to politics, history, and war.\n\nOver the long Memorial Day weekend, Cher took to Twitter to sharply criticize Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter for blaming Iraqi forces\u2019 lack of will for ISIS\u2019s recent victory in Ramadi.\n\n\u201cAsh Carter Says \u2018IRAQI ARMY LACKS WILL [TO] FIGHT\u2019 YA THINK,\u201d Cher wrote, before posting an emoji of a face crying from vigorous laughter. \u201cSpend [money] REALLY Arming The Kurds.

Bush \u201calmost killed [her],\u201d and she has said many times that she doesn\u2019t understand why any woman or member of a minority group would ever vote Republican.\n\nOne of the issues she is most passionate about is U.S. military veterans, and the treatment of injured and maimed troops returning home.

{"entityId": 1562, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A proposed FCC rule change could reach too far and put polling out of business. Good, you say? No\u2014polling is good for democracy.\n\nThere is no rest, no retreat, no escape. There is only the bombardment.\n\nThe junk mail can be pitched. The TV ads can be skipped on the DVR. But until now, there\u2019s been no way for people with landline phones to avoid the noisy, invasive onslaught of robocalls from marketers.\n\nThe FCC is about to change all that, with a new proposal that the commission approved last week that would place greater restrictions on those calling voters and consumers, particularly using technology to automatically dial phone numbers.\n\nBut in the process, the FCC\u2019s very broad ruling could have dire consequences for pollsters and researchers eager to ask people what\u2019s on their mind, as well as the campaign organizers and analysts who specialize in targeting and turning out the vote. And while polls are often a good punching bag for those who loathe politics, their evaporation would have even worse consequences for our nation\u2019s democracy.\n\nAt first glance, to those who aren\u2019t pollsters like me, the ruling would appear to have little downside. Shutting down polling calls is a feature, not a bug, of the plan. Particularly for those poor souls living in swing states, the idea that the phone won\u2019t be constantly ringing off the hook seems like sweet relief. Is anyone really losing out if consumers get a way to shut those annoying robocalls down completely?\n\nTo understand what\u2019s going on, and to see how this ruling could affect far more than just robocalls, it is important to know the history behind the laws that govern pollsters and researchers.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act took aim at the emerging world of cellphones and put strict boundaries in place for how marketers and researchers could call them. The law prohibited the use of automated dialing technology to reach cellphone numbers.\n\nOne of the dissenting commissioners noted that the new rule could wind up prohibiting anything more advanced than a rotary phone.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t a huge deal for pollsters back in the 1990s and even into the 2000s, as the percentage of Americans who weren\u2019t reachable by landline was very small. But as more and more people turn to having only a cellphone, this has made traditional polling more and more expensive each year, because a higher proportion of the phone numbers have to be dialed by hand, by law.\n\nOn the other hand, however, automated \u201crobopolls\u201d have also exploded in popularity in recent years, despite being able to survey only voters who have landlines. Even top-notch, data-driven campaign operations like Barack Obama\u2019s in 2012 rely on much of that technology to cost-effectively survey thousands upon thousands of voters to build their predictive models.\n\nIn the past, new restrictions intended to protect consumers, like the Do Not Call list, have created exemptions for legitimate research purposes. FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has said that, in this case, he doesn\u2019t view polling as being worthy of such a carve-out. And while the precise language of the FCC\u2019s rule is not yet set in stone, the expected impact would seriously limit both traditional and \u201crobo\u201d methods of polling.\n\nFor your traditional, live-interviewer-asking-questions type of poll, considered by many to be the gold standard, now that every phone number will have to be dialed by hand lest it be blocked, it will cost significantly more to conduct a good, quality telephone poll (to the tune of three times as much, tens of thousands of dollars). This makes it far less likely that candidates or media organizations will be able to do polling or at least do it well. And as for robopolls, well, once everyone can just shut them off, it\u2019s hard to see them surviving or remaining at all credible.\n\nIt\u2019s fashionable to hate on polls while at the same time being a voracious consumer of them. But polls are, in many ways, a potentially moderating force in our politics; the same Member of Congress who gets yelled at in a town hall by a handful of anti-immigration activists, or whose office gets bombarded with a coordinated wave of activist calls, can be forgiven for thinking that\u2019s what most of his or her district thinks, absent any research to show him otherwise. In this way, polls help \u201caverage voters\u201d have a voice that counts in between elections.\n\nAnd pollsters aren\u2019t the only ones who will be affected in politics. Volunteers who want to place \u201cGet Out The Vote\u201d calls are about to have a much tougher go of it, as the FCC\u2019s rules restrict technology that could be used to auto-dial. (One of the dissenting commissioners noted that the new rule could wind up prohibiting anything more advanced than a rotary phone.) We may hate polls, but going to volunteer for a candidate and encouraging your fellow citizens to get to the polls is a much more sympathetic activity, and it too could be seriously limited by the ruling.\n\nIf it comes to pass, you won\u2019t see me mourning the death of the robopoll for too long. The upside, of course, is that there will be a huge incentive to build innovative, reliable online research tools at an even faster pace. In the end, this ruling could push polling to \u201cevolve or die\u201d a lot faster than it would have otherwise, and might take some of the less reputable polls out of the mix.\n\nThe FCC just might be killing off phone polling as we know it. But don\u2019t worry, campaign volunteers! You can find rotary phones on eBay for pretty cheap.

{"entityId": 1563, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Inside the plan to drag the presumptive Democratic nominee to the populist left.\n\nDuring the Iowa State Fair in the lead-up to the 2012 elections, members of the grassroots Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement Action Fund bird-dogged leading Republican candidates like Mitt Romney. When Romney suggested he didn\u2019t want to raise taxes on people, the Iowa community leaders challenged that he should raise taxes on corporations. \u201cCorporations are people, my friend,\u201d Romney infamously announced. The Republican candidate never lived down that incident or its message.\n\nIt is a sign of the times that the same group will be bird-dogging Republican candidates and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in the lead-up to the 2016 caucuses.\n\nAlthough Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement\u2019s political arm gave President Obama little to no flak during the 2012 election and enthusiastically backed him 2008, they\u2019ve set their sights on his former Secretary of State. It\u2019s a reflection of how dubious progressive activists are of Hillary Clinton and her ideology. But it\u2019s also a reflection of the evolution of the populist wing of the Democratic Party, a force that will finally rear its full head\u2014and wield its full influence\u2014in the 2016 elections. Imagine a Tea Party of the left, but more politically popular and strategically patient.\n\nDemocratic populism did not spring spontaneously from the well of Elizabeth Warren\u2019s consciousness. It has been brewing and building for decades. At a meeting this past weekend of the National People\u2019s Action Fund, a national network of grassroots political organizations, almost a thousand community activists from key states across the nation gathered to plan their strategy for pushing a populist agenda in 2016. And more than perhaps ever before, it\u2019s a strategy that will include attacking Democrats on a scale the party\u2019s establishment clearly fears.\n\n\u201cThere are a number of building blocks that have been put in place to create an independent political movement on the left,\u201d George Goehl, executive director of National People\u2019s Action Campaign, told me over the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s been coming together over the last few years and is positioned for takeoff in 2016.\u201d\n\nThe most recent example of this new era is in Chicago. There, Mayor Rahm Emanuel\u2014literally a founding father of modern Democratic centrism and a golden boy of the party establishment\u2014was forced into the city\u2019s first-ever mayoral run-off election by a relatively unknown challenger. Emanuel spent almost four times more on the election than his populist challenger Jesus \u201cChuy\u201d Garcia and still only won by 11 points. Meanwhile, although Emanuel allies set up a PAC specifically to target and defeat progressive candidates in the city\u2019s alderman races, the grassroots populist \u201cReclaim Chicago\u201d effort elected 10 progressive aldermen and actually grew the progressive caucus coming out of the election.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t see any candidate who is going to go toe to toe with corporate power and standing up for everyday people.\u201d\n\nWhat happened in Chicago, says Toby Chow, chair of The People\u2019s Lobby in the city, \u201csends a big statement about where politics is headed in Chicago and the rest of the country.\u201d And it sends a big warning to the Democratic establishment.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for the grassroots groups in Chicago? In addition to continuing to run and elect their own progressive candidates down-ballot, The People\u2019s Lobby and others are planning trips to Iowa to question Republicans and Democrats.\n\nThese grassroots organizations are the same groups that put populism on the political agenda in the first place, organizing against predatory lending and big bank bailouts and pushing for affordable housing and an increase in the minimum wage. \u201cThe movement was looking for leadership,\u201d says Goehl, acknowledging Elizabeth Warren as an important figurehead. \u201cWarren stands for a number of ideas, but not all of them.\u201d\n\nAnd now that these groups have helped change the national conversation, they want action. \u201cPeople don\u2019t see any candidate who is going to go toe to toe with corporate power and standing up for everyday people. They don\u2019t see a candidate who is saying what they\u2019ll do about structural racism in America,\u201d Goehl says.\n\nIt\u2019s great that candidates from Rubio to Paul to Clinton are talking about inequality. \u201cNow what are they going to do about it,\u201d asks Goehl, \u201cbeyond making our lives a little less worse?\u201d Inequality, the power of the very rich over everyone else, the abuse of corporate power\u2014these are massive problems that demand massive reforms. And Goehl\u2019s network will be pressing all the candidates\u2014including or perhaps especially the Wall Street-cozy Hillary Clinton\u2014to make clear to voters what they believe and which side they\u2019re on.\n\nLast week, as low-wage workers protested across the United States demanding a $15-an-hour wage, Hillary Clinton tweeted a message suggesting she supports the Fight for $15 movement\u2019s demands. Yet it was Men\u2019s Warehouse founder and former CEO George Zimmer who commented regarding the protests, \u201cI think that capitalism needs some modifications if it\u2019s going to remain sustainable.\u201d\n\nGoehl laughed at this. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem when the Men\u2019s Warehouse guy is more out in front than the supposed Democratic front-runner,\u201d Goehl said.\n\nThe mood of times and the economic realities the nation faces call for a president who has a populist plan, not just a plan to appease populists. And if Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t come to that realization on her own, grassroots organizing groups are finally poised to forcefully yank Clinton in the right\u2014which is to say left\u2014direction.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:12.355+0000"}

{"entityId": 1565, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "What you need to do if you don\u2019t want all your secrets blasted around the Internet.\n\nRecently, I got doxxed. That means some troll found my personal information and posted it online, presumably so his fellow trolls could harass me offline like they already do on.\n\nNow, if you\u2019re really, really lucky, maybe you\u2019ll never have to know more about doxxing than that. But the whole episode got me thinking about \u201cdigital hygiene\u201d\u2014what should be posted online, what shouldn\u2019t be, and what sort of regular check-ups one should do to ensure basic privacy and safety. All of which led me to the guy I\u2019m convinced is the digital equivalent of Olivia Pope, Darius M. Fisher.\n\nFisher is the president of Status Labs, which is sort of an Olivia Pope & Associates for the Internet. Fisher and his team make a business of handling online crises and fixing digital reputations\u2014inoculating clients where possible in advance or else repairing damage after the fact. I spent a few hours with Fisher one morning and he walked me through all the possible aspects of digital hygiene. His checklist includes basic things everyone online should be thinking about plus some extra tips for anyone with a slightly higher profile, whether in business or media or some other field.\n\n1. REMOVE YOUR PERSONAL DATA ONLINE\n\nAs far as Fisher\u2019s concerned, whether you\u2019re a public figure or not you don\u2019t want things like your phone number or home address accessible online. In practical terms, what that means is that you have to get your information removed from \u201cdata brokers\u201d like PeopleSmart, Spokeo, Pipl, Intelius, Zoominfo, and Whitepages. Those are the main ones (though there are dozens of others) and each has a specific process whereby you can opt out of their database, which in turn sells your personal information to anyone who pays for it (yes, these companies are making money off your identity). But since their databases repopulate throughout the year, you\u2019ll have to do this frequently. It should be part of your seasonal digital hygiene, performed every quarter.\n\nIn addition if you own a website that can be linked to your name (for instance, sallykohn.com) you want to make sure you register the domain name privately. And incidentally, everyone should own their own domain name or closely related domain names but especially if you\u2019re at risk of imposters (see, e.g., what Michael Bloomberg did here). Either way, you can pay extra to make sure your address and personal information can\u2019t be found on the ICANN WHOIS database. And yes, you have to pay extra. As Fisher jokes, \u201cPrivacy isn\u2019t free.\u201d\n\nMake sure your privacy settings match your needs. And if you wouldn\u2019t want the whole world to see something, don\u2019t post it.\n\n2. CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PRIVACY SETTINGS\n\nFisher is very aggressive about social media privacy; unless you\u2019re a public figure or someone with a business case for making posts public, Fisher argues your Twitter, Facebook and Instagram accounts should all be private. If you\u2019re even on them at all. Personally, I take a different though equally dim view\u2014I assume there is no privacy, whatever the settings say, so I won\u2019t post anything on social media that I\u2019m not 100 percent comfortable with being 100 percent public. Because you never know when a friend is going to take something and repost it for everyone to see, I protect myself by never presuming privacy.\n\nEither way, the key thing is to think about social media\u2019s potential ramifications. If you\u2019re a high net worth individual, don\u2019t tweet details about your family vacation on a lazy island somewhere so that kidnappers can come steal you for ransom. If you have a violent ex who you don\u2019t want to find you, don\u2019t post your run routes on Facebook no matter how private you think your settings are. Use common sense. Make sure your privacy settings match your needs. And if you wouldn\u2019t want the whole world to see something, don\u2019t post it.\n\n3. CHANGE YOUR PASSWORDS FREQUENTLY\n\nAlso at least four times a year, Fisher advises changing your passwords on social media and other key accounts like online banking. And you\u2019ve heard this a million times, but use a very different password for each login and don\u2019t use passwords that can be easily guessed.\n\nHow the hell are you supposed to remember all these new, mutli-number and symbol complex passwords you\u2019re constantly changing? I asked Fisher about the programs out there that supposedly save your passwords, or even generate them for you and save them, under digital lock and key. He pointed out one such company that had just been hacked. \u201cJust write them on a piece of paper and put them in a drawer at home,\u201d Fisher advised. Which, I\u2019m embarrassed to say, I\u2019d never thought of before. I\u2019m always forgetting my passwords and then forgetting how to decipher the cryptic messages I\u2019ve written to myself on my computer to remind me what the passwords are because I can\u2019t actually put the password anywhere on my computer because that would be dumb. A pen and a piece of paper and a drawer. Genius!\n\n4. GOOGLE YOURSELF\n\nOkay, this is where we move from preventative to proactive. In a digital world, it\u2019s important to know what people see when they Google you\u2014whether they\u2019re considering hiring you for a job or checking you out before a first date. So you want to Google yourself, regularly, to see what they see. The key thing is to do so from a logged out browser (Chrome, for instance, has a log-in feature \u2014 so you want to be logged-out) and also not signed into Google or Gmail or anything else that customizes your search. Then you want to clear your browser history. Then do a search and you\u2019ll see what other people see when they search you.\n\nAnother pro tip from Fisher\u2014if you live in one place but are, say, applying for a job somewhere else, you can customize your Google search by location. Under the Google search bar, click \u201cSearch Tools\u201d and you can change the location for anywhere in the world. It didn\u2019t change the results much for me, but if there was a local news story about someone with your name that comes up in Dubuque, Iowa, but not when you search at home in Idaho, you\u2019d wanna know about it.\n\nDon\u2019t like your results? There\u2019s something you can do about it. First, if you don\u2019t own it already, buy your own domain name and create a website\u2014at the very least, a simple placeholder page with a digital version of your resume. Fisher says Google\u2019s search algorithms recognize personal domain name websites and prioritize those in search results. It\u2019s why, for instance, my own website comes up first in searches for my name and Wikipedia comes second.\n\nIn addition, you can try to push up other pages in your search by linking to them on your own website, asking friends to do so, posting links on social media and more. Beyond that, though, this is where a firm like Status Labs can help\u2014offering professional services on search engine optimization to make sure that the links you want are coming up higher in the search and pushing down the others.\n\n5. AND IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG\u2026\n\nBefore you\u2019re in a position for someone to even want to exploit your online photos or personal information, you should do a thorough housecleaning. In fact, even if you\u2019re just applying for a new job in the mailroom it\u2019s good to go back through your recent social media posts and delete any that may be less-than-flattering. Better yet, don\u2019t post them in the first place.\n\nBut if you are hacked or doxxed or such, rule No. 1 is stay calm. \u201cThey want you to panic and overreact,\u201d says Fisher. \u201cThat\u2019s their goal.\u201d So don\u2019t let them win by freaking out and potentially drawing even more attention to their bad acts.\n\nThen make sure you take screenshots of everything and if there are any security threats (death threats, threats of violence, etc.) report them to police and the FBI immediately. If your personal data has been posted on Twitter or Reddit, you can file complaints to have those users suspended. Women Action and the Media has great resources here.\n\nAnd then change every single password in your network. Plus, if your home phone number was made public and you start getting annoying calls or, worse, harassing calls, Fisher says change your number, immediately. There are new troll tactics of using someone\u2019s phone number to inundate them with pizza deliveries or, worse, dispatch SWAT teams.

There were no lines for fried food, little girls with long golden braids walked their honey-colored spotted cows into a waiting pasture.\n\nSomewhere in the distance, a woman sang the national anthem\u2014officially bringing the first weekend of the annual agriculture-fest to a start.\n\nThis calm would soon be shattered by a series of political sideshows with varying degrees of intensity and celebrity\u2014a microcosm of the debate taking place on the national stage where two megastars vie for the spotlight and everyone else watches, hoping for a misstep that could lead to their day in the sun.\n\nThe Iowa State Fair is a rite of passage for those seeking the presidential nomination for their respective parties. Here, they are expected to mingle, sweat it out, eat fried food and stump at the Des Moines Register\u2019s Soapbox (Clinton and Trump declined to participate in this tradition\u2014more on that later) in order to earn Iowan admiration and, later, their votes in the Iowa Caucus.\n\nIt was here Mitt Romney made the \u201ccorporations are people\u201d remark that stuck with him the rest of the 2012 campaign.\n\nToday, it was all about Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump...oh, right, and Iowans.\n\nJust after 11 a.m. just outside a white wooden fence that ringed the cow pasture\u2014the first attraction was about to begin.\n\nClinton, wearing a fair-appropriate blue gingham jacket, entered to the claps of a few supporters who were allowed into the area set aside for her brief press conference.\n\nShe took a picture with a small child, she awwed over a black-and-white cow.\n\nShe strolled to the podium with her latest endorsement, progressive lion Senator Tom Harkin by her side. (subtext: Are you listening, Joe Biden?)\n\nClinton called the endorsement \u201ca special moment here at the fair.\u201d\n\nIndeed.\n\n(Asked about the timing of the endorsement given that in 2008 he did not endorse, and in 2004 he endorsed Howard Dean just days before the Iowa Caucus, Harkin demurred: \u201cMy support for Hillary for president has nothing to do with other people.\u201d)\n\nThen came the questions about her emails:\n\n\u201cI never sent classified material on my email...it\u2019s not anything people talk to me about as I travel around the country,\u201d she said.\n\nThen it was time to meet voters\u2014if they dared.\n\nIn order to meet Clinton, a voter had to get through concentric circles of cameras, the highway patrol, and barrel-chested Secret Service agents dressed in security-casual golf shirts. The large mob was closely followed by a large black SUV that awkwardly drove through the main concourse, ringed by people.\n\n\u201cI saw her hair!\u201d one fan proclaimed.\n\nApril Strumpf, one of the Iowans that managed to speak to Clinton, said she spoke to her about the importance of medical marijuana legalization. Her daughter, Quinn, was on a number of medications to ease her seizures, she explained.\n\nClinton, she said, told her it was important to research the subject but did not commit to support medical cannabis.\n\nEither way, Strumpf indicated, Clinton had her support.\n\nTo others she raved about her granddaughter (\u201ccrazy\u201d about her) and marveled at the famed butter cow (\u201cI love it!\u201d).\n\n\u201cWe can see her before she has her prison stripes on,\u201d heckled a man who identified himself as Denny. \u201cShe\u2019s enjoying her last days of freedom.\u201d\n\nA few feet away from the haze of selfies, handshakes, and barking Secret Service agents, stood an apron-clad Rick Santorum flipping pork chops at the grill.\n\nThe grill is usually a must stop for the normal candidates\u2014i.e. those not named \u201cClinton\u201d or \u201cTrump\u201d this time.\n\n\u201cAll I know is I was the guy flipping burgers. The people of Iowa are looking for someone that relates to them and the problems they face in their lives,\u201d Santorum told The Daily Beast.\n\nAww.\n\nAs Santorum stood frying, and Clinton was shaking hands, a noise made fairgoers look skyward\u2014only to see a navy blue helicopter with the word \u201cTRUMP\u201d buzz by.\n\n\u201cTrump!\u201d several people said in unison as it continued into the distance.\n\nThe main event had finally arrived. Hillary was but a memory of the photo-snapping crowd.\n\nThe man himself arrived in a chariot\u2014OK, it was a golf cart\u2014with a phalanx of security guards, the highway patrol, reporters and a lone, thin kid in a Trump for President shirt who tried in vain to help keep the crowd in line.\n\nIt was like a gilded conch was blown across the vast fairgrounds. On a spot where just minutes before a few people had stood, suddenly hundreds of visitors began to flock. Waving, reaching, screaming his slogan \u201cMake America great!\u201d\n\nThink The Beatles\u2014but oranger and with red polyester hats.\n\n\u201cDonald!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhoo!\u201d\n\n\u201cI see him!\u201d\n\nFollowed by the warning from a state trooper, \u201cYou have to stand to the side. Let's go!\u201d\n\nAnd over and over.\n\nTheir regent rewarded their tenacity by touching their hands, taking selfies and half-mouthed/half-vocal thank yous.\n\nWhen one fan yelled that his crowd was 10 times bigger than Hillary\u2019s, Trump repeated the comment (and will likely do so again and again).\n\nLarger and larger the crowd grew\u2014following Trump\u2019s red hat through the fair\u2014growing as they made their way to the same pork chop hut Hillary Clinton had visited earlier in the day.\n\nOne man, just behind Trump, removed his shirt. And continued to walk, transfixed.\n\nStanding on a bench watching the melee was Gloria Morris of Des Moines.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s scary,\u201d she said when she was asked what she made of the scene. \u201cWhat part of America is he tapping into?\u201d\n\nThe Trumpcopter flew by again\u2014it was giving children rides, of course\u2014cheers of \u201cTrump!\u201d spread through the crowd.\n\nEarlier, upon landing, Trump held a press conference. When asked if he has made any mistakes in the campaign, he retorted, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve made mistakes. I mean every time somebody has said I\u2019ve made a mistake, they do the polls and my numbers go up \u2026 I\u2019m sure I will at some point, but so far you would have to say it hasn\u2019t worked out badly, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cI love Roger Ailes, but all you have to do is ask Roger Ailes, \u2018Who won?\u2019\u201d\n\nAs Trump tore into a pork chop on a stick, across the fair Senator Bernie Sanders took the stage, cheered by a large crowd sporting \u201cFeel the Bern\u201d swag.\n\nLike the grilling of the pork chops\u2014both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump chose to skip the traditional \u201cSoapbox\u201d speech.\n\nMaybe it was to avoid a Romney-esque \u201ccorporations are people\u201d moment\u2014or maybe they just didn\u2019t feel like they had to.\n\nEither way, Sanders stood ready to own the stage.\n\n\u201cEverybody said the campaign was a joke and no one believed that the American people are prepared to take on the economic and political establishment of America,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cIn three and a half months ...we have had huge crowds all over America in Iowa, New Hampshire, California, Oregon, you name it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe American people are saying, \u2018Enough is enough,\u2019\u201d he added.\n\nAs Sanders delivered a speech full of progressive agenda points\u2014$15 minimum wage, paid maternity leave, free college tuition\u2014Laurie Bartz of Mason City cheered every line.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen Hillary speak. To me, there is just a huge difference between the way they present themselves. I think the country is ready for something different,\u201d Bartz said. \u201cI feel like when we\u2019ve seen Hillary speak it\u2019s like, soundbites, it\u2019s little snippets of what people want to hear\u2014trying to make light of some of the issues she\u2019s had in her past, and I don\u2019t find that even funny or interesting anymore.\u201d\n\nAs Sanders neared the end of his speech, the Trumpcopter again flew through the sky.\n\n(\u201cTrump!\u201d murmured the crowd.)\n\n\u201cOh, look, there\u2019s Donald Trump,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI apologize. We left the helicopter at home. I forgot to bring it.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:13.614+0000"}

Of course. But are they also deluded? Are they also insane? Are they under an illusion that they have the qualities to make a good or even adequate president? Do they imagine they possess even one such quality?\n\nClinton, Bush, Walker, Sanders, Rubio, Paul, O\u2019Malley, Christie, Perry, Biden, Santorum, Cruz, Chaffee, Graham, Jindal, Webb, Pataki, Kasich, Gore, Fiorina, Huckabee, Warren, Carson, and Trump.\n\nThat\u2019s not a list of presidential candidates. That\u2019s a list of congressionally appointed members of a bipartisan blue-ribbon commission named to look into a question of pressing national importance such as \u201cpaper or plastic?\u201d\n\nShow me one candidate who has the dignity of Washington, the intellect of Jefferson, the physical bravery of Jackson, the moral stature of Lincoln, the boldness of either Roosevelt, the charm of Kennedy, the effectiveness of Johnson, the eloquence of Reagan, or the gentlemanly nature of George Herbert Walker Bush. (Although Christie does, in terms of physics, have the gravity of Taft.)\n\nEven the nuts among the 2016 candidates do not rise to the level of the nuts of yore.\n\nProgressive Republican Robert M. La Follette, scorned and almost alone, crusaded to keep America out of the senseless bloodbath of WWI.\n\nPresidential nominee William Jennings Bryan thundered to the Democratic National Convention of 1896, \u201cYou shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns, you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina said, \u201cI ran Hewlett-Packard!\u201d (HP\u2019s stock price dropped 41.3 percent during her tenure.)\n\nHas the office of the presidency diminished in stature until it attracts only the midgets of public life?\n\nOr have our politicians shrunk until none of them can pass the carnival test \u201cYou Must Be Taller than the Clown to Ride the White House Tilt-A-Whirl\u201d?\n\nDuring this endless grim, foggy, electoral season with its constant drizzle of wannabes, I intend to make little prose pictures of each candidatural dwarf until we are down to two.\n\nI tremble for my country when I reflect that the two may be \u201cClinton\u201d and \u201cBush.\u201d Members of the electorate in their right minds will go into the ballot booth, see the names, think to themselves, \u201cI did this already.\u201d And leave with the ballot unmarked. Voter turn-out will be 6 percent. The shuttle from the local extended care facility will send a few memory-impaired Republicans to the polls. A DNC bus will collect some derelicts from skid row. And we will have the first President of the United States elected by a franchise limited to sufferers of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and drunken bums.\n\nLet us therefore begin at the bottom of the campaign barrel with the lees, the dross, and the dregs, by which I mean Donald Trump.\n\nOr is Trump just using the garbage of his personality to chum for publicity again? If he isn\u2019t really a candidate, I see no reason to take him at his word, any more than I\u2019d take him at his word about anything else.\n\nBesides, I, personally, support his candidacy. \u201cDemocracy,\u201d said H. L. Mencken, \u201cis the theory that the common people know what they want, and deserve to get it good and hard.\u201d\n\nThe American government is of the people, by the people, for the people. And, these days, America is peopled by 320 million Donald Trumps. Donald Trump is representative of all that we hold dear: money. Or, rather, he is representative of greed for money. We common people may not be able to match Trump\u2019s piggy bank, but we can match his piggishness.\n\nAnd in this era of inflated self-esteem, which has become so fundamental to Americanism that it\u2019s taught in our schools, we can all match Trump\u2019s opinion of his own worth. Trump claims to be worth billions\u2014seven of them as of 2012.\n\nIn 2004 Forbes magazine estimated Trump\u2019s net worth to be $2.6 billion. New York Times reporter Timothy O\u2019Brien looked into the numbers and came up with a net worth figure between $150 and $250 million. Trump sued O\u2019Brien and lost.\n\nMany a candidate for president has fibbed on the subject of his or her economic circumstances\u2014William Henry \u201cborn in a log cabin\u201d Harrison and Hillary \u201cdead broke\u201d Clinton. But Trump will be the first candidate to\u2014like the American legend that he is\u2014tell tall tales about all the money he\u2019s got. Trump is a financial Paul Bunyan, Johnny Appleseed, and Davey Crockett rolled into one, according to Trump.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s critics don\u2019t think this is typical of modern Americans, they haven\u2019t looked at our online dating profiles.\n\nAlso typical of modern Americans is Trump\u2019s bad taste. True, he doesn\u2019t dress the way the rest of us do\u2014like a nine-year-old in twee T-shirt, bulbous shorts, boob shoes, and league-skunked sports team cap. And Trump doesn\u2019t weigh 300 pounds or have multiple piercings or visible ink. He puts his own individual stamp on gaucherie. And we like it. We\u2019re a country that cherishes being individuals as much as we cherish being gauche.\n\nTrump\u2019s suits have a cut and sheen as if they came from the trunk sale of a visiting Bombay tailor staying in a cheap hotel in Trump\u2019s native Queens and taking a nip between fittings. Trump wears neckties in Outer Borough colors. And, Donald, the end of your necktie belongs up around your belt buckle, not between your knees and your nuts. Trump\u2019s haircut makes Kim Jong Un laugh.\n\nAmericans appreciate bad taste or America wouldn\u2019t look the way America does. And the way America looks is due, in no small part, to buildings Trump built.\n\nIn the 1970s he ruined Grand Central Station\u2019s Commodore Hotel, turning it into a Grand Hyatt. Built in 1919, the handsome neo-French Renaissance tower was covered by Trump with cheap glazing\u2014the epitome of seventies smoked glass coffee tables to snort cocaine from, except all its surfaces are vertical.\n\nThen there is the brassy-d\u00e9class\u00e9 Trump Tower with its horrible huge pleated fa\u00e7ade threatening 5th Avenue with a cacophony of accordion music.\n\nAnd Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, bearing the same relation to the noble white mausoleum in Uttar Pradesh as a turd bears to a prize in a Cracker Jack box.\n\nTrump\u2019s grandfather, a German immigrant, changed the family name from Drumpf to Trump. This was wrong. We could have had Drumpf Tower, Drumpf Taj Mahal, Drumpf Plaza Hotel, and President of the United States Donald Drumpf, heading up the Drumpf administration.\n\nBut is that a reason not to vote for Donald? No. We have to consider what kind of president he would make. What would his foreign policy be? What domestic priorities would he favor? How would he handle the economy?\n\nOn all three counts he\u2019ll be\u2014just like he says he is already\u2014a big success.\n\nImagine the strides Trump will make in American foreign policy. He\u2019s crazier than all the other candidates put together. He\u2019s under the illusion that he\u2019s 20 times richer than he is. He thinks childhood vaccination caused the movie Rain Man. He believes Obama was born to the Queen of Sheba in an H. Rider Haggard novel. Putin, Xi Jinping, Ayatollah Khamenei, ISIS, the Taliban, and Hamas will be paralyzed with fear. Who knows what this lunatic will do?\n\nWhat he\u2019ll do is build thousands of Trump casinos, Trump hotels, and Trump resorts in Moscow, Beijing, Tehran, Raqqa, Kandahar, and Gaza. Then all of them will go bankrupt the way Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Plaza Hotel, and Trump Entertainment Resorts did. He\u2019ll destroy the power of our foes leaving Russia trying to palm off Eastern Ukraine on angry bond-holders and China auctioning distressed property in the Spratly Islands.\n\nTrump\u2019s chief domestic policy will be to be on TV. That\u2019s one more reason he\u2019ll get elected. We can relate to Trump. The first and foremost goal of all Americans is to be on TV.\n\nAs President Trump will be able to be on TV all the time, 24/7. Just doing his hair in the makeup room during commercial breaks should keep him too busy to push other birdbrain domestic policies the way some presidents have. And he can yell \u201cYou\u2019re fired!\u201d as much as he wants. It will make for a healthy turnover in cabinet appointees such as Ivanka, Dennis Rodman, Larry King, and Vince McMahon.\n\nAnd Trump understands the economy. He\u2019ll push America\u2019s economic growth forward the same way he pushed his own\u2014with debt and more debt. Average American household debt is more than $225,000. The average American family\u2019s credit card debt is almost $16,000. Trump restructured $3.5 billion in business debt and $900 million in personal debt between 1991 and 1994. We Americans know a leader when we see one. And we love debt. Otherwise America\u2019s national debt wouldn\u2019t have gone from $15 billion in 1930 to $18 trillion today. Tomorrow, with Trump in the Oval Office, the sky\u2019s the limit.\n\nI have a campaign slogan for Donald Trump, or maybe it\u2019s a slogan for the entire 2016 presidential race, or perhaps a slogan for all of America these days. It\u2019s a quotation from the essayist and poet Charles Lamb. Trump will need to Google him. Trump has written at least 18 books, leaving him with little time to read any. But we currently have an overeducated president with a 44.7 percent approval rate. What kind of big success is that?\n\nCharles Lamb said:\n\nIf dirt was Trumps, what hands you would hold!", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:14.052+0000"}

It\u2019s all about loyalty, she says.\n\nAs Donald Trump stood in the lobby of Trump Tower on Thursday afternoon and announced that, after much hesitation and taunting of the American conservative electorate, he solemnly swears to the Republican National Committee that he won\u2019t run as a third-party candidate, his biggest defender prepared to dutifully sing his praises on television.\n\n\u201cWell, I think that the fact that they actually asked him to sign the loyalty pledge just shows the strength of Donald Trump and just the sort of threat that he is,\u201d Katrina Campins remarked on CNN following Trump\u2019s press conference. \u201cWhat I love about Donald Trump is he stands firm in his truth. It\u2019s really the first time in a long time that I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m an American.\u201d\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Campins would make an unlikely political pundit. She is a self-described \u201creal estate mogul\u201d who lives in Miami but lists her location on Twitter and Facebook as \u201cPeace Within.\u201d She is one of the few candidate surrogates who has a topless photo on the Internet. Her ambition, judging by her personal website, is to build a lifestyle brand. But she possesses a unique qualification: She knows Trump, having been a contestant on Season 1 of The Apprentice, the reality show that helped to cement the Republican frontrunner\u2019s mainstream celebrity.\n\nWhile Trump has found myriad defenders on talk radio, where conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Laura Ingraham who echo Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant beliefs rule the conversation, among the Beltway pundit class he has few fans of equal prominence willing to come to his aid.\n\nTo make up for this, he\u2019s enlisted the most Trump-like surrogates imaginable: Reality TV celebrities he created himself.\n\nIn January 2004, The Apprentice premiered on NBC. The premise was simple: New York\u2019s most successful real estate magnate would attempt to find a suitable young person with entrepreneurial spirit to whom he could pass the torch, a one-year contract as the leader of one of his companies, and a $250,000 salary, like a transparent Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.\n\nSitting in the back of a limousine, Trump introduced himself in the show\u2019s first episode. \u201cI\u2019m the largest real estate developer in New York,\u201d he bragged. He got out of his limousine and stepped into a Trump-branded helicopter. \u201cAs the master, I want to pass along my knowledge to somebody else\u2026Who will succeed, and who will fail? Who will be The Apprentice?\u201d\n\nNot Katrina Campins, it turned out.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Katrina Campins,\u201d she told the reality TV-viewing public as she walked dramatically into the lobby of Trump Tower in the same episode, \u201cand I rank in the top 3 percent of Realtors nationwide and I\u2019m 23 years old.\u201d The camera cut to Campins standing next to a wrought-iron gate outside a mansion she presumably sold. By the spring, after insinuating that two fellow contestants were having an affair and complaining about being cast as a \u201csexpot,\u201d Campins was booted from the show.\n\nBut she stayed in touch with Trump after her Apprentice days ended and, in 2014, she joined Trump International Realty.\n\nIn an interview after her CNN appearance on Thursday, Campins told me she didn\u2019t learn much about real estate from America\u2019s future president, but she learned something very valuable: \u201cthe art of branding.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, loyalty is very big to Trump, and it\u2019s very big to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe definitely taught me the importance of branding and marketing,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s a master brander. I mean, perfect example now: He doesn\u2019t have to pay for all his press. It\u2019s just free press. Nobody can compete with that.\u201d\n\nCampins has appeared on CNN \u201cprobably like five or six times\u201d since Trump\u2019s June announcement, she guessed. \u201cI do it, like, once or twice a week depending on the topic.\u201d\n\nShe has defended Trump against charges of racism and misogyny, and attempted to explain away his off-color comments.\n\nAs a Cuban-American woman, she often says, she just thinks Trump\u2019s statements have been \u201cmisconstrued\u201d by the media.\n\nAsked plainly if he is a racist, she told me \u201cno.\u201d Asked if he is hateful, she said the same thing.\n\nAs for Trump\u2019s feelings about women, she complained that the horrible things Trump said about Rosie O\u2019Donnell (that she is a \u201cpig,\u201d for starters) were not the Real Trump, and the media should know the difference between when he is being real and when he is just doing something for entertainment\u2019s sake. \u201cThat was Trump the entertainer speaking,\u201d she explained. He wouldn\u2019t say that now, she said, while running for office.\n\nWhen I noted that Trump had also said horrible things about Fox News journalist Megyn Kelly, not only recently but while a candidate for office, Campins said, \u201cThat\u2019s the media\u201d making something into nothing.\n\nTrump hadn\u2019t really suggested that Kelly might be menstruating when she asked him tough questions at the debate, Campins told me. \u201cI think it was a boxing\u2014uh, he was referring to a term in boxing and everything got turned around.\u201d\n\nCampins is not paid by CNN, she\u2019s quick to point out, and says she actually has a lot to lose by voicing her support for Trump publicly. She also contends that she is not benefiting monetarily from Trump, despite working for Trump International Realty. \u201cI\u2019m an independent contractor,\u201d she replied icily when I brought it up. \u201cI have my own brand. I don\u2019t need anybody else\u2019s brand, you understand?\u201d\n\nOn August 10, Trump tweeted at Campins, \u201cThank you so much for the wonderful statements you made about me on TV. Also, keep up the great work!\u201d She replied, \u201cMy pleasure. I\u2019m just speaking the truth.\u201d She included as punctuation two emoji: a happy blushing face and hands-folded-in-prayer.\n\nCampins says she doesn\u2019t care about generating attention for herself. Still, when I mention that Trump tweeted at her once, she corrects me, saying: \u201cWell, he tweeted twice, and every time I go on air, basically, just appreciation for standing behind what I believe, which is very much in line with what he believes. You know, loyalty is very big to Trump, and it\u2019s very big to me.\u201d\n\nCampins\u2014who has the tagline \u201cCENTERED IN GOD\u201d on her website and posts selfies on Instagram captioned \u201cnamaste\u201d\u2014says she believes talking up Trump\u2019s candidacy and explaining away his comments, like that undocumented Mexican immigrants are \u201crapists,\u201d is noble work. \u201cI\u2019m a voice,\u201d she told me. \u201cIf I can speak for those Americans who don\u2019t have a voice, more power to it. It\u2019s not about me. I wish more people used media that way. That\u2019s what media is to me.

He thrives on and constantly produces conflict, which makes for terrific television. On Thursday alone, for example, he picked fights with Jeb Bush, Rand Paul, and Chris Christie.\n\nIn a political universe where going off-script in any way is seen as potential suicide and giving the press anything to work with that hasn\u2019t been vetted by consultants and pollsters and psychics and who knows who else is a risk, Trump just doesn\u2019t care. He is rewarded for his recklessness with around-the-clock cable news coverage and untold numbers of reporters, like this one, devoting thousands of words to his exploits.\n\n\u201cThere is no malice in Donald Trump\u2019s heart,\u201d Omarosa Manigault, another Apprentice Season 1 star, told me. Manigault was Campins\u2019s roommate on the show and calls her \u201cmy kitty cat.\u201d The pair appeared on CNN together recently to defend Trump.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not a misogynist and he\u2019s not a racist,\u201d Manigault, who is a Democrat and worked in the Bill Clinton White House, said. And he\u2019s not, she argued, responsible for turning the Republican primary into reality TV. \u201cHe didn\u2019t do that. Let\u2019s go back to Howard Dean, let\u2019s go back to Barack Obama,\u201d she laughed.

{"entityId": 1569, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "This man says the New Jersey governor\u2019s pardon of a felony gun charge saved his life, but did Christie really do it to save himself?\n\nOn September 20, 2013, Steffon Josey-Davis committed a felony; and on June 8, 2015, Davis says, Chris Christie \"saved my life.\u201d\n\nDavis is a 24-year-old black man from New Brunswick, New Jersey, and who, in 2013, was working as a truck driver for Loomis Armor, transporting U.S. and foreign currency to banks and ATMs.\n\nDavis, who had dreams of becoming a police officer, legally owned a gun which he traveled with for work.\n\nOn that Friday morning in September, Davis remembers, \"About 5 o'clock-ish, I opened up my closet, grabbed my bulletproof vest and firearm from the safe \u2013 the firearm was already loaded when I made my way to my garage.\" Davis had begun removing the bullets from the firearm, he told me, when he was interrupted by his little sister entering the garage. \"I put the firearm in the glove compartment, put my sister back upstairs.\" That's when, Davis said, he realized he was late for work. He rushed out of the house, forgetting that he had left his firearm in the glove compartment.\n\nAccording to Garden State law, transported firearms must be unloaded and either secured in a trunk or a case. Transporting guns in \u201cpassenger compartments\u201d is explicitly prohibited.\n\nSo when Davis was pulled over for his expired registration later that evening and he realized where his gun was, and he alerted the officer who had stopped him \u2013 \"I was like, 'oh, officer, I have my firearm in the glove compartment'\" \u2013 he was actually admitting to a felony.\n\n\"They took the firearm and gave me a ticket [for the expired registration] and said I could come get it on Monday\u2026They gave me a ticket and let me go.\"\n\nWhen Davis got to the Highland Park Police Department on Monday, he was placed under arrest.\n\n\"I was just like, 'What?' When you hear unlawful possession of a firearm, you're just thinking what you see on the news\" \u2013 armed robbers and violent criminals, not young men on their way to work, hoping to enter law enforcement themselves.\n\nHe was arrested under The Graves Act, which assigns mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes.\n\nAs a result, Davis was facing 10 years in prison. He opted to plead guilty to the second-degree felony and take a deal for one year of probation \u2013 and to begin publicly lobbying for a pardon from Governor Christie.\n\nIt wasn't the safest bet.\n\nChristie has an inconsistent record on guns, but a consistent record on cracking down on crime.\n\nHe began his political career in the mid-1990s, running on the platform that New Jersey had too many weapons. In 1993, while running his first campaign \u2013 for the state senate \u2013 he went as far as to tell The Star-Ledger, \"the issue which has motivated me to get into this race is the recent attempt by certain Republican legislators to repeal New Jersey's ban on assault weapons\u2026We already have too many firearms in our communities.\" In 1995, while running for the state assembly, he told voters that voting for him was a \"vote for safer streets,\" while decrying his opponents' \"dangerous\u2026crazy\u2026radical plan to legalize assault weapons.\"\n\nAs United States Attorney in 2002, his solution for stopping gun violence was to lock up gang members and to \"expedite firearm identification efforts.\"\n\nWhen Christie became governor in 2009, he vowed to \"strictly enforce\" the state's existing gun laws which, he noted, were \"some of the most aggressive in the country.\"\n\nHe focused on illegal weapons in particular, initiating gun buyback programs and encouraging the Attorney General to do more to arrest criminals and seize their weapons. After 20 children were murdered at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut, in 2012, Christie called for \"a large, national discussion,\" one which, he said, needed to include gun control. Democrats in the New Jersey legislature sent 17 gun control bills to Christie's desk, and he signed 10 of them into law.\n\nBut Davis had reason to be hopeful, too.\n\nHis story had received national attention, and his Change.org petition \u2013 \"I am asking you, from the bottom of my heart, to please support me and ask Governor Christie to grant me a pardon so that I can continue to follow my dreams\" \u2013 garnered 75,000 signatures.\n\nFortunately for Davis, Christie wants to win the Republican nomination for president.\n\nPreviously thought of as the candidate to beat in the Republican primaries, which he is expected to enter any day now, months of scandal and political troubles at home have weakened Christie. He has been eclipsed by more establishment candidates like Jeb Bush as well as by right-wingers like Ted Cruz. Hurting politically and eager to repair his reputation among the pro-gun rights groups that have long pilloried him, on April 2, Christie pardoned Shaneen Allen, a different legal gun owner \u2013 from Pennsylvania \u2013 who was arrested in circumstances similar to Davis\u2019s. But despite that move, a few days later, when the National Rifle Association hosted its annual convention in Nashville, Christie was one of just two likely Republican presidential candidates who were not invited.\n\nThen, last week, Christie gifted Davis with a pardon.\n\n\"It's definitely, definitely a life-changer,\" Davis told me. \"Now I can fulfill my dreams and be successful in life and not have this burden over my shoulder.\"\n\nThe pardon is a convenient way for Christie to make a grand display of his opposition to New Jersey's laws without actually doing anything to change them. Michael Patrick Carroll, a state assemblyman \u2013 and one of the \"radical\" lawmakers Christie ran against in 1995 \u2013 asked, \"What's wrong with doing good while doing well? If you can go out there and do justice a the same time as drawing attention to the silly laws, and perhaps while helping a national campaign, what's wrong with that?\"\n\n\"I was just like, 'What?' When you hear unlawful possession of a firearm, you're just thinking what you see on the news,\" Steffon Josey-Davis said recalling his arrest under The Graves Act.\n\nCarroll said, as Christie does, that changing the laws would be impossible with New Jersey's overwhelmingly Democratic legislature.\n\nTo the rest of the country, Carroll said, Christie may not be the 2nd Amendment's greatest advocate, \"If he were running in Alabama, no. He retains some reservations that would lose him votes in Wyoming.\" However, \"By New Jersey standards, he's a rockstar.\"\n\nBut not everyone agrees.\n\nDan Roberts, a 2nd Amendment advocate from Southern Jersey whose 10 year old daughter has gone viral for her competitive shooting skills, told me, \"If I was his campaign manager, I would be smacking him in the head telling him he's not doing nearly enough! The rest of the country isn't buying his phony 2-A credentials.\"\n\n\"He blames it on the Democratic legislature \u2013 that's what I have to work with \u2013 that's nonsense.\"\n\nThe law, Roberts said, Christie \"can change under executive order. He has the authority under the Constitution of New Jersey. His hands aren't tied. He doesn't want to do it.\"\n\nCritics like Roberts might not matter, however. Davis told me he is eager to help Christie out on the campaign trail. \"I don't expect him [to ask] but if I was invited to do so, I would definitely come out and speak on his behalf.\"\n\nDavis even agrees with Christie that he simply can't change the laws. \"There are legislators in there and they're Democrats and they won't pass these gun laws,\" he said. \"I would definitely campaign with him and I would definitely help him bring awareness to what\u2019s going on. He saved me, he gave me rights back.\"\n\n\"I feel as though, he takes into consideration what the new jersey gun laws have done to innocent people and it just shows that he's aware of what\u2019s going on and willing to change that\u2026if he runs ill definitely give him my vote.\"", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:14.356+0000"}

She responded she would think about taking questions from the press, then continued taking questions from audience members for several more minutes.\n\nClinton also responded to a question about her correspondence with longtime friend and aide Sidney Blumenthal during her time at the State Department.\n\n\u201cI have many, many old friends,\u201d she said, a hint of an edge to her voice.\n\nThe New York Times reported on Monday that House Benghazi Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-SC) plans to subpoena Blumenthal because his memos to Clinton at that time on Libya seemed to cross the line between politics, the Clinton Foundation, and State Department business.\n\nAsked whether the correspondence, which she routinely passed on to others at the State Department, according to the Times, was appropriate and if the American people could expect the same involvement of longtime Clinton friends if she becomes president, Clinton laughed.\n\n\u201cI have many, many old friends,\u201d she said, a hint of an edge to her voice. \u201cI always think that it\u2019s important when you get into politics to have friends you had before you were in politics and to understand what\u2019s on their minds.\u201d\n\nOf Blumenthal, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s been a friend of mine for a long time, he sent me unsolicited emails which I passed on in some instances.\u201d\n\nShe then, somewhat oddly, noted it was important to retain the old friends so you don\u2019t get caught in \u201ca bubble\u201d and avoid only talking to \u201ca certain small group of people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just part of the give and take when you are in the public eye,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWhen you are in an official position I think you do have to work to make sure you aren\u2019t caught in a bubble and you only hear from a certain small group of people, and I\u2019m going to keep talking to my old friends, whoever they are.\u201d\n\nBecause avoiding the bubble and having a vast network of close friends are two things closely associated with the Clintons.

{"entityId": 1571, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why would The Donald risk looking like a loser?\n\nMaking political predictions rarely turns out well, but here\u2019s one: Donald Trump will not be a candidate for president in 2016.\n\nWhat? Yes, I know, he\u2019s already announced. In my view, though, he won\u2019t take this all the way to the ballot in Iowa, New Hampshire, or any of the Republican caucus or primary elections.\n\nWhy? Because he\u2019s Donald Trump and everything we know about him tells us he won\u2019t do it.\n\nLet\u2019s step back from the Trump frenzy and consider the realities of a possible Trump run. First is the essential question: Will Donald Trump be the next president of the United States? No. Be it in the throes of a dot-com boom or tulip mania, there are always those who argue, \u201cThis time it\u2019s different.\u201d But it never is. All that we know about politics has not evaporated because Donald Trump says he\u2019d like to be president.\n\nWhat Donald Trump has done so far in 2015 is totally in character with the Trump who\u2019s been in the public eye for decades. He\u2019s a loud voice with strong opinions and loves to be in the middle of the action. But actually putting his name on a ballot would be a strange and quixotic move.\n\nIn the Trump lexicon, the greatest insult is to call someone a \u201closer.\u201d Why would 69-year-old Donald Trump voluntarily transition from business success to political loser? In The Apprentice, Trump decides who is hired and who is, famously, \u201cfired.\u201d He loves that role and it defines his public image. But if he actually takes this quest to a ballot, it will be the voters of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada\u2014all those primary states\u2014who will be interviewing Donald Trump and deciding if he should be hired or fired.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t win, he was fired. He didn\u2019t get the job. Why would he put himself in that position? Short of shaving his head and showing up for a debate dressed in Lululemon yoga pants, it\u2019s difficult to imagine anything more out of character.\n\nWhen Trump argues that his net worth is far greater than the $3 billion calculated by Forbes and others, he is placing billons of dollars of value on the Trump \u201cbrand.\u201d He is obsessed with his image and his brand and that obsession has helped him grow businesses and make a ton of money. Now imagine the likelihood he will risk coming in behind Jeb Bush, a guy who, in Trump\u2019s eyes, might as well be wearing a fake Rolex. Really? How about getting fewer votes than Mike Huckabee? Both of which are likely.\n\nAdults rarely change, and no one changes over 65. Look at Hillary Clinton. She\u2019s the same Hillary Clinton, only more so. And so is Donald Trump. He enjoys doing what he enjoys and God love him for it.\n\nBut what do we know about running for president? It\u2019s the most unpleasant, demeaning, debilitating process in public life, a process that almost always ends in failure. Donald Trump is going to put himself through a year of this meat grinder?\n\nPlease. That\u2019s absurd.\n\nSome might argue that he can rewrite the rules and force the process to change. No. No one has and no one can. The process of electing a president is the same for all candidates. It\u2019s like the NFL. You can come in a high draft pick or a free agent walk-on, but once the selection begins, no favors are granted.\n\nTo date, Donald Trump has benefited from not being taken seriously. The reality is that the majority of negative political stories originate in some form of research conducted by opposition forces: the famous \u201coppo dumps.\u201d No one has bothered to do serious oppo research on Donald Trump, and for good reason. The Democrats hope he will win\u2014God, do they ever\u2014and no Republican candidates have had the interest or bandwidth to do the work.\n\nBut if Trump actually goes on the ballot, that will change. Then we will start to find out basic information that to date has not been part of the discussion.\n\nVoters will learn how often Donald Trump votes, and whether he votes in Republican or Democratic primaries. Does he harbor wealth off shore? What possible legal issues and lawsuits has he been involved in over the course of his career? And that\u2019s just the beginning. Will Trump be able to dismiss questions about his past as relevant to his performance as president? Hard to imagine from a man who questioned the validity of the president\u2019s birth certificate.\n\nSome Republicans seem to fear Trump\u2019s threat to run as an independent. Don\u2019t. He won\u2019t do it. He\u2019s a very smart businessman who knows the threat gives him more leverage. He has built his entire business career on maximizing leverage. Why in the world should he walk away from a powerful bit of leverage without getting anything in return? That\u2019s not the Trump way. But he\u2019s not self-destructive and would have zero desire to go down in political history as a spoiler.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before. In April of 2011, he was leading the Republican field with 26 percent, about the same as he is getting now. He didn\u2019t run but the polls proved he had a following and he wanted to play a prominent role in the process. Remember when, in 2011, he was named the moderator at a Newsmax-sponsored debate to be held two days after Christmas? It was sort of a nutty idea\u2014more debates? Christmas?\u2014but he was confident he could force candidates to the stage. It didn\u2019t happen. Mitt Romney politely but firmly turned down the invite and eventually Trump withdrew as moderator. It fizzled.\n\nA few days before the Nevada primary, he endorsed Romney and, as a prominent businessman in a local community, it probably helped, just as dozens of other like endorsements were positive. Some speculated that he had demanded a speaking slot at the convention in exchange for the endorsement. Nope, never happened, and he didn\u2019t speak at the convention. Like many others, he helped raise money and did what he could to help the campaign. He didn\u2019t get what he wanted but he handled it well.\n\nDonald Trump is having a great time. He\u2019s raising the profile of issues he cares about and contributing to a national discussion. I call that a good thing in a world in which far too many are apathetic and can\u2019t be bothered to contribute.\n\nIt\u2019s not entirely dissimilar to the role a very different sort of candidate named Bernie Sanders is making in the Democratic race. But Bernie has fought many losing public battles and believes there is honor in defeat. Donald Trump believes losing makes you a loser. And he will do anything to avoid that label.\n\nFor most candidates, it might make sense to ask, \u201cHow could he not move forward without losing face?\u201d but the whole point is that Trump isn\u2019t a normal candidate. He went through none of the usual steps of considering a candidacy\u2014talking to donors, conferring with party leaders, etc.\u2014he just got in because, well, he wanted to. And so it will be when he leaves. He\u2019ll exit when polls still show he can win and forever he will be able to argue he could have won. And in doing so, he will have won by Trump rules.\n\nI don\u2019t think Donald Trump speaks for the Republican Party any more than Al Sharpton spoke for the Democratic Party when he ran for president in 2004. Nor do I agree with many of his opinions, and his tone\u2014often, well, it offends me.\n\nBut this is a man who has done many good things. He contributes a ton to charity, pays a fortune in taxes, helps create thousands of jobs. When many were ready to give up on New York City in the bad old days, he stayed, invested, and was rewarded. All of that is admirable and important.\n\nSo my advice to the Republican Party would be not to worry about Donald Trump. This will work out and a year from now, the party will be defined much more by the nominee than these pre-season skirmishes. My bet is that Trump will be trying to help a nominee win and will play a positive role.\n\nOf course I also thought Seattle would run.

{"entityId": 1572, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Kentucky senator gets a lot of attention for his outreach efforts. But he\u2019s not the only Republican looking to win black voters in the post-Obama era.\n\nIf Republicans really care about winning in 2016, then they may want to pay more attention to the voters who haven\u2019t ever voted Republican. With each passing election the Republican electorate has gotten older and whiter, while America is getting younger and browner.\n\nThat presents a problem for what is increasingly becoming the Gray Old Party. The only real choice for Republicans is to win a meaningful share of brown or black voters. But while much has been made about the potential for certain GOP candidates to attract Latino voters, there is far less discussion about whether the party has candidates who have a shot at making inroads with black voters.\n\nOf course, no GOP candidate has to win the black vote. They just have to replicate what President Bush did back in 2004 when he won 16 percent of the black vote in Ohio and 13 percent in Florida, enough to carry him to victory. And there are GOP candidates who have the potential to get much higher numbers than that.\n\nGovernor Mike Huckabee, for instance, stunned the post-Clinton Arkansas political establishment by securing record support among black voters there. Though exit polls indicate he won as much as 48 percent, political analysts believe the final number was likely lower but still significant. Governor Chris Christie won 25 percent of black male voters in his last race for governor and 18 percent of black women, not to mention a high-profile endorsement from Shaquille O\u2019Neal. (Christie\u2019s popularity in the state has fallen off sharply since then, though.)\n\nIn an email, Huckabee communications adviser Hogan Gidley explained that the governor has never bought into the idea that African-American voters could not be convinced to vote for a Republican candidate. \u201cHe was able to garner such a large number of African American votes because he bucked the Democrat and Republican establishment way of thinking,\u201d Gidley wrote. \u201cOften times, Republicans say, \u2018African American voters will never vote for us,\u2019 and Democrats say, \u2018African Americans always vote for us.\u2019 Sadly, the result is that African Americans are taken for granted by officeholders. However, Governor Huckabee refused to believe that and instead actively, aggressively and consistently\u2014not just in election years\u2014pursued the African American vote.\u201d\n\nGidley went on to note that as governor, Huckabee made a record number of appointments of African Americans to various roles. He also pointed to his efforts to move more people off of welfare and into jobs, a distinction from those who simply talk of cutting welfare without proposing solutions for those on it beyond remaining poverty.\n\nIn an email, Dr. Ben Carson, the only African-American Republican presidential candidate, stressed the importance of helping those in struggling minority communities: \u201cI will send a very strong message about extending a hand to lift people out of hopelessness. I know these communities and their pain. My colleagues from either party would do best by addressing this issue seriously. Many of these neighborhoods have never seen a Republican candidate for President. But they will this year.\u201d\n\nBut while addressing poverty is certainly important, it\u2019s criminal justice that is emerging as a defining political issue for black voters. When asked if he hopes to hear Republicans discuss criminal justice on the campaign trail, Republican fundraiser Stephen N. Lackey replied, \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nLackey, who is African-American and in his 30s, explained that it is now no longer optional for Republican candidates not to weigh in on issues like body cameras, but a must if they want to be viable among black voters. \u201cThere can\u2019t just be a conversation. They [candidates] have to have a plan,\u201d he said. It is worth noting that Senator Rand Paul was the first presidential candidate to visit Ferguson, Missouri, in the aftermath of the death of Michael Brown, meeting with civil rights leaders there. He has also penned fiery op-eds denouncing the militarization of police and the War on Drugs.\n\nIn a phone interview, Lackey explained that he has noted a groundswell in recent months, with more and more of his black peers contacting him about possibly changing their party affiliation or at least meeting and donating to Republican candidates: \u201cThere are a lot of black Republicans that have come out of the closet since 2012.\u201d Lackey went on to note that many African Americans\u2014particularly younger ones\u2014felt a sense of pride in seeing the election of President Barack Obama. But they also feel that now that he has safely gotten a second term they can explore their options in a way that they may not have felt was socially acceptable before.\n\nHe said he has received calls from young African Americans asking for strategic advice on how to publicly explain their conservative politics without incurring a backlash. \u201cIn our community for so long you were just not supposed to be a Republican\u2014especially in the age of Obama,\u201d he says. But when he invited young African Americans to some GOP events, including the Visions Luncheon he hosts with the powerhouse law firm Quarles and Brady, as well as the RNC\u2019s Trailblazer Luncheon, \u201cI think they were able to see a lot of black Republicans who weren\u2019t weird and self-hating. They saw a bunch of business people who just understood very basic business principles that would uplift the community.\u201d And black Republicans who were active in the black community and had not become ostracized for their conservative politics.\n\nChelsi Henry is a young, black lawyer in her 20s who became the first registered Republican in her family. Born to a teen mother, she found the GOP\u2019s message and values to resonate with her because they were the values her mother had instilled in her, including economic personal responsibility. She also cares about issues like school choice. Though Henry has not yet picked a candidate, it is worth noting that Senator Ted Cruz surprised many by teaming up with black Democrats to push school choice, calling it \u201cthe civil rights issue of the 21st century.\u201d With polls showing minority parents statistically more likely to support issues like school choice, since their kids are more likely to be faced with failing public schools, school choice is another issue that may give an opening to a GOP candidate to chip away at black voters in key states, and not just Ted Cruz.\n\nVoters like Lackey and Henry represent the greatest path to victory for the GOP. Polling for my book Party Crashing in 2008 found younger black Americans to be significantly less loyal to the two major parties than previous generations. Our polling found that of the African Americans surveyed, \u201c35 percent of respondents ages 18-24 identified themselves as independents, while 41 percent of respondents ages 18-45 identified themselves as \u201cpolitically independent\u201d even though they are registered Democrats.\u201d Lackey, though a Republican fundraiser, has voted for Democrats.\n\nThe bottom line is his vote and a lot of votes of young African Americans are up for grabs.

Whoever is afraid of immigration,\u201d Flores said.\n\nAnchor Babies\u2019 songs don\u2019t carry a particularly political message, though. Flores, a welder by day and a rocker by night, writes songs like \u201cBroken Life\u201d from personal experience:\n\nDo you hear me? You\u2019re wingin\u2019 a broken life? /\n\nCan you feel me? You\u2019re wingin\u2019 a broken life? /\n\nI\u2019m wingin\u2019 on too bitch!\n\nThat song is not going to become the rallying cry of anti-immigration activists any time soon. But for Flores, the name of the group is enough to get a political conversation going. He, unlike his fellow band members, is an avid follower of politics and draws comparisons between this presidential race and previous administrations.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush, I think he\u2019s just like W,\u201d Flores said, referencing former President George W. Bush. \u201cHe\u2019s a follower. [Dick] Cheney is to W. what Trump is to Bush. Jeb Bush basically has no clue, just like W. Cheney is a big bully that George Bush followed and tried to mimic. I think that\u2019s what Jeb is trying to do, but is real afraid.\u201d\n\nHe has already decided to support Hillary Clinton despite liking Bernie Sanders as well. Flores said he fears that too many people conflate socialism with communism for Sanders to actually win. (And for the record, Clinton has already gone on the offensive against Bush\u2019s use of the term.)\n\nEven after clarifying his use of the phrase, Bush can\u2019t seem to evade the ire of those offended.

{"entityId": 1574, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Former NYPD Commissioner, and recent parolee, Bernie Kerik\u2019s memoir makes a bland case for criminal justice reform, and himself.\n\nTen years ago, Bernie Kerik was on top. The longtime NYPD officer had hitched his career to Rudy Giuliani and rode that wave all the way to NYPD Commissioner, then leveraged those contacts into lucrative security consulting contracts after 9/11 and nearly got appointed to a cabinet-level position in the Bush administration.\n\nThen, as fast as he ascended, Kerik came crashing down. He pled guilty in federal court in 2009 to eight charges of criminal conspiracy, tax fraud and lying under oath, and was sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nNow Kerik is once again a free man, more or less, and has reinvented himself as a criminal justice reform advocate. He\u2019s hitting the speaking circuit and doing interviews, talking to anyone who will listen about how his time inside changed his views on the justice system. The latest salvo in his public comeback is his new memoir, From Jailer to Jailed: My Journey From Correction and Police Commissioner to Inmate #8488-054.\n\nThe summary on Amazon describes the book as a \u201chard-hitting, raw and oftentimes politically incorrect memoir.\u201d Given that Kerik used to have a no-bullshit tough-guy mustache, I dug into the book expecting maybe some good police stories, political ratfuckery and prison exploits.\n\nInstead Kerik has done something quite impressive: He has written a dull jailhouse memoir. Readers familiar with the format will immediately recognize the turgid style of the celebrity autobiography, specifically the \u201csetting the record straight\u201d sub-genre. See also: Mayor for Life: The Incredible Story of Marion Barry, Jr. and Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story by Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\nIt is a slog to read\u2014first-person prose filtered through a PR professional and then chopped and rearranged into short, serviceable sentences by an aggressive editor. The end result is sort of like the goop they make chicken nuggets out of.\n\nFor example, here\u2019s a passage where Kerik responds to a fellow inmate who doesn\u2019t like paying taxes:\n\n\u201cBut the bottom line is you gotta pay taxes,\u201d I told him. If you don\u2019t, you come here.\u201d Ironic, coming from a guy serving time for tax fraud. But I believe it. I believe in paying taxes.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Bernie Kerik believes in paying taxes, and he also believes in some loose definition of irony. In fact, he frequently reminds readers that his situation is odd because, you see, he used to be a cop, but then he got thrown in prison.\n\n\u201cHow could I do my time in Cumberland without thinking back to when I ran New York City\u2019s Department of Correction in the 1990s?\u201d Kerik ponders. \u201cThe parallels were obvious and dripping with irony\u2014for me a cold irony. The jailer now jailed. The commissioner now an inmate.\u201d\n\nThe rest of the book is delivered with the same amount of subtlety. As for \u201chard-hitting\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect,\u201d Kerik throws around the word \u201cfuck\u201d a few times, and he complains about the \u201cbullshitting\u201d in Washington, D.C., so it might be a touch edgy for your church book club.\n\nSo the writing is a mess, and no one gets thrown under the bus, but what about the book\u2019s criminal justice reform stance? Nothing Kerik says is wrong or wildly out of line with most other reform advocates, although he does wait until three-quarters of the way through the book to say he doesn\u2019t believe in drug decriminalization. But it is hard to separate the message from the messenger. As Kerik notes: \u201cI understand there is a public perception that I am corrupt. Certainly my convictions feed that perception.\u201d\n\nCertainly. Kerik also served as a police and prison official for 30 years, but it took a stint in a minimum-security prison camp for him to realize that most of the inmates around him were good, honest men\u2014just like him!\u2014who happened to get railroaded by the criminal justice system.\n\nIn fact, the only memorable line in the whole book is delivered by one of Kerik\u2019s fellow inmates: \u201cPrison is like dying with your eyes open.\u201d\n\nIt doesn\u2019t help that Kerik\u2019s Road to Damascus moment was going down for four years on a bunch of white-collar charges. It also doesn\u2019t help that Kerik was housed in the same prison camp as Jack Abramoff, and the two got chummy during their sentences. Incredulous readers will have a hard time stomaching a scene where Kerik is commiserating with Abramoff about the injustice of the justice system\u2014Kerik has just been rejected for a job in the prison chapel and been given kitchen duty instead, not exactly a Cool Hand Luke chain gang\u2014and Abramoff responds like a sage and hardened con: \u201cThey do it because they can.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrison doesn\u2019t need to be like this,\u201d Kerik reflects. It is deep stuff. (Coincidentally, Abramoff also had his come-to-Jesus moment and is now a campaign finance reform advocate.)\n\nTo his credit, Kerik is self-aware enough to realize that his situation, especially his ability to drop millions of dollars on defense attorneys, is atypical. \u201cThe sad thing is if I can\u2019t survive a fight for justice, how can someone less privileged get any sort of justice?\u201d he asks.\n\nThe evidence of just how broken our criminal justice system is surrounds Kerik while he is in prison. He comes across inmates like a mentally ill man with a 3rd grade reading level who signed a plea deal he didn\u2019t understand, or a guy doing 10 years for a trumped up drug conspiracy charge and possession of one gram of cocaine. These are the most affecting moments in Kerik\u2019s memoir. In fact, the only memorable line in the whole book is delivered by one of Kerik\u2019s fellow inmates: \u201cPrison is like dying with your eyes open.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the other inmates are only given a few paragraphs a piece. Kerik never develops any real narrative of his time in prison. The one moment where Kerik\u2019s experience rises above his writing\u2014a disturbing account of his time in solitary confinement\u2014is an outlier. More than half of the rest of the book is padded out with novella-length descriptions of his r\u00e9sum\u00e9. There\u2019s a whole chapter on Kerik\u2019s tenure in charge of Rikers Island and his self-described \u201chistoric turnaround\u201d of the facilities. There are long detours describing his consulting work for the king of Jordan and his time in Iraq. And finally, several chapters on his trial, conviction and sentencing, which he paints as an overzealous, politically motivated prosecution. The charges, Kerik assures, were all bunk.\n\nKerik\u2019s revelations about the criminal justice system\u2014that federal sentencing guidelines are draconian, that they are used by prosecutors to bully defendants into plea deals, that they destroy families and communities, especially communities of color, that the prison system leaves inmates ill-equipped to reenter society and often worse than before they entered the system, that the criminal justice system is used far too often as an alternative to mental health treatment, that the criminal justice system is out of line with our national ideals and founding documents\u2014are nothing new, and he doesn\u2019t add much fresh information or perspective to the debate.\n\nThe criminal justice reform movement is currently experiencing an unprecedented moment of bipartisan support, and as a result everyone is wary of taking unnecessary potshots, allies being a rare and precious commodity, but Kerik\u2019s book is full of cheap platitudes, pat conclusions and bad writing. As a criminal justice reform polemic, it is a retread. As a tell-all prison memoir, it is a snooze. And as a public image fluffer, it is a bit embarrassing and heavy-handed.\n\nThere is also the sneaking feeling, when seeing Kerik hitting the speech circuit, of unseemliness, of the disgraced ex-public official trying to slither back into public life. The New York Post reported earlier this year that Kerik\u2019s lawyer is petitioning a judge to let Kerik off supervised release, complaining that Kerik has been unable to get several lucrative consulting gigs.\n\n\u201cSpecifically, Mr. Kerik has had discussions with local government representatives as well as a national head-hunter for a Fortune 500 company concerning possible consulting opportunities,\u201d his lawyer wrote.\n\nAll of this makes it easy to be uncharitable and prejudiced against Kerik, but he does appear sincere and well-read on the subject. (He namedrops Michelle Alexander\u2019s essential The New Jim Crow and several other criminal justice books.) And if one believes that felons deserve a fair shake after their release, rather than the current system that leaves them unemployable and disenfranchised, then that includes Kerik, too. Even shitheels deserve equal justice under the law.\n\nAnyway, our criminal justice system is supposed to be based on the idea that once you serve your time, you have paid your debt to society. Kerik should be able to vote, hold public office, own a gun, and be able to take whatever Fortune 500 consulting gigs he can get. And he should certainly be able to travel freely and talk to current inmates about prison reform. I hope Kerik takes his reform spiel as far and wide as he can. I hope thousands of dudes in Jeter jerseys buy his book at LaGuardia Airport. And I hope he never picks up a pen again.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:16.451+0000"}

Now it will say there are a few more.\n\nThe United States Central Command is finalizing a report expected to conclude that for the second time since the war against the self-proclaimed Islamic State began, a coalition airstrike has killed civilians, two defense officials told The Daily Beast.\n\nAccording to a CENTCOM document (PDF) acquired by the blog War Is Boring outlining reported civilian casualties through May 1, the March 13 strike in the northern Iraqi city of Hatra, southwest of Mosul, targeted an ISIS checkpoint. Officials first received word of possible civilian casualties when a woman came forward and sought compensation for her car, which she said was damaged by the strike.\n\nThe initial report found that two women and three children might have been hit by the attack. By April 24, CENTCOM official concluded the claims were \u201clikely credible,\u201d according to the document. A defense official told The Daily Beast the final report will likely conclude that far fewer were killed by the strike but could not say how many.\n\nCENTCOM officials said they do not talk about civilian casualties until it completes its report, which could be released by the end of the month.\n\nThe question of civilian casualties has plagued the U.S.-led effort since the campaign against ISIS began. Many are dubious of the coalition\u2019s claim that it has killed two civilians in 6,500 strikes over a 15-month effort.\n\nThe coalition is conducting strikes in communities where the difficulty of differentiating civilian from fighter increases the likelihood civilians will be killed, critics note. And the war in Iraq offered observers a chance to witness firsthand the myriad ways mistakes can happen in combat.\n\nSo far, the U.S. has admitted one incident, the killing of two children in a November 2014 strike in Syria. CENTCOM published its findings in May.\n\n\u201cNobody on Capitol Hill or in the international community is pushing aggressively for an accurate count.\u201d\n\nMoreover, several groups have suggested a far higher number. AirWars, for example, concluded in May that there have been as many as 459 civilians killed in Iraq and Syria, based on its review of local reports. And the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which has observers on the ground, has said it has received reports of two dozens deaths from coalition strikes in the last two months alone.\n\nBut with no coalition forces, few NGOs and other watchdog groups on the ground, no one can independently confirm or refute either the U.S. military or AirWars\u2019 statistic.\n\nAssessing from public documents is just as difficult. The U.S. military has not provided details about where it conducts strikes. Its daily updates can be as far as 50 kilometers off the actual site, making it difficult to confirm independently the outcome of strikes.\n\nOther coalition members offer even fewer details. And even if such strike details were available, much of Syria has become a no-go zone for anyone not backed by the fighting faction controlling a particular area, making it impossible to make on-the-ground independent assessments.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, nobody on Capitol Hill or in the international community is pushing aggressively for an accurate count. And with that, the human toll of what is, in part, supposed to be a humanitarian effort is as opaque as the war fighting itself.\n\nCENTCOM officials have said repeatedly they are diligent about avoiding civilian casualties and investigating claims however they are made\u2014by NGOs, on Twitter, or in press reports.\n\nThe U.S. had investigated 71 allegations of civilian casualties as of August 28, CENTCOM said. Sixty-three percent of those are for strikes in Iraq. Of the 71 cases, 10 remain open\u2014five in Iraq and five in Syria.\n\n\u201cOur method of tracking civilian casualties shows U.S. Central Command\u2019s commitment to taking all allegations seriously,\u201d said a U.S. Central Command spokeswoman. \u201cWe want to be transparent in our process and we review whatever information we have about an allegation, including information provided by a third party. We do our best to be precise in the application of our airstrikes. We take great care, from analysis of available intelligence to selection of the appropriate weapon to meet mission requirements, in order to minimize the risk of collateral damage, especially any potential harm to non-combatant civilians.\u201d\n\nIndeed, War Is Boring\u2019s acquisition of CENTCOM\u2019s investigation of civilian casualties, obtained through the Freedom of Information Act , is the most detailed insight into CENTCOM\u2019s approach that has been publicly available. The document outlines the first 45 claims; there have been 23 more since May 1.\n\nThe document, which spells out when allegations are received, details how many civilians could be involved and when a report is deemed credible or not. The 45 cases total as many as 325 civilian casualties. The most common reason claims are deemed \u201cnot credible\u201d is that coalition strikes do not happen at the same place a civilian death is claimed, suggesting some may be confusing coalition strikes with those by Syrian President Bashar al Assad.\n\nDefenders of the coalition note that no one else in the fight against ISIS is trying to avoid civilian casualties as much as the coalition.\n\n\u201cISIS certainly isn\u2019t,\u201d noted a third defense official.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:16.802+0000"}

In the House, however, Paul has a band of cheerleaders\u2014and they seem to follow him everywhere.\n\nAmash and Massie had spent the duration of Paul\u2019s lengthy speech observing from the benches in the back of the Senate chamber and out in the hallway, promising to block any measure the Senate sent to the House in the event that they were able to get something passed before the PATRIOT Act expired at midnight. Amash said he and Massie\u2014along with members of the Liberty Caucus\u2014had remained in D.C. last week to \u201cguard the House\u201d from any leadership attempts to pass the renewals.\n\n\u201cThere can\u2019t be unanimous consent if one person objects,\u201d Massie told Bloomberg Politics\u2019 David Weigel. Amash countered: \u201cAnd we would object.\u201d\n\nAmash, Republican from Michigan, is just 35 and looks like a young Dan Hedaya.\n\nAmash is known for his vague libertarianism and beloved by liberty-movement types for reading the Constitution ahead of every vote. House Republican leadership has been less impressed\u2014he was kicked off the House Budget Committee in 2012 for voting against their wishes too many times.\n\n(Amash Tweeted on Wednesday to contest this characterization of him: \u201cI\u2019m not vaguely libertarian,\u201d he said. Though, many capital-L libertarians take issue with r-Republicans describing themselves as full-fledged libertarians.)\n\nHis Twitter bio boasts \u201cI defend #liberty,\u201d and there is a Facebook page, \u201cRand Paul Justin Amash 2016,\u201d devoted to the dream that Paul might choose him as his running mate. Its tagline is \u201cRestore the Republic.\u201d It has over 1,600 \u201clikes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe each have an obligation to support and defend the Constitution,\u201d Amash said in the Capitol on Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing our part on the House side and he\u2019s doing his part on the Senate side.\u201d\n\nAmash said he, Massie, and Paul are personal friends, but said \u201cwe don\u2019t interact with each other on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAccording to Massie, however, communication with Paul has been constant as the PATRIOT debate has raged on. \u201cThis past week we spoke frequently,\u201d Massie said on Tuesday while exiting a press conference with Paul. Asked through what means they communicate, Massie said that if they texted, \u201cWell, then they could intercept it\u2014nah, I\u2019m just kidding.\u201d\n\nMassie, 44, who like Paul is from Kentucky, is another vaguely libertarian Republican, though he doesn\u2019t quite have the star-wattage of Amash. The libertarian periodical Reason described Massie as \u201cLibertarian(ish),\u201d and \u201cKentucky\u2019s Next Rand Paul.\u201d In August 2013, a member of Paul\u2019s digital staff, \u201cLibertarian Girl,\u201d spoke out in support of Massie on Facebook: \u201cCongressman Thomas Massie is one of my favorite congressman\u2026Shhh don\u2019t tell anyone but I think he might be a libertarian. [sic].\u201d She added a smiley face.\n\nMassie said that what he, Paul, and Amash are advocating for is what the American people want. Their views, he said, are \u201cvery popular in Kentucky and everywhere I go. They\u2019re only unpopular inside the Beltway. Like, just go to social media. Go look on Facebook, Twitter\u2014you just won\u2019t see any grassroots movement against what Senator Paul is doing.\u201d\n\nMassie isn\u2019t wrong: Last month, Pew Research Center released its latest analysis of Americans\u2019 views on the surveillance state. They found that 54 percent of Americans \u201cdisapprove of the U.S. government\u2019s collection of telephone and Internet data as part of anti-terrorism efforts.\u201d\n\nRepublicans and independents, according to Pew, \u201care more likely to disapprove than approve,\u201d while Democrats remain split.\n\nPaul\u2019s posse is rounded out by Congressman Raul Labrador, Republican from Idaho. Labrador, who looks like a cross between Jimmy Kimmel and Nathan Lane, has a formal role on Paul\u2019s campaign, as the \u201cwestern states\u201d chairman. \u201cHe and I have been friends for a long time,\u201d Labrador told KTVB. He added that he will also be \u201ca little bit of a policy adviser\u201d on the campaign, \u201cworking with him on some of the issues that he\u2019s developing, and just making sure that he has a good opportunity to be represented out here in the West.\u201d\n\nAhead of Paul\u2019s \u201cfilibuster,\u201d his campaign sent out a press release, advertising that there were \u201csurrogates available to comment\u201d on what he was doing.

But unlike a federal bill on the issue, this legislation doesn\u2019t include an exception allowing abortions for victims of rape or incest.\n\nThe governor plans to sign the legislation, Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for Walker\u2019s office, emailed.\n\nNow, on the one hand, 20-week abortion bans aren\u2019t as controversial as some on the left might expect.\n\nA Vox poll conducted by PerryUndem Research/Communication indicated that 39 percent of Americans don\u2019t identify as either pro-choice or pro-life.\n\nAnd when a 2013 Washington Post/ABC News poll asked respondents if they would prefer that abortions be legal for the first 24 weeks of pregnancy or just the first 20 weeks, 56 percent said they would prefer abortions only be legal in the smaller window of time.\n\nBut a 2012 Huffington Post/YouGov poll indicated that 70 percent of Americans favor legal abortions in cases of rape, incest, or a pregnancy that jeopardizes the mother's life.\n\nWhile governor has long touted his pro-life principles, he has also appeared to try to have the issue both ways.\n\n\n\nHe signed legislation defunding Planned Parenthood in the Badger State and requiring that women seeking abortions get ultrasounds first but then ran an ad in his 2014 gubernatorial reelection bid saying he backed legislation that \u201cleaves the final decision to a woman and her doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has an opportunity to authenticate his stated convictions, and I have every belief that he\u2019ll do that.\u201d \u2014 Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List\n\nThe ad caused some of his pro-life backers to have a crisis of faith and left Walker recently assuring them his pro-life credentials were unimpeachable.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill with social conservative leaders earlier this month, the governor sought to ease those concerns, explaining the ad had been taken out of context.\n\nMarjorie Dannenfelser, president of the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List, attended the meeting. Afterward she told The Daily Beast her group was keeping a close watch on the status of Wisconsin\u2019s 20-week ban.\n\n\u201cHe has an opportunity to authenticate his stated convictions, and I have every belief that he\u2019ll do that,\u201d she said, making it clear that all the pro-life talking points in the world wouldn\u2019t make up for failure to move strong legislation on the issue.\n\nWalker is the only leading (presumed) presidential contender who is simultaneously courting national voters and running a state. His party has comfortable majorities in both chambers of the state legislature, which means he has a much easier task in pushing his agenda than blue state Republicans like Chris Christie.\n\nWith social conservatives watching his every move, getting the bill passed isn\u2019t just helpful for his presidential ambitions; it\u2019s essential.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean this is simple.\n\nThe legislation\u2019s lack of exceptions for women seeking abortions could make it tougher for Walker to defend to a more moderate audience.\n\nThe absence of the exemptions differentiates it from the 20-week abortion ban that passed the U.S. House of Representatives on May 13, which makes exceptions for rape and incest.\n\nThat bill has stalled in the Senate.\n\nOpponents of the Wisconsin bill, including Jenni Dye of the liberal group One Wisconsin Now, charge that the language allowing late-term abortions to protect the life of the mother is too narrow.\n\nBut for some pro-life Wisconsinites, the bill doesn\u2019t go far enough. The group Pro-Life Wisconsin issued a statement on May 8 criticizing the legislation for making an exception to save the mother\u2019s life.\n\n\u201c[I]t is utter hypocrisy for proponents of the bill to decry the horror of dismembering a child through a dilation and evacuation abortion and then carve out an exception for babies whose mother\u2019s lives may be endangered, as if those babies somehow don\u2019t feel pain,\u201d said Matt Sande, Pro-\u00adLife Wisconsin\u2019s legislative director, in the statement. \u201cWe urge legislators to refrain from co\u00adsponsoring this bill until the medical emergency exception is fully removed.\u201d\n\nThe state senator leading the charge for the bill, Mary Lazich, immediately fired back.\n\n\u201cMy priority is to protect children from intentional pain inflicted by elective late term abortion,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI hope my colleagues will understand and support this bill rather than get caught up in combative political hyperbole.\u201d\n\nBut even the fact that that debate exists may be a problem.\n\nWhether or not there should be less of an exception for mothers\u2019 lives isn\u2019t the kind of conversation national Republicans likely hope to have as they head into the presidential primaries.\n\n\n\nAnd this all seems to be giving a little heartburn to Robin Vos, the Wisconsin assembly speaker. Earlier this month, he expressed significant concerns about the legislation.\n\n\u201cOf course I am pro-life. I ran for office pro-life. I am proud to support the unborn,\u201d he told reporters, per the Madison-based Cap Times. \u201cWhen I ran for office, I have always taken to allow for exceptions for rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger. This bill has one of those exceptions: it sounds like it has one for when the mother\u2019s life is in danger ... so we\u2019ll have to have a caucus discussion to decide whether or not we want to have possible amendments or if we even want to move the bill at all. We just haven\u2019t talked about it.\u201d\n\nThe bill is moving now, and without the exceptions Vos said he wants. It\u2019s conceivable, but certainly not guaranteed, that Republicans will amend it in committee to include those provisions. And this highlights the extraordinarily unusual situation Walker finds himself in.\n\nOn the one hand, he\u2019s a conservative governor helming a putatively blue state that hasn\u2019t voted for the Republican presidential nominee since 1984.\n\nOn the other hand, the state\u2019s Republican-dominated legislature is arguably even more conservative than he is, and has successfully pushed him further right than he may be comfortable with. Remember that the governor initially expressed skepticism about the timing of a push to pass anti-union Right to Work legislation, only to sign it after conservative lawmakers got it through the legislature.\n\nWalker hasn\u2019t criticized the 20-week abortion legislation, and he\u2019s committed to signing it.\n\nAnd he would face sharp criticism from Democrats regardless of whether or not it makes rape and incest carve-outs.\n\nAnd in the Republican primary, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem at all.\n\nBut still...", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:17.416+0000"}
{"entityId": 1578, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The White House looks to make a big push for infrastructure spending to unite the Democratic Party, fix our bridges and roads, and save Obama\u2019s legacy.\n\nPresident Obama won a major bipartisan victory in the Senate on Tuesday on trade promotion authority, clearing the way for approval in 2016 of the largest trade agreement in world history. But Obama has a problem: He won with the help of only 13 of the Senate\u2019s 44 Democrats. House Democrats are even more annoyed with their president, who has leaned into trade legislation more aggressively than he has other parts of his economic agenda.\n\nThose Democrats badly miscalculated this month. As Democratic Representative Gerald E. Connolly put it, their tactical vote to kill one of the party\u2019s priorities\u2014trade adjustment assistance (TAA), an important progressive program to help laid-off workers get retrained at community colleges\u2014was like the sheriff in Mel Brooks\u2019 Blazing Saddles putting a gun to his head and holding himself hostage.\n\nHaving lost what they mistakenly thought was their leverage, Democrats will now reverse themselves and vote this week for TAA, a program they think doesn\u2019t do nearly enough to protect workers from the harsh winds of global trade but is still better than nothing at all. And to make matters worse, they\u2019ll need the Republican congressional leadership to help them keep it.\n\nThis week\u2019s bill signing will hardly end the trade debate. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal itself won\u2019t be finalized until this fall and submitted for ratification until early next year\u2014just in time for the first presidential primaries. Hillary Clinton will have to keep bobbing and weaving on trade all the way to the 2016 general election.\n\nIn the meantime, Obama needs to figure out how to repair the rift in the Democratic Party and show the country that he can deliver something big for working people who don\u2019t see much for themselves in trade deals. White House officials tell me they are working hard to fund a big infrastructure bill, but they are doing so amid a new oppositional liberal climate.\n\nThe latest trouble began when large numbers of liberal Democrats started acting like the Tea Party Republicans who broke from the leadership of their party to oppose the trade deal. From the anti-establishment base of both parties came an understandable but ultimately irrational cry of defiance, like King Canute raising his arms to stop the global tides from rolling in.\n\nThat bipartisan resistance to reason\u2014whether genuine or political\u2014is problematic in the 21st century. Labor on the left and Tea Party isolationists on the right have made trade deals a scapegoat for the often-harsh consequences of globalization. But the global economy is not a threat; it\u2019s a fact. Our challenge isn\u2019t to stand athwart history yelling \u201cstop\u201d; it\u2019s to nudge it and shape it for the long-term interests of the country as a whole.\n\nWith the highway trust fund and tax reform both on the table, Obama should devote the rest of 2015 on the domestic side to finding the money for infrastructure.\n\nLike Obamacare and any other landmark legislation, TPP has winners and losers, but the winners aren\u2019t just pharmaceutical companies and other big corporations. Sharp reduction or elimination of tariffs and other barriers in Asia will, on balance, help American workers. For instance, removing Vietnam\u2019s 80 percent tariff on U.S. autos will almost certainly mean jobs for Detroit autoworkers over the next decade, and there\u2019s a big boost in TPP for the U.S.\u2019s job-creating heavy-equipment manufacturers (John Deere tractors are popular everywhere but often too expensive to buy with all the tariffs). The U.S. has major competitive advantages in services and IT that will be enhanced by the deal. And all of our new mom-and-pop online businesses will get a chance to export more, creating jobs.\n\nThe Obama administration made a big mistake in not letting the details circulate more widely. Secrecy breeds suspicion. It didn\u2019t help that the news media and social media are largely bored by global trade, which means that vested interests are often the only voices. And the current deal has shortcomings, especially in the enforcement provisions. As Senator Elizabeth Warren points out, the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) process makes it easy for corporations to bring claims against governments, but difficult for unions and environmentalists to do so. This needs to be fixed at the bargaining table over the next couple of months.\n\nBut whatever the deal\u2019s shortcomings, it is clearly advantageous to the U.S. to set the trade rules for 38 percent of the global economy. The alternative is to let China (not a party to the TPP) cut its own preferential deals with its neighbors, which would be terrible for Asian workers, the environment and U.S. strategic interests. Even with the enforcement problems, the deal is a big win for the international environmental and labor standards that, well, environmentalists and labor leaders have been arguing for since the 1970s.\n\nMichael Froman, the U.S. Trade Representative, tells me that on everything from intellectual property to Internet freedom to bans on expropriation, \u201cwe\u2019ve taken U.S. law as our starting point in these negotiations.\u201d Froman, a friend of Obama from their Harvard Law School days, has received a chilly reception from many congressional Democrats who are mindlessly leery of his background at Citibank. They should listen more to his logic, which suggests that it\u2019s not in our interests to set off a competition for which nations can have the fewest environmental and labor regulations and the lowest wages: \u201cWe\u2019re fighting to see a race to the top in the global economy, not a race to the bottom that we can\u2019t win and shouldn\u2019t even try to run.\u201d\n\nOf course the debate is not really about a logical assessment of the advantages and disadvantages of TPP. It\u2019s about the financial and emotional body blows inflicted on organized labor and middle-class Americans in recent decades\u2014blows that Obama understands abstractly but has not countered with sustained legislative efforts. His many speeches about jobs and infrastructure\u2014the same thing, since construction jobs can\u2019t be outsourced\u2014have been necessary but hardly sufficient.\n\nSo far, Obama hasn\u2019t played good poker on his economic agenda. He should have recognized that the Republicans needed a trade deal to show the country they could get something positive done, then linked TPP to a jobs program.\n\nFortunately there\u2019s still time for the president to put his nose to the grindstone on jobs in the same way he has with trade. With the highway trust fund and tax reform both on the table, Obama should devote the rest of 2015 on the domestic side to finding the money for infrastructure. Unlike immigration reform or gun safety, this is achievable with Republicans.\n\nFew Republicans recall that the GOP was founded in the 1850s on what were then known as \u201cinternal improvements\u201d as well as opposition to slavery in the territories. But many seem ready for creative policy-making on the issue. Representative Barbara Comstock and other influential conservatives I\u2019ve spoken with are open to a big transportation bill if a way can be found to pay for it other than an increase in the gas tax.\n\nThe best solution (after a gas tax hike) lies in repatriated earnings. As Democratic Representative Dan Kildee explains: If American companies that have fled overseas were taxed at a low rate (well below the capital gains rate) on their repatriated earnings, the receipts would fund as much as $500 billion in infrastructure investment. Matched by the private sector (quite likely, actually), about $1 trillion would be available over 10 years for rebuilding the roads, bridges, tunnels, airports, rails and sewage systems of the United States\u2014enough (with the spinoff businesses) to offer jobs to millions of the unemployed and propel a whole generation of older displaced construction workers to retirement with some dignity. With interest rates still at historic lows, we have an historic opportunity to lock in huge projects that will quickly pay for themselves.\n\nRepublicans have other ideas for funding the transportation bill and establishing an infrastructure bank. Several have offered a deal involving offshore drilling rights. Or maybe it can be part of a Grand Bargain with Representative Paul Ryan on tax reform.\n\nWhatever the solution, it should be sold not as stimulus\u2014a dead-on-arrival argument with the Republican Congress\u2014but as a matter of strength and competitiveness and national greatness. China spends 10 times as much on infrastructure as the U.S. as a percentage of its GDP. Do we really want China to have a better infrastructure than ours?\n\nOf course \u201cinfrastructure\u201d sounds like a snooze. Many Americans don\u2019t even know what it means. So the domestic agenda of the end of the Obama era is better framed as simply: Rebuild America.\n\nThinking big this way is terribly out of fashion in cynical, polarized Washington. But both parties have an interest in using the bipartisanship of the trade agreement as a model for the huge infrastructure investments that can help rebuild this country. Republican members need to show the public that their congressional majority can keep working positively, as well as bring home long-overdue local projects to their constituents. Democratic members, frustrated by their loss on trade, need a big win for working people and for themselves. So does the president.\n\nIn fact, his legacy depends on it.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:17.696+0000"}

For years now, Uber has successfully fended off such efforts, arguing, \u201cHey, we\u2019re just an app.\u201d We admire the innovative spirit that Uber represents and use the service ourselves often. But who are they trying to kid? Berwick wouldn\u2019t be out there driving on her own. She\u2019s an Uber employee.\n\nAmerica is filled with millions of Berwicks. Middle-class workers face many threats, including declining wages and the rising costs of education. But by far the biggest threat to middle-class workers\u2014and to our economy as a whole\u2014is the changing nature of employment itself.\n\nGone is the era of the lifetime career, having been replaced by a new economy intent on recasting full-time employees into contractors, vendors, and temporary workers. It is an economic transformation that promises new efficiencies and greater flexibility for \u201cemployers\u201d and \u201cemployees\u201d alike, but which threatens to undermine the very foundation upon which middle-class America was built and to strip away benefits.\n\nThat is why it is essential that we imagine and adopt new policies that guarantee all workers the basic level of economic security necessary to sustain and grow the American middle class, and with it, the economy as a whole. We must acknowledge the radically different needs of a new generation of Americans\u2014many of whom already have more employers in a week than their parents had in a lifetime\u2014by adopting a new \u201cShared Security System\u201d designed to fit the flexible employment relationships of the \u201csharing economy.\u201d\n\nTake, for example, an American worker whose story is increasingly typical of this new age. We\u2019ll call her \u201cZoe.\u201d Zoe is a woman in her late 20s who works part time at a hotel outside Denver. She\u2019s worked at the front desk for five years, and her supervisor says he\u2019s happy with her performance\u2014but he never schedules her for more than 29 hours in a single week, so she does not qualify for health insurance or other benefits that full-time workers enjoy. Always in need of extra income, she started auctioning her services as a landscaper on the popular work-outsourcing site TaskRabbit. She earns an additional $100 or so a week at it.\n\nBy far the biggest threat to middle-class workers\u2014and to our economy as a whole\u2014is the changing nature of employment itself.\n\nOn Friday and Saturday nights, she\u2019ll usually pick up a \u201cshift\u201d working as a driver for UberX. Occasionally, on the rare weekday off, she\u2019ll go live on UberX to drive people to and from the airport. During tourist season, Zoe will pick up a little spending money by renting out her apartment on Airbnb, living in her parents\u2019 house for days or weeks at a time.\n\nIf you think all her hard work amounts to a stable lifestyle, you\u2019re wrong. Zoe doesn\u2019t have enough money in the bank to sustain a savings account, let alone to contribute to retirement. She\u2019s never late with her rent, but the idea of owning a house is far out of reach.\n\nThe contrast between the experience of Zoe\u2019s generation and that of her parents is stark. Zoe\u2019s parents entered the workforce with the expectation that hard work would be rewarded with decent pay, improving prospects, and a comfortable retirement; it was an era in which most Americans could reasonably expect to work for only a handful of companies over the course of their career, and certainly no more than one employer at a time. This was the social contract of the 1950s, \u201960s, and \u201970s. But for Zoe\u2019s generation, this contract no longer exists.\n\nThe lesson we can take from Zoe\u2019s experience is that our traditional job-based benefit system no longer makes sense in an economy in which fewer and fewer workers will hold traditional jobs. For while the sharing economy promises many exciting new opportunities, without a new labor-owner framework, it simply cannot provide the economic benefits, stability, and security necessary for a robust and thriving middle class.\n\nAn economy based on micro-employment requires the accrual of micro-benefits, and a twenty-first-century sharing economy requires a twenty-first-century social contract that assures shared economic security and broad prosperity.\n\nWe propose a new Shared Security System that endows every American worker with, first, a \u201cShared Security Account\u201d in which to accrue the basic employment benefits necessary for a thriving middle class, and second, a new set of \u201cShared Security Standards\u201d that complement and reinforce that account.\n\nOne can think of the Shared Security Account as analogous to Social Security, but encompassing all of the employment benefits traditionally provided by a full-time salaried job. Shared Security benefits would be earned and accrued via automatic payroll deductions, regardless of the employment relationship, and, like Social Security, these benefits would be fully prorated, portable, and universal.\n\nProration. The obvious solution to the explosion of part-time work\u2014voluntary or otherwise\u2014is to prorate the accrual of benefits on an hourly or equivalent basis. For example, if Zoe works 30 hours a week at the hotel, she should earn three-quarters of the benefits offered by a full-time 40-hour-a-week job; if she works 20 hours a week, she should earn half the benefits.\n\nTo be clear, proration is not a radical idea. Social Security and Medicare have always been prorated: Zoe\u2019s employer pays half of her 15.3 percent combined Social Security and Medicare tax, regardless of how many hours she works. But all mandatory benefits that normally accrue to full-time employees on a daily basis\u2014sick days, vacation days, health insurance, unemployment insurance, workers\u2019 compensation insurance, retirement matching, Social Security, and Medicare\u2014should also accrue to part-time employees (hourly, salaried, or contract) and sharing-economy providers on a prorated hourly or equivalent basis.\n\nPortability. Job-based benefits no longer make sense in an economy where fewer and fewer workers hold traditional jobs. This is why these accrued benefits must be fully portable, following the worker from job to job, or contract to contract. For example, paid vacation days that Zoe accrues at one employer could be carried over to her next, although the cost of paying for these days would come from funds banked in her Shared Security Account. Because benefits from multiple employers are pooled into the same account, portability and proration work together to provide workers with the full panoply of benefits, even within the flexible micro-employment environment of the sharing economy.\n\nUniversality. In the new economy, a basic set of benefits and labor standards must be universal across all employers and all forms of employment, with few exceptions or exemptions. A robust set of mandatory universal benefits would put all employees and employers alike on an equal footing, while providing the economic security and certainty necessary for the middle class to thrive.\n\nWe need many additional worker-friendly changes, things we collectively call Shared Security Standards: paid leave, an overtime threshold covering the bottom 65 percent of workers, a $15 minimum wage indexed to living standards, pay equity, and fair scheduling, to name a few. Together, the Shared Security Account and the Shared Security Standards\u2014along with family support programs like affordable child care and high-quality universal preschool\u2014would comprise a new social contract designed to fit the flexible employment relationships of the new economy. This is how we will usher in a new era of middle-class economic security, and by so doing also provide American businesses with the economic stability and certainty that they demand.\n\nThis column is adapted from a longer essay in the Summer 2015 issue of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas.

They don\u2019t.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to think of a worse place than Sun City, South Carolina, for Donald Trump to make his first public appearance since unleashing a firestorm of controversy by calling Senator John McCain \u201cnot a war hero\u201d over the weekend.\n\nThe \u201cactive\u201d retirement community of 16,000 is a magnet for military retirees, many of whom served in Vietnam as McCain languished in a Hanoi POW camp and is a a mandatory stop for \u201ccountry-first\u201d Republicans looking to win the state\u2019s crucial First-in-the-South primary.\n\nBut instead of greeting Trump with protests for his comments, the conservative crowd of 600 welcomed the GOP front-runner with three standing ovations, an overflow room of 500, and rapt attention.\n\nTrump spent an hour-plus ranting on everything from South Carolina\u2019s senior senator, Lindsey Graham, (\u201ca total lightweight idiot\"), to the Obama administration (\u201ca bunch of dopes\u201d), and his policy plans for everything from saving Social Security to reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and strengthening the military.\n\nTrump was so annoyed that Graham had called him a \u201cjackass\u201d earlier in the day that he crammed Graham insults throughout his speech, mocking the senior senator\u2019s high-toned Southern drawl and reading Graham\u2019s Capitol Hill phone number aloud to prove Graham had once come \u201cbegging\u201d for a favor. \u201cI think that\u2019s his number\u2014somebody try it!\u201d\n\n(Somebody did.)\n\nNot only did the audience tolerate Trump\u2019s bluster, many said they welcomed it.\n\nMany saw it as proof that Trump is entirely different from the cattle pen of career politicians he\u2019s running against\u2014a billionaire who literally cannot be bought, a truth teller who says what he\u2019s thinking, even when it\u2019s not popular.\n\n\u201cPeople make statements and Trump is Trump. That didn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d said John Doyle, a Vietnam veteran.\n\nAmong veterans in particular, Trump\u2019s drill-sergeant barks, along with promises to \u201cdo everything for the vets, who are being treated terribly,\u201d left the impression that he not only cares about the struggles of veterans, but that he might actually succeed in returning the Veterans Administration, the government, and the country to the greatness they once knew.\n\nIn nearly two-dozen interviews with veterans outside of Bluffton, South Carolina, nearly all praised Trump as \u201cnot-a-politician,\u201d \u201ca breath of fresh air,\u201d and a straight-shooting, successful businessman who, so far, can be trusted. His criticism of John McCain barely seemed to register as anything other than the media blowing a single comment out of proportion.\n\n\u201cPeople make statements and Trump is Trump. That didn\u2019t bother me at all,\u201d said John Doyle, a Vietnam veteran who is also the vice president of the Sun City Republicans, who will remain neutral in the primary. \u201cHe\u2019s used to pushing back at people and maybe not in the best light. But deep down I don\u2019t doubt what he thinks about John McCain.\u201d\n\nWilliam Hertling, 70, served in the Army from 1963 to 1965, considers himself an independent after giving up on both political parties years ago. Hertling said he\u2019s paying attention to Trump this time around.\n\n\u201cI felt what Trump said was maybe a punch below the belt, but I still understood him letting out his feelings about what McCain said about him,\u201d Hertling said. \u201cI do like the fact that he says what\u2019s on his mind rather than the politicians saying what you want to hear and not backing it up.\u201d\n\nMax Clements, who was drafted into the Army in 1957, saw Trump\u2019s bluntness as an attribute, not a detriment, even his comments about John McCain. \u201cEverybody\u2019s trying to take it out of context because he\u2019s leading in the polls,\u201d Clements said. \u201cTrump is not a politician and he tells it like it is. He\u2019s not going to owe anybody anything when he gets into office.\u201d\n\nIf anyone in the audience could have come to protest Trump, who sought five deferments from service in Vietnam, it would have been Patrick McGowan, a war hero by any definition.\n\nMcGowan volunteered for the Army in 1969 as the war raged in Vietnam, serving in country as a \u201ctunnel rat,\u201d crawling through underground tunnels in search of American POWs. It was brutally dangerous work that left him with three gunshot wounds to the chest and a Purple Heart, a Silver Star, and a Bronze Star.\n\nBut McGowan had come to support Trump.\n\n\u201cI truly like how strong-minded he is,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is actually for the veterans. He was not putting the veterans down. Why do they keep harping on it? Trump will change Washington and the V.A. and we need it.\u201d\n\nIf Trump\u2019s rival Republicans were hoping that his McCain outburst would be the beginning of the end of the summer of Trump, their hopes seem to be misplaced. The man who entered and departed Sun City to outstretched hands and cheers of thanks isn\u2019t going anywhere.\n\nAnd if the GOP establishment is looking for somebody to blame for their current predicament\u2014 with 15 experienced Republican leaders trailing a man they\u2019ve written off as a carnival barker\u2014 they can blame themselves. While Republicans and Democrats alike have been obsessing over data, Super PACs, mega-donors, and any other way to game the system for a win in 2016, the outlandish man who built his name into a billion-dollar brand has figured out what brand many voters are looking for, and it\u2019s pretty much anything or anyone with no connection to Washington or the system that created it.\n\nTrump\u2019s key message was easy to lose Tuesday amid his opera of bombast, ego stroking and name calling, but he eventually laid it out for the audience in Sun City and they nodded in agreement as they took it in.\n\n\u201cThere is something happening here,\u201d he told the crowd, making sure they knew he was talking about himself as much as he was talking about them. \u201cWe are tired of being pushed around and led around by stupid people\u2026We need smart leadership, We need great leadership.

Take it from Owen Wilson, who summed up Hollywood\u2019s conundrum in an interview with The Daily Beast last week, saying, \u201cI think part of it is we\u2019re so used to politicians on both sides sounding like actors at press junkets\u2014it\u2019s sort of by rote, and they say all the right things.\u201d\n\nRobert Redford, another usually staunch Hollywood liberal, has spent the last few days walking back comments about Trump\u2019s unpredictability (comments that Trump promptly appropriated as an endorsement). \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s in there because him being the way he is, and saying what he says the way he says it, I think he shakes things up and I think that\u2019s very needed. Because on the other side, it\u2019s so bland, it\u2019s so boring, it\u2019s so empty,\u201d Redford told Larry King on Larry King Now, to Trump\u2019s delight.\n\nBreaking Bad star Bryan Cranston echoed similar sentiments, saying on a Nerdist podcast last month, \u201cThere\u2019s something so refreshing about shaking up that world that is all about being handled, and here comes this loose cannon who has terrible ideas and would be a horrible president, but there\u2019s something great about his \u2018I-don\u2019t-give-a-shit\u2019 attitude that really kind of keeps others honest.\u201d\n\nPeople like Redford or Cranston or Wilson aren\u2019t Trump supporters, but the fact that their comments have been misinterpreted as endorsements is yet another bind that censors artists in the public eye.\n\nThe film industry relies more and more on data as a means of controlling its losses, but even with numbers on its side, it is still funding flops. Hollywood is risk-averse with good reason\u2014making a film costs too much money and the success of a film affects too many people\u2019s livelihoods for the funding process to be treated cavalierly.\n\n\u201cI think he shakes things up and I think that\u2019s very needed. Because on the other side, it\u2019s so bland, it\u2019s so boring, it\u2019s so empty.\u201d\n\nGone are the days of the primadonna or the enfant terrible. Gone are even the red carpet disasters or the off-the-cuff acceptance speeches.\n\nBut the problem with removing the variables is the culture of fear that ensues when those variables are not replaced with results. Will this dress make the movie look bad? Will this comment deter someone from watching the film?\n\nI don\u2019t know, what does the data say?\n\nTrump has been an unstoppable force in the GOP primaries because he\u2019s the kind of guy who will bankrupt his company 11 times over without changing his tune. He is all risk and total chaos. He would be a disaster as president but how he would actually act as president is irrelevant for most people. People aren\u2019t voting for Trump, they\u2019re voting against politics.\n\nThat he comes from the world of reality television is only a bonus\u2014why do you think Americans watch shows like Real Housewives and Keeping Up With The Kardashians and The Apprentice anyway?\n\nPeople are always quick to point out that reality TV isn\u2019t \u201creal,\u201d that it\u2019s scripted and constructed just like everything else. But people don\u2019t tune into reality TV because they think it\u2019s unstructured. We want to watch people say the things we can\u2019t say and do the things we can\u2019t do, because behaving badly in life is just as inconvenient for us as it is for movie stars.\n\nIn that sense, Americans hate politicians because we are politicians in our everyday lives. It\u2019s not the lack of structure that keeps people glued to reality TV, but the lack of filters.\n\nPerhaps due to scarcity, candor has proven a surprisingly valuable resource for Trump\u2019s campaign. But at the end of the day, what is there that a politician can\u2019t say that a movie star can?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:18.297+0000"}

That\u2019s why he's running for president. He\u2019s filled with righteous anger about a lot of things, and lots of people agree with him. Close to a thousand people turned out to see him in New Hampshire; 750 in Iowa, one of the largest crowds for any of the candidates. He\u2019s \u201cbulking up\u201d now in terms of his campaign staff and he\u2019s doing pretty well fundraising, too: With 200,000 contributors at 40 bucks a piece, that's $8 million dollars.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to be outspent, but it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can run the kind of campaign I want.\u201d His kind of campaign is about the big challenges facing the country, income inequality, climate change, the unaffordability of college, a disappearing middle class. He speaks about these issues with an ever present edge of outrage, what he calls \u201cfrom my heart,\u201d that lets you know he\u2019s not just spouting briefing papers, these are his causes.\n\nThe reception he's gotten in the four or five weeks since he announced his candidacy has persuaded him that maybe the country's disgust with politics as usual has created an opening for somebody like him, a 73-year-old self-described \"democratic socialist\" who calls out the excesses of Wall Street and stands up for working families. \"It is not a radical agenda,\" he told reporters at a breakfast organized by The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nHe wants to expand Social Security, move away from Obamacare to Medicare for all, and make tuition free at public universities. He would pay for these expanded benefits with a tax on Wall Street speculative trading, and he would end the loopholes that allow corporations to store their profits tax-free offshore. He doesn't expect support from the Business Roundtable, the Chamber of Commerce, or Wall Street, he says with delight, treating their opposition like a badge of honor.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with running to get your ideas heard, he says, but he insists he's in the race to win, however improbable that is given Hillary Clinton's big lead, and his own marginal status as a national candidate given his age and leftist politics. Asked what Clinton's biggest vulnerability is in a debate setting, he says, \"I like Hillary Clinton, I respect Hillary Clinton, I disagree with Hillary Clinton...We don't have to make these campaigns personal, but we do have to discuss these issues.\"\n\n\"I like Hillary Clinton, I respect Hillary Clinton, I disagree with Hillary Clinton...We don't have to make these campaigns personal, but we do have to discuss these issues.\"\n\nHe wants to know what \"the Secretary\" thinks about the Keystone pipeline. He led the fight against it and believes climate change is a \"planetary crisis.\" Where is she on the trade debate roiling the Congress? Asked if Clinton's vote for the Iraq war should disqualify her from the presidency, he said no, that he didn't intend to bring up that years-ago vote. (Someone else will.)\n\nListening to Sanders is like going back to the future. He is introducing legislation that would guarantee workers 10 days of vacation. These are the kinds of victories that labor unions won decades ago, but that are under assault in a Wall Street-driven economy. Sanders recalled American workers a century ago held up placards that said, \"Give us a 40-hour week.\" Today, he says, millions of Americans don't have that guarantee because they're working two, three, four jobs to get by.\n\nAsked what his first executive order would be as president, he was stumped, admitting he hadn't thought about that yet. He used the question to segue into the impact of big money on everything that goes on in Washington, and the reality that no one person can make the changes that he is advocating for. \"I have a lot of respect and admiration for Barack Obama,\" he said, but the \"biggest mistake\" he made after running \"one of the great campaigns in American history\" was saying to the legions of people who supported him, \"Thank you very much for electing me, I'll take it from here.\"\n\n\"I will not make that mistake,\" Sanders said, making a pitch for a mobilized grassroots movement that every candidate dreams of and that in '08 Obama came closest to achieving. The Obama movement faltered amidst legal issues once he was in the White House, and in '12 became Organizing for America, primarily a vehicle for fundraising and a shadow of what it once was. Sanders sounds like the political science major he was in college, explaining that the free tuition in public universities he seeks will not happen if it comes down to President Sanders negotiating with Republican leader Mitch McConnell. \"It will happen,\u201dhe says, \u201cif a million young people are marching on Washington.\"\n\nThe challenge for the Democratic nominee is to generate the kind of excitement that led to Obama's election and reelection. Among the issues that get Sanders most exercised is the \"massive alienation among the American people\" that leads to low voter turnout. If 60 percent and more of eligible voters don't vote, \"nothing significant will change,\" he says. He is not happy about the Democratic National Committee scheduling only six debates, beginning in the fall, and decreeing if candidates participate in other debates, they will not be allowed in the sanctioned ones. \"It's much too limited,\" he said. \"Debates are a means to get people interested and engaged.\"\n\nIf it were up to him, candidates would debate across party lines. \"Republicans have gotten away with murder because a lot of people don't know what their agenda is,\" he says. \"Christie, Perry, Bush are all in favor of cutting Social Security. I want to expand it. Let's have that debate,\" he says. Sanders has never played party politics. He's the great disrupter.

For close to a quarter-century now, the willingness\u2014make that eagerness\u2014of voices on the Right to embrace every accusation against the Clintons has proven to be a pearl of great price for Bill and Hillary, serving to insulate them politically from allegations that were, in fact, credible. (No, the Clintons did not murder Vince Foster, nor profit from the Whitewater deal. Yes, there was something distinctly non-kosher about how Hillary Clinton made so much money trading cattle futures. No, the Clintons did not hang pornographic toys on a White House Christmas tree; yes, the Marc Rich pardon was indefensible).\n\nThe immediate instinct of Clinton defenders to attack the credentials or motives of accusers is going to be undergoing a heavy stress test with these latest stories, requiring the addition of the New York Times and the Washington Post to the members of the vast right-wing conspiracy. More seriously for the presumptive Democratic nominee, the stories help take the ideological patina off the argument that the Clintons chronically exempt themselves from the rules that are supposed to apply to the rest of the political universe. Throughout their political lives, the Clintons have successfully\u2014and often accurately\u2014argued that the criticism have come from those opposed to their agenda. Now, two news outlets that embody the \u201cMainstream Media\u201d so much scorned on the Right have weighed in with stories that undergird precisely the same argument.\n\nAnd herein lies the opportunity\u2014and the dilemma\u2014for O\u2019Malley or any of the other possible Democratic challengers: what do you do with the argument that the case against Hillary Clinton is a matter not of ideology, but of character?\n\nAs far as I can tell, no intra-party campaign against a prohibitive favorite has ever been waged on such grounds. The more formidable challengers to sitting Presidents have all been made on policy grounds. The Eugene McCarthy-Robert Kennedy campaigns against Lyndon Johnson were based on disagreements over the Vietnam War (RFK clearly believed LBJ was unfit by character to be President, but it was not part of the campaign). Ronald Reagan fought Gerald Ford in 1976 over what he saw as a weak foreign policy, created by (Dr. Kissinger and Mr. Ford\u201d\u2014a rhetorically brilliant evocation of \u201cDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\u201d). Ted Kennedy opposed President Jimmy Carter for presiding over a shaky economy with insufficiently liberal remedies.\n\nThroughout their public lives, Bill and Hillary Clinton have benefitted enormously from the fury of their ideological enemies.\n\nThe same is true when the odds-on favorite was not a White House occupant. Bill Bradley tried to run to Al Gore\u2019s left in 2000, but never raised an issue of character. (When I asked him during a New York City debate whether he thought Gore was honest enough to be President, he said, in effect, that\u2019s a judgment for the voters to make). In 2008, Barack Obama\u2019s case against Hillary Clinton was both generational\u2014I\u2019m free of the arguments of earlier times\u2014and positional\u2014I opposed the Iraq War; she voted for it.\n\n(The closest use of \u201ccharacter\u201d came in 1992, when Jerry Brown raised the question of Hillary Clinton\u2019s legal work in a TV debate with Bill Clinton\u2014permitting Clinton to indignantly declare that Brown should be ashamed of himself for attacking his wife).\n\nUp to now, Clinton\u2019s potential rivals have been taking the traditional route of arguing that she does not truly reflect the Democratic base on issues like income inequality and corporate regulation. Now, they have been handed a much more potent argument: that the financial behavior of the Clintons demonstrates that they identify with the one per cent\u2014or one-tenth of one per cent\u2014and that their conduct will be as big a liability to Hillary Clinton as Mitt Romney\u2019s business career and tax returns were to him in 2012.\n\nBut, as with nitroglycerin, a potent substance can also be highly dangerous. Bill Clinton is the most admired man in America; and among Democrats, his approval rating is stratospheric. Up to now, there has been no significant unhappiness within her party at the prospect of a Hillary Clinton nomination\u2014not to mention the significant cohort of voters eager to see a woman elected President. (Indeed, a recent New York Times poll suggests that Clinton has retained, even increased, her popularity among Democrats) There\u2019s also the pragmatic argument that a frontal assault on the likely democratic nominee will do neither the party nor the advocates of such an assault any good.\n\nMoreover, nothing is more likely to rally Democrats around Clinton than the assaults from across the political divide. Throughout their public lives, Bill and Hillary Clinton have benefitted enormously from the fury of their ideological enemies. Making a case that will persuade Democrats to move away from Clinton on character grounds will be the political equivalent of defusing a ticking bomb.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:19.071+0000"}
{"entityId": 1584, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Florida senator can articulate the best argument for conservatism of anyone since Reagan.\n\nNew York City Pastor Tim Keller has observed that preachers are typically good at either indignation or compassion\u2014but rarely both. The same holds true of politicians. The former inspires today\u2019s GOP base, while the latter has the potential to bring in converts. Only the rare politicians\u2014the Ronald Reagans and Bill Clintons\u2014effectively tap into both temperaments\u2014depending on the circumstances. (But it\u2019s actually counterproductive to use Reagan and Clinton as models. As George Costanza put it: \u201cIt\u2019s like saying to Pavorotti, \u2018Teach me to sing like you.\u2019\u201d)\n\nCandidates like Ted Cruz are good at righteous indignation. There are legitimate reasons why many conservative Americans are demoralized, and he gives voice to their frustration better than anyone. But this is a much better primary strategy than a general election strategy. Echoing the concerns of primary voters is probably easier than challenging them to change, even if change is in order. Meanwhile, Rand Paul accepts the notion that the GOP needs to change, but suggests that libertarianism is the bridge. To me, this feels like a somewhat abstract theory based on convenience more than sound strategy\u2014We need this because that\u2019s what I\u2019m selling.\n\nThe third option is for compassion, which inherently encompasses other attributes like inspiration and optimism. Other candidates, of course, try to tap into this. Jeb Bush\u2019s message probably comes the closest\u2014though he lacks the youthful charisma and American Dream story to embody this narrative. Marco Rubio\u2014more than anyone else\u2014symbolizes this optimistic brand of conservatism.\n\nI\u2019m not na\u00efve; nobody should expect that, by virtue of Rubio\u2019s possible status as the first Hispanic president, he would win the majority of Hispanic votes, or automatically solve the GOP\u2019s demographic challenges over night. Hispanics aren\u2019t monolithic, and Rubio\u2019s Cuban background is less an advantage than some might understand. Change won\u2019t happen overnight, but imagine the impact of a president who can speak fluent Spanish making coherent and eloquent arguments on Spanish language TV over the course of four or eight years.\n\nBut even putting aside the demographic challenges facing the GOP, Barack Obama (and Deval Patrick) were on to something with the line: \u201cDon\u2019t tell me words don\u2019t matter.\u201d One of the primary roles of a president and a politician is to use the force of words to change things. Rhetoric matters. It inspires and teaches. And this is no small thing. A maxim attributed to Margaret Thatcher says this: \u201cFirst you win the argument, then you win the vote.\u201d Republicans have won a lot of votes in the last 30 years, but they haven\u2019t won many arguments since Reagan left the White House. They haven\u2019t taught the American public why conservatism is the best for them.\n\nMarco Rubio stands alone as the candidate best prepared to articulate a conservative message in a way that will inspire and actually teach people who aren\u2019t already conservative that conservatism is the best philosophy to help them achieve the American Dream\u2014that there is, as Arthur Brooks has famously argued, a moral case for capitalism.\n\nAs a cosmopolitan conservative, Rubio also has the potential to appeal to people\u2014urbanites, Millennials, etc.\u2014who might not even know they have deep-seated conservative instincts. These people reflexively reject conservatism because they don\u2019t think of it as a philosophy, but rather as a manifestation of cultural signaling. They can\u2019t imagine belonging to a Southern party that looks and sounds like, say, George W. Bush.\n\nMarco Rubio has the chance to be a once-in-a-generation kind of politician who challenges Americans to think differently about conservatism, and potentially reorders the political universe.\n\nBut why should the guy who manages his own stock portfolio on his iPhone, orders baseball tickets on StubHub, and then hops in an Uber, support a liberal political philosophy that wants to manage his retirement funds for him, and generally supports the kinds of onerous regulations that make it harder for young entrepreneurs to change the world? Rand Paul has gotten a lot of mileage out of his outreach efforts to the tech community, but I would suggest that it is someone more stylistically like Rubio who can sell this message. And he\u2019s already using Uber to make these very points to college students.\n\n\n\nUltimately, Rubio is unparalleled in terms of his ability to eloquently articulate conservative philosophy. And putting aside the obvious fact that any nominee must be qualified to govern (and I think he clearly passes that test) one could certainly argue that there is nothing more important that Republicans should be looking for in a nominee. I\u2019ve been in the room when Rubio speaks\u2014even a cynical scribbler who\u2019s heard a million speeches feels the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He gave the best pro-life speech I\u2019ve ever heard at the Susan B. Anthony dinner a few years back. And just this March in Palm Beach, he talked about how he comes from \u201cextraordinary privilege\u201d in a way that would make people who would never consider themselves social conservatives rethink some of their basic assumptions about the role and responsibility of government.\n\nMarco Rubio has the chance to be a once-in-a-generation kind of politician who challenges Americans to think differently about conservatism, and potentially reorders the political universe.

Why is it, in fact, one of the safest big cities in the United States?\n\nAfter all, almost 40 percent of the Big Apple\u2019s population was not born in the USA. The Mexican community, particularly, has grown tremendously over the last two decades, from a few tens of thousands to more than 300,000, according to census figures, and 500,000 by some unofficial estimates. Yet violent crime statistics, particularly homicides, have declined to record lows.\n\nThe fact is, first-generation immigrants, including Mexican indocumentados, help to make big cities safer.\n\nPeople responsible for maintaining law and order have understood this for years. Rudy Giuliani, New York\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d mayor of the 1990s, used to declare, \u201cIf you come here and work hard and you happen to be in an undocumented status, you\u2019re one of the people we want in this city.\u201d And he set the \u201csafe haven\u201d precedent that people using New York City services\u2014including and especially when they called the police\u2014would not be referred to federal immigration officers.\n\nFormer NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly told me flatly in an email this week that immigration is \u201cthe strength of the city.\u201d\n\nFormer NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly says immigration is \u201cthe strength of the city.\u201d\n\nTrump, whose own fortune has depended so much on Gotham\u2019s, could not help but be aware of this. And that\u2019s why even as he talks about stopping Mexico from supposedly sending its criminals north, and blusters on about building walls along the Rio Grande, he also talks vaguely about opening the way for people without papers to sort out their status.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a very big believer in the merit system,\u201d Trump said on his hyper-publicized visit to the Mexican border last month. \u201cI have to tell you: some of these people have been here, they\u2019ve done a good job. You know, in some cases, sadly, they\u2019ve been living under the shadows.\u2026 If somebody\u2019s been outstanding, we try and work something out.\u201d\n\nRight. When we\u2019re talking about more than 11 million nationwide living under the shadows, trying to \u201cwork something out\u201d for \u201csome of these people\u201d doesn\u2019t really cut it. But at least Trump\u2019s pointing in the right direction, which is more than one can say about the congressional efforts to force local officials to enforce federal immigration laws in so-called \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d\n\nThe popular conception that first-generation immigrants are a major source of crime rather than a major source of security is, ironically, deeply ingrained in our nation-of-immigrants DNA. It was at the heart of the appropriately named \u201cKnow-Nothing\u201d party in the 1800s and it has driven polls over the last 20 years that have shown consistently 60 to 75 percent of the population believes more immigrants cause higher crime rates. As the old joke goes: \u201cMy family has been having trouble with immigrants ever since they came to this country.\u201d\n\nEvery so often, racism and xenophobia gain added traction from gruesome anecdotes. In 2010, for instance, the murder of rancher Robert Krentz in the Arizona desert\u2014still unsolved\u2014was used to push through that state\u2019s controversial SB 1070 law which tried to compel local police to waste their time enforcing federal immigration laws. More recently, hysteria has been fueled by the killing of young Kate Steinle in San Francisco. The alleged murderer is a Mexican scumbag who\u2019d been in and out of American jails for years, been deported, come back, and learned too well how to exploit loopholes in the system, including one judge\u2019s interpretation of San Francisco\u2019s \u201csanctuary\u201d rules, to walk free before this latest crime.\n\nThe high-profile activities of gangs with ties to the savage drug cartels of Mexico or the ferocious maras tearing Central America apart raise legitimate concerns. But the gangs, often made up of young men and women citizens born in the USA and indoctrinated by the American prison system, certainly are no more representative of the larger immigrant communities of today than Meyer Lansky\u2019s mob was representative of Jews, Al Capone\u2019s of Italians or Whitey Bulger\u2019s of Irish-Americans.\n\n\u201cAlmost everyone who has examined the issue and is not an ideologue has come to the same conclusion,\u201d criminologist James Lynch told me in 2007. \u201cIn the United States, immigrants engage in common law crime at rates lower than the native population.\u201d And Lynch, now head of the criminology and criminal justice department at the University of Maryland, says he stands by that statement today.\n\nBut once the melting pot is stirred up with paranoid tales of terror, the actions of a few can always be used to condemn the many, and those who present evidence to the contrary quickly become the target of vitriolic attacks.\n\nRobert J. Sampson, a sociologist at Harvard, has been writing for years about the correlation between large first-generation immigrant populations and lower crime rates, and, as he points out in a new article in American Prospect, he\u2019s found himself the target not only of \u201cthe anger and bile that is typical online, but also assertions that the idea was crazy\u2014\u2018lunacy,\u2019 as one response put it.\u201d\n\nSampson readily concedes that \u201ccorrelation does not prove causation,\u201d but a growing body of data, and the experience of New York City, certainly, shows that lower crime rates can be linked to several benefits brought by first-generation immigrants.\n\nAs I wrote in Securing the City in 2009, \u201cit\u2019s not just that newly arrived immigrants are less likely to be part of an urban nightmare, it\u2019s that they bring their own positive dreams.\u201d Marginal neighborhoods, instead of becoming empty urban wastelands, fill up with new immigrants. They are a self-selected group of people with energy and initiative whose aim\u2014like that of every generation of immigrants since before the creation of the nation\u2014is to build a future for themselves and their families. Fear of deportation may make them particularly careful about breaking the law, but their main goal is to work and to save, and as they build their futures they build the economy and they enhance security\n\nIf there is a downside, it\u2019s this: the second and third generation, as they become more American, often become more troubled and troubling. Their immigrant backgrounds make it harder for them to integrate into U.S. society even as they lose their roots in the lands of their fathers. They may pick up the vices of American society, from obesity to violence, without a chance to share in the virtues. And for a few\u2014whether their parents are Salvadoran, Mexican, Hmong, or Somali\u2014gangs do become a means of asserting their identity.

Rand Paul railed against \u201ca bunch of rich bankers on Wall Street getting bonuses on the backs of the middle class.\u201d Marco Rubio proposed a child tax credit (gasp!) paid for with a higher tax on upper-income earners, the rough equivalent of inviting Occupy Wall Street to use the showers at the Reagan Library.\n\nWorse, a group of young policy wonks known as the \u201cReformicons\u201d were gaining traction in elite party circles, championing a message that the party should move away from\u2014as The New York Times put it\u2014\u201corgiastic tax-cutting, the slashing of government programs, the championing of Wall Street.\u201d\n\n\n\nOver dinner at a restaurant on the Upper East Side, Larry Kudlow, the CNBC host and former Reagan administration economist, fretted over how to respond, along with his wife, Judith, Club for Growth founder Stephen Moore, and Alexandra Preate, a PR maven who has been described as \u201cThe Peggy Siegal of Republican politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany of them have not dealt with these kind of issues before. We are, quite frankly, tryingto educate them.\u201d\n\nFor an answer, they looked back to a time when Western civilization was in danger of being obliterated, and a group of Cold War hawks formed the Committee on Present Danger to ring the alarm on the Soviet threat. They would call themselves \u201cThe Committee to Unleash American Prosperity\u201d and would attempt to educate GOP presidential candidates on the benefits of supply-side economics and stiffen their backbones.\n\nThe group took their idea to John Catsimatidis, the New York supermarket magnate\u2014and suitor of the New York Daily News\u2014who has single-handedly covered all of the expenses for \u201cThe Committee to Unleash American Prosperity\u201d so far. This has included nearly a half-dozen sit-down dinners for upwards of 60 people\u2014including some of the top contenders for the GOP crown\u2014at some of the most expensive restaurants in New York, like the Four Seasons and the 21 Club.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, we are all concerned that our kids are not going to have as good a life as we did. We have had a good 30 to 40 years. We have liked the last 30 to 40 years, and we are concerned about the next 30 to 40 years,\u201d Catsimatidis told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have made enough money. You did and I did and the friends we are sitting with did. If our kids need an apartment, we pay for the kid\u2019s apartment. Do you think your kids will be able to do that for their kids?\u201d\n\nThe Committee\u2019s core group\u2014\u201ca bunch of old Reagan guys,\u201d as Kudlow put it, which grew to include Steve Forbes and supply-side patriarch Art Laffer\u2014believe that since World War II, the American economy has grown by 3\u00bd percent annually, but that over the last 15 years, growth has shrunk to 2 percent annually.\n\n\u201cThis growth slump has damaged investment, employment, incomes, poverty, social mobility, family life, and above all, lack of growth has damaged the American dream of opportunity for all,\u201d says a Committee memo that serves as something of a founding document. \u201cThe great American idea that you can come from humble background and rise to the top has been undermined\u2026As President Ronald Reagan taught us \u2018weakness at home leads to weakness abroad.\u2019 Unfortunately, American international leadership and influence has suffered in recent years proving the President Reagan\u2019s analysis was completely correct.\u201d\n\nThe Committee has come up with key principles that would make Uncle Ronnie proud. Among them: \u201ca flat tax; limited government spending; lite regulation; sound money; free trade; and the rule of Constitutional law.\u201d\n\nA strict flat tax aside, this sounds pretty much like the economic platform of every single Republican contender\u2014a point Kudlow concedes.\n\n\u201cYes, [their] rhetoric is not bad. There is a lack of detail and specifics however,\u201d he told The Daily Beast in a phone interview, after a luncheon honoring David Koch\u2019s charitable work. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a bunch of smart guys and most of them want to remain in the Reagan tradition of supply-side economics and tax cuts and deregulation. We get that.\u201d\n\nClub for Growth founder Moore said that the point of the Committee to Unleash American Prosperity was not so much to remind the GOP contenders of core principles as it was to explain the basics to them.\n\n\u201cMany of them have not dealt with these kind of issues before. We are, quite frankly, trying to educate them,\u201d he said.\n\nEconomic growth, Moore added, was actually being underplayed on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama gave a major speech the other day, and he said that the greatest problem facing the planet is climate change. I am sorry, but if he really believes that he is not putting growth first. No, the biggest problem facing the country right now is not climate change\u2014it is putting every American into a job and making sure they have higher wages.\u201d\n\nEven most Republicans, Moore added, were growing too \u201cspooked\u201d to push for more tax cuts for the rich.\n\n\u201cThe liberals are talking about redistribution. I don\u2019t think that the greed and envy agenda is as popular with voters as some of Reformicon friends seem to think it is.\u201d\n\nMoore said that many Republicans think ideas like \u201cthe flat tax are non-starters. It\u2019s a good thing they weren\u2019t around in the 1980s or Ronald Reagan would never have done his tax cuts. If you put the Rand Paul flat-tax proposal next to the Marco Rubio Reformicon proposal, 80, 90 percent of Republicans would be with Paul.\u201d\n\nThe Committee also thinks Republicans need to stop blaming Wall Street and finance for the economic collapse of 2008. \u201cWe know what Hillary Clinton is going to say,\u201d Moore said. \u201cShe is going to echo Elizabeth Warren and say these companies and banks didn\u2019t want any regulation and they drove the economy off the cliff. Republicans have to say that that isn\u2019t what happened at all. That Chris Dodd and Barney Frank and the government tried to subsidize all of these mortgages that people couldn\u2019t afford and it led to the biggest housing bust in the history of this country, and this was done by the government, not the private sector. It wasn\u2019t the market that failed. It was the government.\u201d\n\nWhen presented with the Committee\u2019s tenants, Ramesh Ponnuru, a senior editor at the National Review and an uber-Reformicon, countered that tax cuts for the sake of tax cuts have led to diminishing returns. If the American economy was spurred when the highest rates went from 70 percent to 40 percent, further reductions were naturally going to have less of an effect.\n\nReagan would agree with him, Ponnuru said. He noted that Ronnie\u2019s tax cuts were centered on middle-class tax relief, and not specifically aimed at growth. Ponnuru also mentioned that George W. Bush not only reduced taxes but that he extended the child tax credit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that the Republican Party needs much convincing that lower tax rates are better and that growth is good. I think they need some help in finding ways to advance those goals while also offering tax relief to middle-class families,\u201d Ponnuru said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kudlow and Moore are pressing ahead. They say that every Republican running for president has agreed to appear before their group. Invitations are being extended to Hillary Clinton and the Democrats, but they don\u2019t expect a response. Each candidate submits to a private, hour-long session with Kudlow, Moore, Laffer and Forbes, before giving a brief talk to the assembled Committee members and answering questions. The audience is invited exclusively by the organizers, and the guest list is made up mostly of opinion leaders in the conservative world\u2014hosts and correspondents from Fox News and Fox Business, editorialists with the Wall Street Journal and New York Post, think-tankers from Cato and Heritage and the Manhattan Institute.\n\nDespite their star-studded guest list, though, the meetings have been gaining a reputation for going off the rails. It was at a Committee meeting that Rudy Giuliani showed up and announced that Barack Obama didn\u2019t love America. At another Committee meeting, Rick Perry was scheduled as a speaker and fellow 2016 rival George Pataki showed up in the audience. At yet another one, Ohio Governor John Kasich was backed into a corner by a Manhattan Institute scholar who wanted to know why Kasich had expanded Medicaid in his state.\n\nFor now, The Committee to Unleash American Prosperity is sticking to swank dining spots in New York, but they have plans to take the show on the road, traveling to key primary and swing states to educate the public on what it takes to spur growth.\n\nA website, a social media campaign, and policy papers are also in the works.\n\n\u201cAll we want,\u201d said Kudlow, \u201cis for everybody to get richer.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:20.046+0000"}

Listen to what Trump just said about John McCain,\u201d Kerry was saying over the phone. \u201c\u2018He\u2019s not a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u2019\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s unbelievable,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cThat\u2019s beyond outrageous.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cJohn and I have some serious differences on a lot of things but he is nothing other than a hero and a good man. Where was Trump when John got shot down over North Vietnam? In school? At a party? Where was he?\u201d\n\nFor many months now, years even, Kerry has been point man in Barack Obama\u2019s attempt to restrict Iran\u2019s plan to develop a nuclear bomb. He has been a walking high-wire act, traveling a region that is nothing less than a geographical bonfire filled with the debris of failed nations, countries that have collapsed into chaos and terror largely because of the contrived plans of men like Dick Cheney who dreamed of the day when Saddam Hussein could be toppled. The conservative ideologues got their wish while the United States got a larger, longer war and the Middle East became an even bigger source of horror and death.\n\nTrump\u2019s assault on McCain evoked immediate anger in Kerry because it resurrected feelings within him that are always there, certainly beneath a surface calm but always, always there: a long gone war called Vietnam.\n\n\u201cAll of us sat for weeks and months around a table trying to get this deal done,\u201d Kerry was saying. \u201cThe Russians, the Chinese, the French, the British, the Germans, all of us. And every once in awhile I thought about that other table, that other time, and that was nearly a half century ago.\u201d\n\nHe was talking about the Paris Peace Talks that began in 1970 and concluded with an agreement signed on January 23, 1973. Henry Kissinger represented another president, Richard Nixon. John McCain was in Hanoi, in captivity. John Kerry had returned from Vietnam to help organize Vietnam Veterans Against The War. Donald Trump was somewhere else.\n\n\u201cWhere was Trump when John got shot down over North Vietnam? In school? At a party? Where was he?\u201d\n\n\n\nAs talks in Paris dragged on, more than half of the 58,195 names carved into the wall of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington were killed. Thousands more were wounded and carry those wounds still, today.\n\nBoth Kerry and Obama are firm believers that conversation is a better starter-kit than combat when it comes to dealing with a country like Iran. Neither man is naive about that nation\u2019s aspiration to dominate the region.\n\n\u201cBut the Iranians are not suicidal,\u201d Kerry pointed out.\n\nClearly, the Iranians are well aware that Teheran would be turned into a field of glass and sand if they ever stepped toward open war with Israel or Saudi Arabia. And every nation around that table in Vienna knew that the sanctions that crippled the Iranian economy and caused Iran to accept a deal would soon collapse under the weight of countries like France, Russia and China that were eager to begin doing business in Teheran, the dollar emerging as the strongest weapon of all.\n\nSo as he shuttled back and forth between Washington and Vienna, his leg broken, his spirit determined, Kerry found himself thinking about that other time and those other talks. He is a student of history and in his mind\u2019s eye he saw another president, Lyndon Johnson, broken by a long war that still lingers in the American psyche. He thought about the Ivy League sophisticates that surrounded John F. Kennedy and then Johnson, men named Bundy, Rostow, McNamara, and others who spent the lives of so many younger men pursuing their old men\u2019s dreams of defeating communism in the lethal laboratory of Vietnam.\n\nIn a trick of history and irony communism collapsed on a deathbed that Ronald Reagan helped make up by\u2026talking; talking to Mikhail Gorbachev. A wall fell. One continent, Europe, changed forever. Two nations, Russia and the United States, altered their behavior toward each another because of a handshake and a conversation.\n\nLast week, John Kerry returned to the United States. After months of discussion, Germany, China, France, the United Kingdom, and Putin\u2019s Russia along with the U.S. had a deal with Iran. Now it goes to a Congress more than half full of politicians who place a higher priority in defeating anything Barack Obama supports than educating the country and the world with an honest debate about a deal structured to insert more than a decade\u2019s worth of roadblocks in Iran\u2019s drive to develop a nuclear weapon.\n\nAnd as John Kerry came home, his mind filled with facts, the ups, the downs, the potential, and the politics of getting an accord with Iran through the Congress, he was brought back to his own war five decades ago. A war that won\u2019t go away. A war that awoke him one more time because of a libelous slur uttered by a real estate man against a friend of Kerry\u2019s who will line up against him on the treaty with Iran.

PunditFact checks it out.\n\nDid foreign interests curry favor with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by paying huge speaking fees to her husband?\n\nThat\u2019s the question raised in the forthcoming book Clinton Cash by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend.\n\n\u201cWhen you ever have an issue of the flow of funds to political candidates, whether that's to their campaigns, whether that's to private foundations, whether that's to their spouse, is there evidence of a pattern of \u2014 of favorable decisions being made for those individuals?\u201d Schweizer said on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cAnd I think the \u2014 the point that we make in the book is that there is a troubling pattern.\u201d\n\nSchweizer pointed to a few examples, including the sale of a uranium company backed by Clinton financial supporters to a Russian company. The sale required approval of a U.S. government board that includes representatives from nine agencies, including the Department of State.\n\nAnother piece of circumstantial evidence offered by Schweizer: Of the 13 times Bill Clinton received $500,000 or more in speaking fees, 11 came while his wife was secretary of state.\n\nPunditFact can\u2019t fact-check Schweizer\u2019s \u201ctroubling pattern,\u201d but we did want to look at the specific claim about Bill Clinton\u2019s speaking fees. That rates True .\n\nIn 2014, the Washington Post analyzed Clinton\u2019s speaking fees and found the former president made at least $104 million between 2001 through 2012. More than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries.\n\nTo find out more, we turned to Hillary Clinton\u2019s federal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, financial information for both Clintons is available for all those years.\n\nIncome information on the financial disclosure forms supports Schweizer\u2019s claim. We indeed found 13 speeches between 2001 and 2012 in which Bill Clinton was paid $500,000 or more. All but two occurred after January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. You can see the full list at PunditFact.com .\n\nNewt Gingrich went even further than Schweizer on Sunday, saying foreign donations accepted by the Clinton Foundation were \u201cclearly illegal.\u201d\n\n\"The Constitution says you can't take this stuff,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cWe have federal laws that say you can't take this stuff. If this was any person but Hillary Clinton, they'd be under indictment right now for a clearly straightforward problem.\u201d\n\nGingrich is referencing a part of the Constitution known as the Emoluments Clause. But he\u2019s going too far by claiming that the Clinton Foundation donations are \u201cclearly illegal.\u201d PunditFact rates that claim Mostly False .\n\nThe Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part:\n\n\"No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\n\nThe framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence.\n\nWe asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were \u201cclearly illegal\u201d and a violation of the Emoluments Clause.\n\nWe did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich.\n\nThe American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, \u201ceven if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,\u201d said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced.\n\n\u201cI very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee\u2019s relative,\u201d he said. \u201cGingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they\u2019re formally \u2014 and, thus, legally \u2014 distinct.\u201d\n\nRobert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich\u2019s link between Clinton and the foreign governments\u2019 gifts to the Clinton Foundation as \u201cimplausible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood,\u201d Delahunty said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:20.540+0000"}

He filed to run for the President of the United States with the FEC on July 26 as Deez Nuts.\n\nAccording to a Public Policy Polling survey released Wednesday, almost one in 10 Tar Heel State voters would vote for him in a race between Nuts, Donald Trump, and Hillary Clinton.\n\n(Limberbutt McCubbins, by the way, is a cat from Kentucky seeking the Democratic nomination for president.)\n\nDozens of real Deez Nutses or Deez Nutzes do live as citizens in the United States of America with legally changed names, from Phoenix, Arizona, to West Hartford, Connecticut, from sea to shining sea, but a potential president does not appear to be one of them.\n\nAccording to a Federal Election Commission filing, the Deez Nuts running for president lives at 2248 450th Avenue in Wallingford, Iowa. The problem, however, is that there is no Deez Nuts who lives in Wallingford, Iowa\u2014a tiny town of 197 people\u2014according to the Emmet County recorder\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cSeriously?\u201d Emmet County recorder\u2019s assistant Jill White asked when The Daily Beast mentioned there was a federally registered presidential candidate by the name of \u201cDeez Nuts\u201d\u2014and that a reporter was requesting information on a resident by that name.\n\nThere\u2019s only Brady Olson, the son of a farmer and a dental assistant, and a rising sophomore at the Graettinger Terril Ruthven Ayrshire Community School in rural Iowa.\n\nNow he\u2019s trying to figure out his path to becoming the first 15-year-old President of the United States under an assumed name.\n\n\u201cThe next step is to get some party nominations, like the Minnesota Independence Party or the Modern Whig Party,\u201d Olson says. \u201cIt would also be great to find a VP, preferably McCubbins because the Nuts/McCubbins ticket sounds amazing.\u201d\n\nSo how did Brady Olson go from standard Iowa high school student to the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter\u2014literally overnight?\n\n\u201cThe polls are pretty long. By the time we drop Deez Nuts on them, they\u2019re pretty deep into the poll.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt started because somebody emailed us under the name Deez Nuts,\u201d says Jim Williams, an issue polling specialist a Public Policy Polling. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m Deez Nuts. I\u2019m running. Here\u2019s my filing statement. Would you poll me?\u2019\u201d\n\nWilliams thought \u201cthis is something Public Policy Polling would do,\u201d so he squared Nuts off against Trump and Clinton in Minnesota a few weeks ago. He polled at 7 percent.\n\n\u201cI thought, \u2018Let\u2019s put this out. This\u2019ll be funny,\u2019\u201d he says, and it was met with \u201cmild interest.\u201d\n\nBut when his numbers rose after two more polls\u20148 percent in Iowa, then 9 percent in North Carolina\u2014Nuts took off. On Wednesday, Deez Nuts was trending worldwide on Twitter.\n\n\u201cToday, we\u2019ve clearly reached the tipping point,\u201d says Williams.\n\nThere is no 9-1-1 listing corresponding to that 2248 450th Street, according to officials at the Emmet County Registry of Deeds. Next door\u2014at 2250 450th Street in Wallingford\u2014sits Olson Land & Livestock, which is owned by Brady\u2019s dad, Mark Olson.\n\n\u201cAnybody can fill out a Form 2,\u201d says FEC Deputy Press Officer Christian Hilland. \u201cWe do vetting, but it\u2019s more about did they fill out the information correctly? Did they review the fields? It doesn\u2019t speak to the authenticity of the individual who filed the claim.\u201d\n\n\u201cNuts\u201d did, in fact, fill out a Form 2\u2014a statement of candidacy\u2014on July 26. The form had no information other than the Wallingford address and his Independent party affiliation.\n\nFellow Form 2 filers for the 2016 election cycle include Sydneys Vuluptuous Buttocks, Kenny Rodeo, Eden, and Ole\u2019 Savior. Savior, a Republican, ran and lost in four other elections since 2006.\n\nSavior and Nuts join President Emperor Caesar, Buddy the Cat, Buddy the Elf, Jack Sparrow, James \u201cTitus the Great\u201d Law, Princess Oawlawolwaol, and Donald Trump in the 2016 race for the presidency.\n\nYou can fill out your own Form 2 here and\u2014good news\u2014none of the fields are immediately checked against public records searches.\n\nYou, too, can be Deez Nuts from Wallingford, Iowa. The problems will only start to appear when your grassroots campaign for the presidency starts to receive the support of almost one-tenth of the residents of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cWe check for things like, \u2018What election cycle are you running in?\u2019 If one or more of those fields are missing, we have campaign finance analysts who review those reports,\u201d says Hilland. \u201cWe send a letter to the listed address that asks for clarification or an amendment.\u201d\n\nAlso, if he or she raises $5,000, whoever lives at 2248 450th Avenue is going to have to come up with a real name. Nuts will then have to file a Form 1, which requires a name, phone number and address that check out.\n\nAnd, again, the name doesn\u2019t check out.\n\n\u201cThe name isn\u2019t familiar to me.

Summer interns volunteer 30 to 40 hours a week, while interns who work during a college semester may work 25 hours. The most some interns receive is a $2,000 stipend for a four-month period, and that depends on financial need.\n\nPaying them all New York\u2019s minimum wage of $8.75, for instance, would cost a fraction of the foundation\u2019s budget, which spent $29.9 million (PDF) on employee salaries, compensation, and benefits for about 2,000 employees worldwide in 2013.\n\n\u201cThere is no section of the Labor Law that exempts \u2018interns\u2019 at not-for-profit organizations from the minimum wage requirements,\u201d a New York Department of Labor handout clarifies (PDF). Unlike for-profit corporations, nonprofits in New York are allowed to employ unpaid volunteers. Unpaid volunteers can\u2019t be required to work certain hours though (Foundation interns are), and they cannot be compensated in any way except for reimbursement for expenses (some Foundation interns get stipends).\n\nPaying them all New York\u2019s minimum wage of $8.75, for instance, would cost a fraction of the foundation\u2019s budget.\n\nFormer interns say they don\u2019t mind no dough, though.\n\nMaggie Leahy interned in the Foundation\u2019s communications department in summer 2010, a semester before she graduated from New York University. As an intern, she says she managed email correspondence, helped draft press releases, and the like. Babysitting on the weekends made ends meet, she said.\u201cBut I was excited about the internship, so I was happy to take it, even unpaid. It was such a powerful experience, and they gave us a lot of really valuable opportunities to contribute to the work they were doing.\u201d Leahy now works at an education nonprofit.\n\nLikewise, Talar Keskinyan scored a Clinton Foundation internship after her freshman year at Wellesley. Her internship had her collect data on the Clinton Foundation\u2019s college partners and provided support to the students based on the data from those surveys.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had a lot of independence and was self-directing, especially for my age and being so early in my college career,\u201d Keskinyan said. To afford the internship, she lived at home on Long Island. \u201cMy parents were paying for my commute.\u201d\n\nThough she didn\u2019t stay at the foundation, she landed a post-graduation job at one of the startups she learned about during her internship.\n\n\u201cTheir internship is probably one of the most well thought out internship programs I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton Foundation\u2019s competitors do pay interns, though,\n\nThe Ford Foundation offers a paid summer internship program and its website boasts that alumni return to work part-time during the school year and that others have been offered full-time positions. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said interns receive a \u201ccompetitive\u201d monthly salary, subsidized housing and \u201cadditional benefits such as use of the foundation\u2019s health clinic and ability to access matching charitable gifts program.\u201d\n\nCourts have historically used six criteria to determine the legality of unpaid internships The Clinton Foundation abides by at least two of them: a mutual understanding about the nature of the arrangement and the idea that an internship is not necessarily a precursor to a job. Furthermore, courts say the intern experience must be of benefit to the intern, something all Clinton Foundation interns who spoke to The Daily Beast said it was.\n\nWhat\u2019s not clear, though, is that the foundation derives no immediate advantage from intern activities. After all, someone has to answer emails, send press releases, and collect data on foundation partners.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation did not respond to repeated requests for comment.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:21.575+0000"}

People like him have lost the argument.\n\nAll they can do now, after years of fostering a climate of prejudice and persecution against LGBTs, is to claim that with the prospect of equality, it is they, the bullies, who are persecuted.\n\nThey cannot argue how equality affects them negatively, so merely claim to be victims.\n\nThis is all they have, after years of using every trick in the book to keep LGBT people unequal, feared, and stigmatized.\n\nIt would be funny, this attempted sleight-of-hand, this laughable co-opting of the language and mantle of victimhood, if Rubio\u2019s words were not so disgusting, and such canards.\n\nOn Tuesday, Rubio dared to use the phrase \u201chate speech\u201d when describing how, one day, those who objected to marriage equality would be seen as propagating hate speech.\n\nDoes Marco Rubio have any idea of the toxicity of the phrase he is flinging around to score some cheap political capital?\n\nDoes he have any idea of the true \u201chate speech\u201d LGBTs have suffered, not just on political platforms at the hands of people like Marco Rubio in their stoking of their Christian voting base\u2014words like \u201cunnatural,\u201d \u201cpretend families,\u201d words of exclusion that seek to put us outside the boundaries of family, home, and love?\n\nBecause \u201chate speech\u201d doesn\u2019t end on political platforms.

Absurdly. You are only labeled a \u201chomophobe\u201d and \u201chater\u201d if you come out and say something homophobic and hateful.\n\nMr. Rubio, despite great provocation by you and others like you, LGBTs and their supporters\u2014many of whom are Christian, by the way\u2014who back equality actually think you can say and think whatever you like, as long as it doesn\u2019t incite violence and hatred. If it does, they will object, as any reasonable person might.\n\nIf you claim that LGBTs do not deserve marriage equality, and your argument has the ring of prejudice about it\u2014and it necessarily would because you are arguing against the principles of equality\u2014then expect to be called out for it.\n\nBut you are not being silenced. You are being disagreed with. And now you\u2019re feeling persecuted because it\u2019s not just LGBTs calling you out on it, but all those who believe people should be treated equally under the law.\n\nSimply, Mr. Rubio, when will you stop scapegoating LGBTs to score votes? Why are you so dead-set on maintaining inequality and discrimination? What\u2019s in it for you? Rubio also said, \u201cAfter they are done going after individuals, the next step is to argue that the teachings of mainstream Christianity, the catechism of the Catholic Church, is hate speech and there\u2019s a real and present danger.\u201d\n\nAgain, this is doom-saying nonsense, and yet another attempt to paint \u201cthe gay agenda\u201d as an uncontrollable monster, out to silence its objectors.\n\nThe truth is that for years LGBTs have had to fight to be heard themselves, to be visible, to lobby for equality under the law.\n\nLGBT activists have never said the teachings of mainstream Christianity or the catechism of the Catholic Church are pernicious. They have argued against those teachings being warped by bigots and opportunists like Mr. Rubio to attack LGBT people, and deny them their civil rights\u2014but not for them to cease to exist or be practiced.\n\nIn a way, Rubio\u2019s nonsensical words are heartening. They are like the last gasp of a poisonous old world order of determined prejudice and discrimination. How furious and scared he must have been to see Catholic Ireland face down the kind of misinformation and lies he and his cronies propagate against LGBTs on Saturday, and vote instead for a future of equality.\n\nRubio and others like him know their grip on fear and prejudice is loosening. And so now, he plays the victim: it\u2019s the last pathetic piece of pantomime left to him.\n\nQuite simply, even Rubio\u2019s followers and supporters know LGBT people\u2014and they do not like to see these family members and loved ones persecuted so viciously for whom they choose to go to bed with.

On the other: the \u201cVoice of God\u201d and his buddy Jack Black.\n\nLawmakers will soon depart the Capitol for a month-long August recess. But as the temperature rises, so does heat on lawmakers who are on the fence about the nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and the major world powers.\n\nCongress has 50 days left to review an agreement that would lift sanctions against Iran in exchange for restrictions on its nuclear program. Over a long, hot month, lawmakers who are on the fence about the deal can expect to be harangued by activists in the District, pressured by op-eds in the hometown paper, and deluged with ads, some of them featuring Hollywood stars.\n\nThe rhetoric has already gone over the top\u2014see GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee\u2019s recent rant about the nuclear agreement leading Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven.\u201d And August hasn\u2019t even begun.\n\nIt could be reminiscent of 2009\u2019s \u201cObamacare Summer,\u201d when activists turned out in droves to oppose the Affordable Care Act. Those activists later coalesced into the Tea Party. The anti-deal crowd is hoping for a similar result.\n\n\u201cWhen members of Congress are back in their districts, they are going to be hearing from people out at dinner, at their offices, and at town hall meetings,\u201d said Josh Block, CEO of the pro-Israel group The Israel Project, which opposes the terms of the current Iran deal.\n\nA new poll conducted for The Israel Project and exclusively obtained by The Daily Beast showed that a majority of voters\u201452 percent\u2014disapprove of President Obama's handling of nuclear negotiations with Iran. Meanwhile, 62 percent want Congress to reject the deal and refrain from lifting sanctions on Iran.\n\nIn the beginning of June, just 30 percent disapproved of the framework agreement with Iran. When nearly 2,000 registered voters were surveyed over the past week, 44 percent now say they disapprove of the agreement.\n\nThen there are the ads. Both proponents and opponents of the Iran deal are ready to put them forward.

The video has garnered more than 200,000 views already.\n\n\u201cThe agreement current on the table is the best way to insure that Iran doesn\u2019t build a [expletive] bomb,\u201d Freeman said. \u201cThe alternative [to the deal] is war.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, opponents of the Iran deal are preparing to blanket the airwaves this summer: Citizens for a Nuclear-Free Iran, an advocacy group formed by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is set to spend between $20 million and $40 million on a national advertising campaign. The campaign, which launched in mid-July and will continue through to September, will be primarily focused on national television but also will run local advertisements that will be seen in some 35 states.\n\n\u201cThe agreement current on the table is the best way to insure that Iran doesn\u2019t build a [expletive] bomb,\u201d Morgan Freeman said.\n\n\u201cThis is a weak deal that would ignite a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, rewards Iran with $150 billion, and strengthens a country with a record of promoting terrorism in the Middle East,\u201d said Citizens for a Nuclear-Free Iran spokesman Patrick Dorton.\n\nBesides supporting Citizens for a Nuclear-Free Iran, AIPAC has \u201ca major lobbying effort in Washington this week with several hundred members, and our members will be meeting with their senators and representatives in their states and districts over the recess,\u201d said an AIPAC source. \u201cWe are engaged in a major bipartisan educational and lobbying effort against the deal and for a better deal.\u201d AIPAC members across the country will attend town halls in their districts to voice their concerns.\n\nHow much will the ad war matter?

{"entityId": 1594, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It\u2019s good to respect people\u2019s feelings, but universities shouldn\u2019t be forcing anyone to use sensitive language.\n\nThe University of Tennessee at Knoxville drew widespread derision last week for publishing a pronoun usage guide that asked students and professors to add the gender-neutral descriptors ze/zir/zirs and xe/xem/xyrs to their vocabularies. Conservatives accused the university of encouraging political correctness run amok, and the left accused the right of callous, lazy disregard for the feelings of transgender students.\n\nIn truth, both accusations contain at least a kernel of wisdom. But whether or not students take kindly to new pronouns, it\u2019s important to remind universities that they have no right to compel members of their campus communities to use sensitive language, even though college administrators across the country are constantly trying to do just that.\n\nThe guide, which appeared on the UT website on August 26, was authored by Donna Braquet, director of the campus\u2019s Pride Center. \u201cWe should not assume someone\u2019s gender by their appearance, nor by what is listed on a roster or in student information systems,\u201d warned Braquet. \u201cTransgender people and people who do not identity within the gender binary may use a different name than their legal name and pronouns of their gender identity, rather than the pronouns of the sex they were assigned at birth.\u201d\n\nBraquet went on to instruct professors to ask students how they wish to be identified on the first day of class. Her post included a graphic that listed gender-neutral pronouns ze/zir/zirs and xe/xem/xyrs alongside the traditional pronouns he/him/his and she/her/hers.\n\nThe First Amendment protects the rights of students at public universities to use whichever pronouns they wish, and it also protects the rights of professors to run their classrooms in any manner they choose.\n\n\u201cIn fact, there are dozens of gender-neutral pronouns,\u201d wrote Braquet. \u201cA few of the most common singular gender-neutral pronouns are they, them, their (used as singular), ze, hir, hirs, and xe, xem, xyr. These may sound a little funny at first, but only because they are new. The she and he pronouns would sound strange too if we had been taught ze when growing up.\u201d\n\nWhat sounded strange to many students was the idea that they would be forced to describe each other using words they had never heard of.\n\n\u201cHow does this make the campus so much more inclusive?\u201d wondered student Michael Hensley, chairman of the campus\u2019s chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, in a statement to The College Fix. \u201cIt\u2019s a certain set of those in academia that have created these words out of nothing.\u201d\n\nThe university countered that adherence to the guide wasn\u2019t mandatory\u2014students and professors would incur no penalty for failing to use gender-neutral pronouns. But this explanation didn\u2019t come quickly enough, and many news sites ran articles contending that the university had formally replaced the words he and she with alien-looking expressions. At least one local Republican politician promised to convene a legislative hearing to look into the matter. In response, University of Tennessee system president Joe DiPietro ordered administrators to take down the web page on pronouns.\n\n\u201cDespite the aggressive efforts by UT Knoxville to communicate the fact that the campus does not require the use of gender-neutral pronouns, I am deeply concerned about the attention this matter continues to receive and the harm it has had on the reputation of the University of Tennessee,\u201d DiPietro said in a statement. \u201cThe social issues and practices raised by the Office for Diversity and Inclusion are appropriate ones for discussion on a university campus. However, it was not appropriate to do so in a manner that suggests it is the expectation that all on campus embrace these practices.\u201d\n\nSupporters of transgender people remained mystified that a harmless suggestion to use inclusive language could be received so poorly. \u201cSociety changes, language changes and today on college campuses, there are increasing numbers of people who specify nontraditional pronouns,\u201d said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, in an interview with Inside Higher Ed. \u201cWhy not respect them?\u201d\n\nIndeed, why not respect them? Certainly, one ought to honor the easily fulfilled wishes of transgender students\u2014or anyone who prefers to go by a nickname, middle name, or some other unobvious term. Professors who ask members of class how they wish to be identified are doing the kind thing, and students who exercise some courtesy when addressing their classmates deserve a pat on the back.\n\nBut what one ought to say and what one is required to say are very, very different things. The First Amendment protects the rights of students at public universities to use whichever pronouns they wish, and it also protects the rights of professors to run their classrooms in any manner they choose. College administrators can\u2019t bully members of campus into adopting different behavior, even if said behavior is generally advisable.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that UT wasn\u2019t actually forcing students to censor their he\u2019s and she\u2019s, the message was sufficiently confusing to make it unclear whether the pronoun guide was a suggestion or a decree. And it\u2019s really no surprise that so many people interpreted Braquet\u2019s advice as an articulation of mandatory campus-wide policy. Universities continuously blur this line when they attempt to spell out their contradictory rules on offensive speech.\n\nThe City University of New York, in fact, told faculty members last January that they should stop using gender-specific salutations like \u201cMr.\u201d and \u201cMs.\u201d in emails to each other and to students. CUNY\u2019s speech requirement was mandatory; administrators maintained that the elimination of gendered language was necessary in order to bring the university in compliance with Title IX, a federal law that requires equality in higher education.\n\nThe idea that Title IX requires such a degree of language policing is preposterous, and would never stand up in court. But university administrators seem very confused about their obligation under the Bill of Rights to take the side of free speech whenever and wherever conflicts with bizarre federal dictates arise.\n\nAll people deserve respect, and the classroom is the ideal place to educate students about new and improved ways to use language to foster human dignity. But that educational duty falls to professors, not university bureaucrats. There\u2019s simply no place for mandatory pronoun policing at institutions that value free speech.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:24.088+0000"}

And I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nChafee doesn\u2019t seem to have an interest in putting together a traditional campaign staff, either. The Chafee 2016 operation consists of two people: Debbie Rich, his communications director who has been with him since 1997, when he was mayor of Warwick, and Jonathan Stevens, his campaign manager and best friend since first grade. Oh, and there\u2019s also \u201ca strong core of loyal volunteers,\u201d according to Rich.\n\nHis foreign policy advisers are mostly \u201cfriends that care about these issues\u201d and \u201cprofessors,\u201d he said.\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s no surprise, then, that he is polling at around 1 percent.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little unusual, what he\u2019s doing,\u201d Michael Trainor, a former Chafee spokesman, told me. \u201cHe\u2019s got a very na\u00efve understanding of running a national campaign. He may just want to have his views on some of these issues register, but the question, to me, is: Does he intend to mount a credible campaign? And I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nChafee was born on March 26, 1953, to an affluent family in Providence, Rhode Island. His great-grandfather, Henry Lippitt, great-great uncle, Charles Warren Lippitt, and father, John Chafee, were all governors of Rhode Island. A Republican, John Chafee left that post, which he held while his son was in elementary school, to be the secretary of the Navy under President Nixon and then, finally, a senator.\n\nFrom his father\u2019s political career, Chafee said, he learned that \u201cthere\u2019s always room for compromise, but if you feel strongly about something and the quest for the compromise is taking you beyond your convictions, it\u2019s not worth it.\u201d\n\nIn the eighth grade, Chafee was elected to his first position: class representative. The following year, he enrolled at Phillips Academy, the boarding school in Andover, Massachusetts. There he became friends with a classmate named Jeb Bush. \u201cIn the 10th grade, we were in a dorm with only 11 students,\u201d Chafee remembered. \u201cIn the course of that year, we got to be good friends, I\u2019d say.\u201d Chafee and Bush talked about politics, he told me: \u201cIt was national issues, then, with Vietnam and so much going on. Both our fathers were Republicans, so we had something in common.\u201d They lost touch after high school, Chafee said, and wouldn\u2019t cross paths again until decades later, in Washington, when Chafee was a senator and Bush the governor of Florida, testifying in front of a committee Chafee served on.\n\nChafee went on to Brown University in Providence. He would admit, during his 1999 campaign for the Senate, that while there, he experimented with cocaine. \u201cI knew the question was going to come up,\u201d Chafee told me. Then, he chuckled: \u201cI wanted to answer it as bluntly as possible.\u201d\n\nAfter graduation, like many young adults in the mid-\u201970s, Chafee wanted to do something different. \u201cI had worked summers in construction as a laborer,\u201d he said. \u201cI always admired the tradespeople and thought after college I wanted to continue that life and get a skill.\u201d He went to a trade school in Montana, where he \u201cgot mildly competent\u201d at horseshoeing and then \u201cvery lucky\u201d when he was hired to work at a racetrack. He ended up in Alberta, Canada, where he remained for seven years. He\u2019s wistful about this time of his life. \u201cI think I put shoes on 5,000 horses,\u201d he said, \u201cI loved it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nChafee returned to Rhode Island and in 1986, he entered politics\u2014a Republican like his father. He was elected to the Warwick City Council, where he would remain until he became mayor, in 1992.\n\nMeanwhile, nationally, the Republican Party began a transformation that would leave little room for politicians like the Chafees. The Clinton era saw Northeastern Republicans and Southern Democrats gradually become endangered species, as the Republican Party anchored itself in the South.\n\n\u201cJust hearing from my dad about that group that came over from the House into the Senate,\u201d Chafee remembered. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have much patience for anybody that wasn\u2019t 100 percent on agenda\u2026It didn\u2019t used to be that way. It got to be pretty militaristic.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a senator and as a secretary of state, you would have to try very hard to find some [Hillary Clinton] accomplishments, and that speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nIn October 1999, the elder Chafee died of congestive heart failure at 77. Obituaries remembered him as the \u201cSenate centrist.\u201d For John Chafee, President Clinton said, \u201ccivility was not simply a matter of personal manners. He believed it was essential to the preservation of our democratic system.\u201d\n\nWhat he learned most from his father, Lincoln Chafee said, was that everything in his political career \u201ccame down to just his courage.\u201d\n\nChafee was appointed to serve the remainder of the Senate term. \u201cI knew when I got in, in 1999, that\u2014uh, a little bit about the atmosphere there and the partisanship,\u201d he said. \u201cI had, I think, a pretty good idea of what I was getting into.\u201d\n\nWhat he got into, it turned out, would make up the entirety of his case for his presidential campaign 15 years later.\n\n***\n\n\u201cEven before the Iraq War, I\u2019d set my course,\u201d Chafee explained. The pro-choice, fiscally conservative, environmentally conscious, endangered species-protecting, skeptical-of-U.S.-military-intervention convictions he held then and now, his \u201cbedrock\u201d convictions, did not align gracefully with the Bush-Cheney doctrine from the start.\n\nHe was cordial with members of his party, he said, and he attended the right lunches and events, but \u201cby the time the Iraq War came, in October 2002, they knew I was a pretty independent voter.\u201d\n\nIn his presidential announcement speech, Chafee outlined the \u201cprimary three\u201d reasons for his decision to become the only Republican senator to vote against the war. The first was his fear that it would be for the next generation what Vietnam had been for his. Second, \u201cI had learned in the nine months of the Bush-Cheney administration prior to September 11 not to trust their word.\u201d Third, the war in Iraq had long been on the \u201chawks\u2019\u201d wish list, and a visit to the CIA convinced him \u201cthere was no intelligence\u201d that made the case for intervention.\n\nThe fact that Hillary Clinton did not arrive at the same conclusion is the central component of Chafee\u2019s campaign platform.\n\n\u201cYou always assume that different things, scenarios, can occur,\u201d Chafee said when I asked if he believed he could win the Democratic nomination. \u201cMy assumption has always been that Secretary Clinton is not going to be the nominee. Different things are going to catch up with her. The Clinton Foundation, the emails, and I\u2019ve always thought the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nIn the current foreign policy debate, Chafee sees the case for Chafee 2016.\n\n\u201cI think as the neocon approach so damaged our American credibility [and] as we saw there were no weapons of mass destruction, and as we saw chaos engulf the region, I suppose that\u2019s when I started thinking, \u2018What this country needs is the people who had the courage, under moments of high pressure, to make good decisions.\u2019\u201d By which Chafee means, of course, someone like him.\n\nJeb Bush, Chafee said, made the Iraq War all the more relevant by saying he would have made the same decision his brother did. \u201cThat\u2019s my issue\u2014where we fit in the world and international approach,\u201d Chafee said.\n\nClinton, he argued, would be \u201ctoo much of a continuation of the Bush-Cheney approach to the world. It\u2019s too much of a continuation of that hawkish approach. There have been several articles about her closeness with the neocons, and that\u2019s my biggest concern.\u201d (Chafee said he mostly reads The New York Times for international coverage.)\n\nAsked how he would handle ISIS, Chafee told me he would not support the airstrikes in Iraq and Syria that have been endorsed by the similarly intervention-apprehensive Rand Paul, who is seeking the Republican nomination. \u201cI call them extra-judicial assassinations,\u201d Chafee said of drone strikes. To combat ISIS, he said, \u201cI believe first we have to understand who they are.\u201d He claimed ISIS is \u201cevolving\u201d from the \u201cabsolute barbarism\u201d that first got the world\u2019s attention.\n\n***\n\nBeyond foreign policy, Chafee told me he wasn\u2019t very impressed by Clinton\u2019s performance in the Senate. \u201cShe liked to go her own way,\u201d he remembered. \u201cYou have to work to get her to compromise, and she likes to do it her way\u2026The truth is, if you look at Hillary Clinton\u2019s career, there aren\u2019t a lot of accomplishments. Certainly, health care back in 1994 is a perfect example. There were a large number of Republicans, my dad being one, that wanted a health-care bill, and she was very uncompromising back then. As a senator and as a secretary of state, you would have to try very hard to find some accomplishments, and that speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nBut it's only on the topic of international relations that Chafee can attempt to differentiate himself from the other candidates \u2013 and even then, it's a stretch to suggest he has something to offer that no one else does. Bernie Sanders voted against the Iraq war, too. Chafee can only argue that his nay was of more consequence and required more courage because of the R- next to his name at the time it was cast.\n\nSo Chafee's bet is this: Clinton will falter, and foreign policy will become so important to Democratic primary voters that he will surpass Martin O\u2019Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore and governor of Maryland who oddly enough helped, while chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, to convince the then-independent Chafee to join the party. (O\u2019Malley\u2019s campaign said he would not be available to discuss the matter) and he will trample Sanders, the much better known Senator from Vermont who is polling competitively with Clinton and who history also shows was correct about Iraq.\n\nFor this to work, Chafee's opposition to the war would need to be compelling enough that no one would bother to notice his record as governor of Rhode Island, which received mixed reviews at best \u2013 something which will only get harder for him as he continues to criticize his opponents. Of O\u2019Malley, Chafee told me, \u201che is going to have some issues\u201d with his policies on crime in Baltimore, which he characterized as \u201ca short-term benefit\u201d whose \u201clong-term effects were dire.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost people think that Linc Chafee was an honest guy who was certainly interested in making the state better, but he lacked the tool kit for strong leadership,\u201d Wendy Schiller, a professor of political science at Brown, told me. \u201cWhen I say the tool kit, I mean he\u2019s not a great public communicator and he\u2019s not interested in horse trading, and when you are governor in a state with a powerful legislature, you have to horse trade.\u201d\n\nPeople grew frustrated with Chafee, Schiller said, because his time in office was \u201cviewed as a wasted opportunity for the state of Rhode Island for four years. I think people will say he\u2019s a nice guy, but they\u2019re very disappointed that he didn\u2019t step up.\u201d\n\nFacing a primary challenge, Chafee decided not to run for a second term. Nevertheless, he told me that he felt like he could leave the office to focus on national and international issues because he had gotten the job done. \u201cI said, \u2018I can leave my governor\u2019s job. We\u2019re going in the right direction in Rhode Island.\u2019\u201d\n\nChafee did admit that he regretted the Christmas tree debate, however.\n\nIn December 2011, Chafee, who is Episcopalian, told a staffer in his office to just use the same tree lightning invitations the previous governor had sent out. They referred, he didn't realize, to a \"holiday tree.\" Chafee ended up being branded \"Governor Grinch\" by a Republican legislator, and told \"They're not happy with you governor!\" by a livid Bill O'Reilly on Fox News.\n\nChafee now says he should have fostered a healthier discussion on the issue, which meant more to Rhode Island's Catholic residents than he realized at the time. Still, he said, \u201cI kind of wanted to call it a holiday tree\u2026 It\u2019s a public building.\u201d\n\n\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:25.056+0000"}
{"entityId": 1596, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Matthew Waxman defended the Geneva Conventions when he was at the Pentagon under President George W. Bush. Now he will defend Obama\u2019s NSA.\n\nMatthew Waxman, a law professor and former senior national security official in the George W. Bush administration, has been tapped to be the next general counsel for the National Security Agency, sources familiar with the matter told The Daily Beast on Friday.\n\nAs the chief legal adviser to the NSA director, the general counsel is on the agency\u2019s senior leadership team and runs an office of more than 100 attorneys who provide legal advice and guidance on surveillance operations. In the wake the Edward Snowden leaks, the general counsel has also been tasked with speaking publicly about the NSA\u2019s actions and defending their legality.\n\nWaxman\u2019s selection hasn\u2019t been announced publicly, but sources told The Daily Beast that he is in the process of gaining security clearance. Waxman declined to comment.\n\n\u201cHe has a deep background in security issues and a reputation for care and moderation in analyzing the legal questions that national security raises,\u201d Stewart Baker, a former NSA general counsel and now a partner at the law firm Steptoe & Johnson, told The Daily Beast.\n\nMatthew Olsen, who also served as the NSA\u2019s general counsel and was later the director of the National Counterterrorism Center, called Waxman \u201ca rigorous thinker who will be an independent voice at the agency.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe general counsel is not a political appointee and isn\u2019t confirmed by the Senate. National security lawyers see it as one of the more coveted posts in government, in large part because of the complex legal issues involved in surveillance operations, and competition for the job is often fierce. Former occupants have come to the NSA from senior positions in the White House and the Justice Department, and they\u2019ve gone on to top posts at law firms or have become security consultants.\n\nWaxman would join the NSA at a pivotal moment. Congress is currently considering changes to the Patriot Act that would modify the agency\u2019s program of collecting Americans\u2019 phone records. That program, which was revealed by Snowden\u2019s leaks, has stoked a now two-year-old debate over the lengths to which U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies should be allowed to go when collecting information on American citizens. On Thursday, a three-judge panel for the Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Patriot Act does not authorize the phone records program.\n\n\u201cHe has a deep background in security issues and a reputation for care and moderation in analyzing the legal questions that national security raises.\u201d\n\nWaxman is highly regarded by his peers within national security law circles. He\u2019s probably best known for his efforts to ensure that U.S. detainees were treated in accordance with the Geneva Conventions, when he was in charge of detainee policy at the Defense Department during the Bush administration. Waxman famously clashed over the issue with David Addington, former Vice President Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff and top legal adviser, and a key architect of some of the Bush administration\u2019s most controversial counterterrorism progress.\n\nIn a lengthy profile of Addington for The New Yorker in 2006, journalist Jane Mayer wrote that \u201cWaxman believed that international standards for the humane treatment of detainees should be followed, and argued for reforms in the Army Field Manual. He hoped to reinstate the basic standards that are specified in the Geneva Conventions. This meant the prohibition of torture, overt acts of violence, and \u2018outrages on personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment.\u2019\u201d\n\nWaxman\u2019s position apparently didn\u2019t sit well with Addington, who Mayer says \u201caccused Waxman of wanting to fight the war on terror his own way, rather than the President\u2019s way.\u201d After the blowout with Addington, Waxman moved from the Pentagon to the State Department, where he served as a senior policy official for then-secretary Condoleezza Rice. In 2007, he left government and became a professor at Columbia Law School.\n\nWaxman continued to be an outspoken voice on detainee issues.\n\nIn a 2010 New York Times article, he criticized the Obama administration for choosing to first prosecute Omar Khadr under revamped rules for military commissions. Khadr, who was 15 when he was captured by U.S. forces, pleaded guilty to war crimes in 2010, including the murder of Sgt. Christopher Speer in Afghanistan eight years earlier. But his case drew criticism in large part over whether it was appropriate to prosecute a child soldier, and because of the coercive nature of Khadr\u2019s interrogation.\n\n\u201cThere is a great deal of international skepticism and hostility toward military commissions, and this is a very tough case with which to push back against that skepticism and hostility,\u201d Waxman told the Times.\n\nKhadr was eventually repatriated to Canada, where he was born, and was released on bail this week while he appeals his conviction in the military tribunal.\n\nWaxman would join a list of NSA general counsels who have come from outside the agency, including his predecessor, Rajesh De, who was the White House Staff Secretary before he joined the agency\u2019s senior ranks. De stepped down in March and is now running the cyber security practice at the law firm Mayer Brown in Washington.\n\nWaxman earned his law degree from Yale Law School and clerked for Justice David Souter on the Supreme Court, as well as Judge Joel Flaum on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. He was also a Fulbright Scholar to the United Kingdom. Prior to working at the Pentagon, he served on the National Security Council staff from 2001 until 2003.\n\nThe NSA declined to comment for this article.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:25.507+0000"}
{"entityId": 1597, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Progressives\u2019 campaign against the Trans-Pacific Partnership is a PR rout. But their fight against Obama\u2019s deal undermines the very causes they support.\n\nSomebody with significant resources really hates the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n\nImmediately after the midterm elections, Democratic voters got emails saying the proposed 12-nation trade agreement would steal our sovereignty, damage the economy, make products unsafe, wreck the environment, jack up the costs of medicine, and subvert economic justice. From nothing in October 2014, social media is now filled with the same messages posted by activists across the globe, from California to New Zealand. Twenty-seven of the top 30 hits for a Google search for \u201cTPP\u201d are slick opposition web pages with the same messages. The only pro-TPP page the comes up is banal boilerplate from the U.S. government trade negotiation authority.\n\nIn the world of public relations, this is a rout. Who has the resources to mount such a coordinated campaign? Why are they spending so much to attack one of President Obama\u2019s top diplomatic priorities? And why is no one mounting a counter-campaign to defend the TPP?\n\nThe answer emerges from the top TPP hit on Google, an op-ed posted Tuesday by a lobbyist for U.S. domestic manufacturers. The lobbyist, who has read recent TPP drafts as part of his Democratic lobbying work, is outraged that Obama negotiators \u201cdismiss individuals like me who believe that, first and foremost, a trade agreement should promote the interests of domestic producers and their employees.\u201d\n\nThis candid statement puts the anti-TPP campaign squarely in historical context. Powerful domestic interests have opposed free trade from before the U.S. Constitution was ratified and continued to oppose trade deals like Bill Clinton\u2019s NAFTA negotiations in the 1990s. The beneficiaries of free trade\u2014from the jobless who might get jobs, to the low-income consumers who benefit from cheaper products, to the high-poverty regions of the developing world that would benefit from exporting to U.S. consumers\u2014just don\u2019t have the same public relations resources. But although the social media campaign is an anti-TPP rout, its substantive arguments are profoundly at odds with progressive traditions.\n\nStart with the widespread but absurd claim that the TPP is being negotiated \u201cin secret.\u201d The TPP will be public before the U.S. Congress votes to approve it, so our citizens will have legislative review of this agreement. The only constraint is that Congress will have to vote \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d rather than offering amendments. This procedural rule reduces domestic lobbying, yes, but it has been used to advance Democratic causes in the past, such as shrinking wasteful military expenses by closing unneeded domestic military bases.\n\nThe social media campaign may be an anti-TPP rout, but its substantive arguments are profoundly at odds with progressive traditions.\n\nDemocrats who argue that the deal should be public now, during negotiations, should consider the precedent that would set. If multilateral negotiations have to take place in front of C-SPAN cameras, international progress would cease on a host of causes Democrats support, from environmental coordination to peace treaties. Outside interests can always publicize certain aspects of the deal and deliver focused public opposition to those specific provisions. Those who claim to seek more transparency are really trying to sabotage the substantive deal itself. That is why Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) pushed so hard for extensive congressional review of Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. Indeed, no one on the political left seems to notice the irony that Cotton and AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka are both arguing that Obama should be given less negotiating authority.\n\nWhat about the claim that the deal violates international sovereignty by creating a separate judicial review procedure? Well, it appears that progressives have forgotten their historic support for the United Nations, or the international criminal court at The Hague, or a whole host of other cross-border agreements. If an international agreement is going to mean anything, it has to come with a dispute resolution mechanism that necessarily gets some authority delegated to an international body. No nation loses any of its ultimate sovereignty, as that delegation can always be revoked; any nation can withdraw from international agreements at any time.\n\nAnd what about the substance itself? Putting aside the fringe claims, the basic argument is that the TPP opens our markets to countries that damage their environments, as well as underpaying and mistreating their workers. TPP critics claim the deal encourages those foreign nations to keep doing those bad things and hurts U.S. workers by forcing them to compete \u201cunfairly\u201d with nations that do not abide by our environmental and safety rules.\n\nA review of the history, evidence, and social justice of free trade overwhelmingly rebuts those claims.\n\nFirst of all, opening our markets to developing countries helps the world\u2019s poorest people. China is only one of many examples of countries that have reduced their own poverty by specializing in producing goods for export. Global inequality has gone down dramatically over the past several decades as trade agreements have brought prosperity to more poor regions.\n\nSecond, as formerly poor nations become more prosperous through trade, their citizens choose to invest in goods that make the world a better place. Country after country, including the United States, enacted environmental improvements and labor safeguards as they became more prosperous. The best thing America can do for the world is use our markets to help more poor nations follow this path of progress.\n\nThird, the deal directly and immediately benefits the United States. If another country is doing low-wage work, that frees up the United States to do more high-wage work. A great example is sugar. Sugar tariffs may protect U.S. sugar manufacturers, but they hurt U.S. confectioners and candy-makers. If we drop sugar tariffs, we encourage growth in the latter industries\u2014and those industries can support better wages and jobs for America.\n\nFinally, the Democratic Party should be the party of optimism and the future. The country\u2019s demographics favor our agenda and our brand. Most of the member nations of the TPP already have tariff agreements with the United States. The major focus of the TPP negotiations is to bring China, Japan, the United States, and other nations into alignment on services and intellectual property. These are the industries of the future and the industries in which U.S. innovation gives us an advantage. We should have the confidence to embrace a deal that expands the global markets for such industries, especially when the deal is being negotiated by a president of our own party.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:25.797+0000"}
{"entityId": 1598, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Iranian Americans are (mostly) celebrating. Syrian Americans, uh, not so much. A quick survey of an important but under-covered segment.\n\nWe have heard from just about everyone on the Iran deal, from President Obama to Donald Trump to Benjamin Netanyahu to many, many in between. But how do Muslim Americans view the deal? I\u2019m sure many non-Muslims are thinking that they are all cheering it because the deal helps Iran. Well, anyone holding that view clearly doesn\u2019t know too many Muslim Americans.\n\nOn Tuesday, I reached out to a wide cross section of Muslim Americans about their views on the deal with Iran, from community leaders to religious clerics to even a well-known Iranian American comedian. Overall their responses can best be summed up as cautious optimism. But the regional divide we see amongst Muslims in the Middle East was also present in the reactions of these Muslim Americans.\n\nFirst off, the Iranian-American Muslims I contacted were in general very excited at the prospect of the United States and Iran fostering better relations. Sarah Sakha, a \u201cproud\u201d first-generation Iranian American, explained to me via Facebook that the deal \u201chonestly gives Iranians and Iranian-Americans all around the world hope.\u201d She added, \u201cAnd now, under the framework, the U.S. can enjoy Iranian pistachios, the ultimate peace offering!\u201d\n\nMaz Jobrani, the best-known Iranian American comedian in the United States, explained by email that the deal \u201cis a great thing for both the Iran and America. I\u2019m especially happy for the Iranian people because the lifting of the sanctions should be a great relief to them.\u201d He added, \u201cIt\u2019s a good day when diplomacy wins.\u201d\n\nWhile Iranian American filmmaker Negin Farsad was very supportive of the deal, she noted that it \u201cwas tantamount to Iran submitting to an anal cavity search all the time.\u201d Farsad urged Republican lawmakers to \u201cnot take a knee-jerk anti-peace stance\u201d and instead \u201clook at Iran as a potential new market to sell American goods, rather than a new war front.\u201d\n\nMuslim Americans of South Asian backgrounds were universally supportive of the deal, although some expressed caution. Imam Shamsi Ali, who is based in New York City, was \u201cvery happy to hear that there is a hopeful, peaceful solution to the conflict, as opposed to war.\u201d Wajahat Ali, a journalist and author, echoed Ali\u2019s sentiments, noting that the deal \u201cis a positive step towards reconciliation between the United States and Iran.\u201d But, he added, \u201cIt will take years for the two nations to trust each after decades of mistrust and fear.\u201d\n\nMansoor Shams, a former U.S. Marine, commented via social media, \u201cThis deal proves through mutual respect peace can be achieved.\u201d And while supportive of the deal, some others, like journalist Haroon Moghul, were resigned to the fact that \u201cthe only other option is war with Iran, and such a war would be far more challenging for us than the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\u201d\n\nFinally, the African American Muslims I contacted too were supportive. For example, Margari Aziza Hill of the Muslim Anti-Racism Collaborative stated, \u201cI think this is a promising moment and I look forward to cultural and intellectual exchanges between our respective nations and greater stability in the region.\u201d (My apologies to the other Muslim American communities I could not include here but there are too many at this point!)\n\nAnother Syrian American told me, \u201cEnding Iran\u2019s human-rights abuses against its people and stopping the slaughter of Syrians should have been the first precondition to any deal.\u201d\n\nBut, and whenever you are dealing with issues in the Middle East, there is always a but, some Muslim Americans deeply questioned how much we could trust Iran and some went further than that. The most vocal opponents to the deal were Syrian Americans. As most are aware, the Iranian government has been supporting Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war where he has slaughtered more than 100,000 Syrian civilians in the past four years.\n\nSarab Al-Jijakli, president of the Network of Arab American professionals, expressed the sentiment of many Syrian American Muslims: \u201cThere is a concern that this deal is a green light for Iran to expand its bloody foreign intervention in Syria to ensure the survival of the Assad regime.\u201d\n\nOther Syrian Americans were even more critical. Said one: \u201cThis gives the Iranian government a chance to pour even more money into Syria to continue the slaughter they have been backing.\u201d And another Syrian American told me, \u201cEnding Iran\u2019s human-rights abuses against its people and stopping the slaughter of Syrians should have been the first precondition to any deal,\u201d adding that, \u201cthis deal is good for Iranian people, bad for the greater Middle East and the world.\u201d\n\nIt should be noted that Assad has publicly applauded the Iran deal, further adding to their concerns this deal will help him stay in power. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has done the same.\n\nFinally, I spoke with a Palestinian American who was born and raised in Israel, is an Israeli citizen, and still has a large family in Israel. He clearly didn\u2019t trust the Iranians. While he didn\u2019t believe Iran would ever launch a nuclear strike at Israel, his concern was that the extra money Iran stands to see with the lifting of sanctions could translate into Iran funding even more terrorism.\n\nMy view of the deal is very similar. I say that because I, too, have many Palestinian relatives in the West Bank. And my fianc\u00e9e is an Israeli citizen (she is Palestinian by heritage). So if Iran ever dropped a nuclear bomb on Israel, many members of my family would be killed. Although I doubt that would happen, given that the punishment for Iran truly would be the end of Iran as a nation. But Iran could use the additional revenue when the sanctions are lifted to expand its influence in the region and wreak even more havoc.\n\nWe don\u2019t know if Iran will live up to its obligations under the new agreement. But if you believe in diplomacy over war, then don\u2019t you need to at least give peace a chance?", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:25.931+0000"}

Instead of giving his imprimatur to one main super PAC, which is the norm, Cruz has four officially sanctioned super PACs: Keep the Promise PAC, Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II, and Keep the Promise III. National Review reported that this set-up is designed to give individual billionaires and their families maximal control over how their cash gets spent.\n\nAnd there\u2019s the rub. FEC filings show that those four PACs, combined, have taken in a healthy $39 million\u2014but only spent a teeny tiny little fraction of that on the senator\u2019s presidential efforts. And one of the PACs actually donated to one of Cruz\u2019s 2016 rivals.\n\nThis news comes as Cruz faces lackluster poll numbers and less than a week before the first GOP debate. RealClearPolitics\u2019 average gives him just 5.2 percent of the vote, lagging behind fellow conservative firebrands Rand Paul and Ben Carson. And a recent Fox News poll showed his support among likely Republican primary voters got cut in half since mid-March\u2014from 10 percent to just 4 percent.\n\nAnd while Cruz\u2019s PACs have kept their powder dry, other 2016 contenders\u2019 backers are spending big. The Conservative Solutions Project spent seven figures on TV ads touting Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s record on Iran, per the Tampa Bay Times. And, according to the Cincinnati Enquirer, the John Kasich-backing New Day for America has already spent $1.7 million blanketing New Hampshire televisions with ads touting the Ohio governor\u2019s record.\n\nCandidates who aren\u2019t running for president are getting similar boosts; Pat Toomey, a vulnerable Republican senator in Pennsylvania, is benefitting from a $1.5 million TV, direct mail, and digital video ad campaign from Concerned Veterans for America.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cruz\u2019s own super PAC hedging against him before the first debate,\u201d said the Republican insider.\n\nBut Ted Cruz doesn\u2019t seem to be getting that kind of love. And in his home state, it\u2019s raised a few eyebrows.\n\n\u201cAre these people really planning to spend this money?\u201d queried one Texas Republican insider, adding that he thought the super PACs\u2019 gun-shy approach to spending was \u201cbizarre.\u201d\n\nSo while Cruz has made a host of positive headlines for the cash that his supporting super PACs have raked in, he doesn\u2019t actually seem to have benefitted much from their largesse.\n\nFirst off, there\u2019s Keep the Promise I, a PAC that gets the bulk of its cash from billionaire investor Robert Mercer. In this quarter of the year, the PAC took in more than $11 million and spent only $536,169.90. The kicker? Of that $536,169.90, a sweet five hundred grand went to a super PAC backing Carly Fiorina\u2014who, of course, is also running for president. Against Cruz.\n\nCNN, which first reported on Carly\u2019s PAC\u2019s money, called the contribution \u201cunusual,\u201d which is certainly a nice way to put it. Of the remaining $36,000 that the PAC spent, $20,000 went to a D.C.-based polling company. The remaining $16,169.90 went to Bracewell and Giuliani LLP for legal consulting. So from April through July of this year, the biggest benefactor of a putatively pro-Cruz super PAC was Carly Fiorina.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Cruz\u2019s own super PAC hedging against him before the first debate,\u201d said the Republican insider.\n\nThen there\u2019s Keep the Promise II\u2014funded solely by a $10 million donation from Toby Neugebauer, son of Rep. Randy Neugebauer\u2014and Keep the Promise III, funded by the fracking-enriched Wilks family. Those two PACs, combined, raised $25 million this quarter. Keep the Promise II didn\u2019t spend anything, and Keep the Promise III spent just $5,025.\n\nFinally, there\u2019s the Keep the Promise PAC, which doesn\u2019t appear to be dominated by one major donor or donor family. It brought in a comparatively modest $1.8 million this quarter and spent about $97,000. Most of that went to covering legal fees, software, and media production. The PAC also spent $1,698.39 at an Austin Apple Store on a computer. This all means that while this PAC looks like it\u2019s been busier than the other three, it\u2019s still not doing a whole lot.\n\nCruz\u2019s atypical super PAC situation was designed to give donors more control over how their money got spent. But no one anticipated that these donors would be so stingy\u2014except when it comes to boosting a Cruz competitor.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:27.075+0000"}
{"entityId": 1600, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "You may think you\u2019ve learned enough about the businessman turned GOP presidential front-runner. Make sure you get to know the real Trump first.\n\nTrumped out?\n\nToo blurry-eyed with Trump fatigue to stomach another Donald piece?\n\nYeah, it\u2019s unending. And confusing. Trump has managed to turn the media world upside down. Establishment voices like Maureen Dowd in The New York Times write columns that go easy on the bombastic and baldly misogynist billionaire, while Megyn Kelly, the Venus fly trap of Fox News, catches him like a bug and makes him bleed.\n\nBut knowing the real Trump could be important. While lots of Republicans would like to dismiss him as a gaudy sideshow whose run won\u2019t last until the Republican National Convention in July 2016, his candidacy may have more staying power than a pack of pundits first thought. At least Warren Buffett thinks so.\n\nSo what to make of the man behind this enormously entertaining political reality show? Is he a shamelessly self-obsessed, self-promoter without a shred of principle and without a trace of class? Or is he a truth-telling American original who spews contempt for the political correctness that makes so many of us drowsy with banal politics-as-usual?\n\nWithout malice, name-calling, or demeaning physical characterizations, here are three anecdotes about the mogul-who-would-be-president that you haven\u2019t heard before. Depending on your point of view, they may or may not be revealing. But they will help you take your own measure of the man.\n\nStory One: In the early 1990s, when I was working at BusinessWeek, we ran stories about Trump\u2019s financial woes that suggested his wealth was a lot of smoke and mirrors. One story especially angered him, and a fuming Donald stormed into our offices on Sixth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan and spent hours ranting at the reporter/writer, the senior editor, the editor in chief, and the general counsel for McGraw-Hill, which then owned the magazine.\n\nHere\u2019s what the writer, Larry Light, recalls in an email:\n\n\u201cEssentially, what happened was Donald finally blew his stack when I published a story about his latest attempt to get out of the hole. Before, he had ignored my other stuff about him. This time, the story focused on his investment in something called the Hotel New Japan in Tokyo, which had burned down under suspicious circumstances. Nobody suggested he had anything to do with the fire. My point was simply that the guy was trying anything. As our stories had demonstrated, he was on the ropes financially. (I knew he\u2019d eventually come back: He was too big to fail\u2014and say what you want, Trump is a good businessman.)\n\n\u201cAnyway, I got a phone call from him saying: \u2018I\u2019m gonna sue your ass off.\u2019\n\n\u201cA few days later, he charged into the office of [Editor in Chief Stephen Shepard] with lawyers. I was there, along with Senior Editor Deidre Depke, Steve, and Ken Vittor, corporate counsel for McGraw-Hill.\n\n\u201cTrump launched into a three-hour diatribe about how rich he really was and how I was jealous of him.\n\n\u201c[In regards to his finances], I told him: \u2018You don\u2019t have it, Donald.\u2019 I had access to his financials (I can\u2019t say how), so I knew I was on solid ground. At the time, he had a negative net worth.\n\n\u201cI also said I wasn\u2019t jealous of him and viewed him as a subject of news interest only.\n\n\u201cThen he took exception to my reference to his \u2018tacky image.\u2019 To show he was a man of station in society, he said he had just been admitted to some WASP-y club. I don\u2019t remember the name. \u2018Larry Light couldn\u2019t get in there,\u2019 he said, emphasizing my name.\n\nWas this an implication I was Jewish? Or just not a high society type? Probably the latter. I am not Jewish, for one thing. But I am a WASP. So I said: \u2018I dunno, Donald. I\u2019m an Episcopalian.\u2019 That was the line that went around the floor of BusinessWeek.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he took exception to my reference to his \u2018tacky image.\u2019 To show he was a man of station in society, he said he had just been admitted to some WASP-y club.\u201d\n\n[Another participant in the meeting remembers thinking that Trump\u2019s remark was less subtly anti-Semitic; that he had assumed Light was Jewish and that what he meant about Light not being a candidate for the club was that Light\u2019s religion would preclude him from consideration.]\n\n\u201cFinally, Ken Vittor, our lawyer, said to Trump: \u2018Donald, you can sue us if you want. But realize that we will have the power of discovery. And the whole world will know what your finances are.\u2019\n\n\u201cTrump had drawn up legal papers but had never filed them. After Ken\u2019s comment and seeing we weren\u2019t going to be cowed, Trump left and the lawsuit somehow never saw the light of day.\u201d\n\nAll that was a long time ago, to be sure, though there are familiar components to the story, especially the braggadocio and the attempt to intimidate a journalist. Was Trump\u2019s reaction simply that of an aggrieved and righteous investor or the lashing out of a bully willing to say and suggest anything when called out?\n\nYour call.\n\nStory Two: Trump has rightly railed against the fast-and-loose business behavior of the United States\u2019 economic rival, China, a travesty in which Corporate America has unpatriotically colluded. In 2011, he said: \u201cChina is doing great. China is now the No. 1 producer in the world of wind and solar power. They now possess the fastest supercomputer on the entire globe. China also now has the world\u2019s fastest train and the world\u2019s biggest high-speed rail network. Most Americans don\u2019t realize that China is literally kicking the crap out of us.\u201d\n\nBut Hong Kong Chinese money helped bankroll the building of a string of glitzy high-rise apartments that run along the Hudson on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side and carry the Trump name in gold letters.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, I happened to be living in a first-floor apartment of a landmark building on 72nd Street that looked out on the rail sidings and empty lots where the Trump buildings would be built, the last undeveloped stretch of Manhattan, then known as Penn Yards. [Full disclosure: One of those buildings later completely obliterated my view of the Hudson and all light on one side of my former apartment.]\n\nAt that time, the far west end of 72nd Street was a virtual cul-de-sac because the entrance to the West Side Highway had been temporarily blocked off. One morning, I peered out my front windows, which looked out on the cul-de-sac and Riverside Park, to see a limousine pull up. A chauffeur opened the passenger door and out emerged Donald Trump and a squat, powerfully built Asian man.\n\nTrump spent 15 or 20 minutes talking and gesturing expansively toward the lots where the buildings would later go up with the swiftness of a Potemkin village. To a nosy observer, he appeared to be trying to sell the Asian man on something.\n\nA 1994 story in the Times about the project, then referred to as Riverside South, said this: For the Cheng family, which owns one of Hong Kong\u2019s biggest real estate and development conglomerates \u201c\u2026Donald J. Trump was not a rival but merely a target of opportunity. Mr. Trump first sketched out the plan for developing the 75-acre site along the Hudson River, blocks from Lincoln Center, but his recent financial problems allowed the Hong Kong group to buy his $250 million debt on the land for a bargain price of some $90 million and take over Riverside South.\n\nConstruction could start within a year, and Mr. Trump will share in the profits. But people familiar with the Chengs\u2019 operations agree that they, not Mr. Trump call the shots.\u201d\n\nSo does the fact that Trump was a front man for Chinese money, which underwrote the enormous project, make his later criticism of China disingenuous?\n\nYou decide.\n\nStory Three: About 15 years ago, I had occasion to consult with a fancy Upper East Side dental surgeon who specialized in cosmetic work. The circumstances are unimportant, though he did notice that I was getting older and might want to consider implants or veneers since he said I had made my teeth considerably smaller over the years by grinding them. An occupational hazard, I guess.\n\nThe dentist was momentarily called away, and when he returned to the conference room where I waited, he had a set of teeth molds in his hand.\n\n\u201cDo you know what these are?\u201d he asked with a smirk. Then, without waiting for an answer, added: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s teeth.\u201d\n\nThe dentist said Trump would come to the office every six months or so complaining that his veneers weren\u2019t white enough.\n\n\u201cI tell him that if they are too white, they won\u2019t look real,\u201d the dentist said, as I recall, \u201cbut he won\u2019t listen. So he picks a shade, and I make them about one-quarter as white as the shade he selects, and he goes away happy.\u201d\n\nI took his story with a scrape of plaque since he seemed a bit of a salesman himself. But as he walked me down the hall, he motioned with his eyes to an examining room. The door was open and I could see the back of a famous head of hair in the dentist\u2019s chair.\n\nSo what\u2019s the takeaway? Self-absorption of the highest order or just a celebrity who likes to look his gleaming best?\n\nAgain, your call.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:27.410+0000"}
{"entityId": 1601, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "How a fight with my wife between two vacation destinations explains the appeal of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.\n\nMy wife and I are planning our first proper vacation in more than three years. The gap between trips is not by choice; it\u2019s just one of those things that happens when you\u2019re busy and you let life go along like everything is fine, then one morning you wake up to this nagging feeling\u2014the gnat-like annoyance of business-as-usual and the unbearable monotony of each day and week melting into the next with no discernable difference between them. You are overcome by the urge to reboot and recharge.\n\nUnfortunately, when this epiphany finally occurs my wife and I usually have only a few days to get our act together, and our vacation plans inevitably default to an old stand-by: the Mayan Riviera, between Cancun and Playa del Carmen, where we got married.\n\nBut this year, this time, was going to be different. We weren\u2019t just going to procrastinate until the last minute and take the flight path of least resistance down to the Yucatan peninsula. We were both wrapping up big work projects at around the same time\u2014she was piloting a re-org project at her company, I have two books that I worked on coming out\u2014and we finally had some time to really weigh our options and plan our great escape.\n\nWe started by making a list of the three or four places we\u2019ve always wanted to see and then ranking them against one another. We only had two governing rules: 1) they had to be different (so no Paris or London) and 2) they couldn\u2019t be too difficult to travel to (so no Antarctica or North Korea).\n\nCuba topped my list: \u201cHoney, Cuba is perfect. They speak a language I\u2019m generally conversant in so we\u2019ll be able to get around pretty well. It\u2019s close enough to where we live and where we usually go for vacation that we can get out easily if something happens. Plus they all drive around in cool old American cars and they\u2019re obsessed with baseball! It\u2019s quirky, old-timey and cool.\u201d\n\nMy wife was unmoved: \u201cAnd socialist.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally just in name only, though.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not in name only. They\u2019re actual socialists.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess, but we\u2019re opening embassies in each other\u2019s countries. What do you think is going to happen, we go to a resort and they confiscate our wealth?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, but I don\u2019t want to find out.\u201d My wife is a little more conservative about these things than I am.\n\n\u201cOkay fine, then what\u2019s at the top of your list?\u201d\n\nHer idea: Greece.\n\nI confess that this suggestion was met, not with silence, but instead with a loud, involuntary guffaw.\n\n\u201cGreece is in total disarray. They\u2019re the laughingstock of Europe. Even the Italians are like, \u2018geez guys, show a little discipline for once in your lives.\u2019 They\u2019re about to get kicked out of the EU!\u201d\n\nMy wife was undeterred: \u201cGreece isn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d\n\nShedding the pretense and the bullshit niceties and just kind of doing and being what you want to do and be? It\u2019s an intoxicating idea.\n\nBesides down the toilet, Greece has become an international joke. They possess a breathtaking inability to self-regulate. For decades the entire nation has hurtled itself toward the precipice of expulsion from the international order. And for what, an Olympics and 20,000 swimming pools?\n\nI made each of these points in turn. They were apparently inconsequential to Greece\u2019s suitability as a vacation destination. \u201cThe islands are stunningly gorgeous\u2014Santorini, Mykonos, Crete, Corfu. Greece has been at the center of western civilization for millennia. You love history. Just think about all those amazing relics in Athens: the Parthenon on the Acropolis, the Agora, the Temple of Hephaestus, the\u2014\u201c\n\n\u201c\u2014filth and crime that has been allowed to take root by a bunch of tax-evading, ethically flexible garbage people.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cAthens is a hellhole!\u201d This is not my opinion, mind you. I\u2019ve never been. This was the conclusion drawn from first-hand reporting by some of our Greek friends who travel back to the Motherland every year. So obviously, it is unassailable.\n\nIt became clear very quickly that we were not going to convince each other of our top vacation spots. Instead of fighting, we went down the rest of our lists searching for compromise (it only took six years of marriage to figure this part out). The objections we had to the remainder of each other\u2019s choices were less immediately violent and complete, but they were enough to knock a lot of the luster off places we already weren\u2019t that excited about after having our top choices shredded and scattered to the wind.\n\nSlowly we began to realize what we were really doing: by process of elimination, we were talking ourselves back into our old stand-by: the comfortable, familiar, unthreatening Mayan Riviera. I couldn\u2019t believe it. We began this whole process determined to avoid the same old story and find some place new. Yet here we were, asking ourselves: \u201cAre we really going to do this again?\u201d\n\nWatching the first GOP debates this past Thursday night, then flipping back and forth between the cable news spin zones as they spun the spin coming out of the spin zone backstage at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, it dawned on me that my wife and I are locked in the same struggle that the American electorate is having with itself over this cycle\u2019s crop of candidates\u2014from both sides of the aisle.\n\nAre there honestly people out there excited about pulling the trigger for Hillary Clinton or Jeb Bush? I don\u2019t think so. We know those comfortable, familiar names will always be there come Election Day. Of that we can be sure. Dynasties don\u2019t develop by disappearing from our consciousness.\n\nBut with fifteen month to go, and plenty of time to weigh our options between now and then, we luxuriate in this consequence-free period and indulge our romantic desire for someone new, someone willing to speak the uncomfortable truths, someone with fresh ideas and less baggage\u2014or at least less familiar baggage. They\u2019re all just so new and exciting and full of possibility.\n\nAnd thus, onto the scene and up the polls have stormed Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump\u2014the Cuba and Greece of candidates, respectively.\n\nThe independent junior senator from Vermont, Bernie Sanders, looks like Doc Brown from Back to the Future if he was both a rabbi and a muppet. He\u2019s been around for decades, operating and instigating at the periphery of American politics, but until this year his voice has failed to break through the national noise. Instead, he has been more like your Crazy Uncle Bernie\u2014the cool relative you see only at holidays who stirs up trouble talking his Leftist politics at the dinner table in between daredevil stories about living through the \u201860s and eating stale pot brownies with Grateful Dead roadies in a van somewhere outside Des Moines.\n\nThe thing about Crazy Uncle Bernie is that what makes him so alluring as a character is that much of what he says makes sense and appeals to your sense of equity and fairness. Supporters and most moderate commentators will tell you that he has reasonable positions on guns, healthcare, campaign finance reform, and privacy. He has long held positions that the more politically opportunistic and less morally courageous among his colleagues are just now coming around to.\n\nAll of this is to say there is something very intriguing and romantic about Bernie Sanders. If you stop the analysis there, Bernieland, like Cuba, seems like it could actually be a nice place for an extended vacation. But then someone reminds you of stuff like earlier this year, when he strongly, publicly recommended that President Obama unilaterally close some tax loopholes (effectively raising taxes) through executive action, and you start to ask yourself: \u201cHe really is a socialist, isn\u2019t he?\u201d Or you do your own bit of Google sleuthing, learn that he was born two months before Pearl Harbor, and then do the math: \u201cHoly crap, he\u2019ll be 75 when he takes the Oath of Office if he wins.\u201d\n\nSure, these are only two tiles in the brilliant mosaic that makes up Bernie Sanders, the independently progressive politician. But, as the argument goes, they are tiles from the outline of Bernie Sanders the man; defining its shape and structure and what can fit within its borders. If he\u2019ll willingly do something like levy unilateral tax reform, what else might he do as President? Give him enough of a mandate, and if he manages to survive a re-election campaign, he might actually remodel the Oval Office and turn it into a circle, just so everything is equal distance from the center. If there is anything more un-American than that, I haven\u2019t seen it.\n\nThen there is Donald Trump\u2014a man who seems like he\u2019s managed to turn five minutes of fame into five decades of infamy. At some level, you have to be impressed by his longevity. He has been a regular call-in guest on the Howard Stern Show for years. He has a big black jumbo jet that he parks conspicuously on the tarmac at LaGuardia so all the business travelers who fly in and out of New York through that airport every day are sure to see it.\n\nHe has owned the Miss USA and Miss Universe pageants since 1996\u2014personally holding its winners accountable to the exacting standards that he himself has set for the organizations. And, until he unceremoniously took a dump on 1/3rd of North America, he had been in a highly lucrative business relationship with NBCUniversal for more than a decade.\n\nThere is no denying that, for a large portion of the American population, there is something magnetic about Donald Trump. By virtue of the number of zeros in his net worth (9), and the number of fucks he gives about what anybody thinks (0)\u2014as evidenced by his responses to Megyn Kelly and half his debate competitors on Thursday\u2014Trump has crafted this unusual persona that allows him to get away with being generally repugnant because he is saying offensive things that many people deeply believe but will only say to themselves in private. He is exciting, no-holds barred, unapologetic.\n\nWho isn\u2019t at least a little curious about what spending some time in that kind of environment might be like? Shedding the pretense and the bullshit niceties and just kind of doing and being what you want to do and be? It\u2019s an intoxicating idea.\n\nThen you remember: oh yeah, Donald Trump is a total garbage person.\n\nFor decades he has been making big, swinging-dick bets on his own power and genius, using equal parts swagger and debt. Whether it\u2019s office buildings and mixed-use towers in cities like New York and Chicago, or casinos and resorts in places like Atlantic City and Honolulu, Trump has buried mountains of other people\u2019s money into the foundation pilings of eponymously-titled real estate all over the map\u2014money that is easy to point to, but hard to get out.\n\nHe has the unique privilege of being one of the few private citizens in modern history to amass a personal fortune in the billions while also driving four of his companies into bankruptcy. An achievement usually reserved for dictators, whose countries are the ones going insolvent.\n\nIn a sense, Donald Trump is very much the Greece of the field: an antiquated cultural icon full of bluster and self-importance, ringed by a bunch of beautiful, sparkly oases of luxury that serve primarily to feed delusions of grandeur and distract from the rotting sore festering at the core. If that sounds overly harsh\u2014about Greece, I mean\u2014consider this chart from an article on The Independent website a few weeks ago about a survey done by the Pew Research Center that asked Europeans their view on the character of some of the continent\u2019s constituent nations. Nearly every country surveyed saw Germans as the most hardworking and trustworthy people in Europe. That is, except for Greece, which viewed Greeks and the most hardworking and trustworthy.\n\nAs with Sanders on the Democratic side, throwing your lot in with Donald Trump this far out from Election Day is a consequence-free choice. It\u2019s fun to think about a State of the Union address given by the physical embodiment of Krusty the Clown. It\u2019s invigorating to think about a President occupying the White House who calls in the heads of state from nations who have been a pain in our ass for years and fires them. It\u2019s very easy to give yourself over to the romance and hysteria of the knight in shining armor riding to victory on his or her un-self-consciously dark horse.\n\nTo see this phenomenon in action, just look at the Iowa Straw Poll. Generally considered the first real electoral event of the campaign season for the Republican Party, the late-summer gathering could not be less consequential if the winner were crowned in a single-elimination dodgeball tournament using t-shirt cannons and frozen ears of corn. Since first being held in 1979, only once has the eventual Republican nominee won the straw poll outright (George W. Bush in 1999).\n\nDo you know who won last cycle? Michele Bachmann. Think about that for a minute. Ron Paul came in second. Mitt Romney, the eventual nominee, finished seventh! Tim Pawlenty finished third with four times as many votes as Romney and he basically got bullied into running by the press. The impotency of the Iowa Straw Poll is due in no small part to the fact that it takes place six months before the Iowa caucuses and fifteen months before the general election. It\u2019s equal parts wish fulfillment and derring-do, but without any of the daring or the doing because the votes carry zero weight (or consequences). Recognizing this, the GOP announced wisely last month that the straw poll would no longer be held.\n\nMaybe that\u2019s what my wife and I need to do. Maybe we should cancel all this advanced planning, all this information-light but emotion-heavy advocacy for vacation spots we still know very little about. A lot can happen between now and the fall.\n\nMaybe someone whose opinion we trust will hip us to a spot we hadn\u2019t considered. Maybe the world blows up as the summer enflames simmering tensions all over the globe. Maybe a spot that used to be popular and then fell out of vogue for awhile does interesting internal improvements to appeal to undecided vacationers (this is the John Kasich option).\n\nWho knows? The uncertainty of it all only tugs lightly at the conscience right now, but the closer we get to booking flights and hotels the more the gravity of being wrong weighs us down. Nothing is going to happen, probably. But if it does\u2026\n\nAfter watching both debates, and the spin from backstage, and the spin of the spin on cable news shows, and then the Friday morning debate post-mortems, my wife and I settled on the general unelectability and frightening unsuitability of virtually everyone in the presidential field. Not ten minutes later my father-in-law called to commiserate and relitigate all the conclusions drawn from the previous 18 hours. A steadfast believer in the notion of \u2018too much of a good thing\u2019, I quickly changed the subject and asked him where he thought we should go on vacation this fall.\n\nHis answer, without missing a beat: the Mayan Riviera. For all the reasons I\u2019ve already described. It\u2019s familiar, easy, comfortable, you know what you\u2019re going to get. And I agreed. With all the uncertainties that normal life likes to throw at you, having a port in the storm like that is very reassuring\u2014in the most depressing way possible.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:28.064+0000"}

{"entityId": 1603, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Birth-control pioneer Margaret Sanger embraced some truly horrific ideas. But she also did quite a lot of good.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz has become the first GOP presidential candidate to formally sign on to the efforts by a group of black pastors to get a bust of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger removed from an exhibit at the Smithsonian\u2019s National Portrait Gallery. The participants, who held a press conference Thursday, claim that Sanger\u2019s appearance in the exhibit, called, \u201cStruggle for Justice,\u201d is offensive, because it places the reproductive rights trailblazer in a position of honor alongside such icons as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Rosa Parks.\n\nThanks to the recent release of a series of controversial videos, Sanger\u2019s link to Planned Parenthood would have likely been enough to elicit criticism of her inclusion in the exhibit. But Sanger also espoused some views about race and class that were, at times, deplorable.\n\nSo are Cruz and his fellow conservatives correct? Should black Americans find Sanger\u2019s legacy, and the celebration of her legacy by the National Portrait Gallery and Planned Parenthood, offensive?\n\nThere is no question that Margaret Sanger, born in 1879, held some views that any reasonable person today would consider unconscionable. She viewed eugenics as sound policy and considered the Ku Klux Klan an appropriate ideological partner to advance her work as a family planning advocate. For these reasons, she\u2019s not someone I would call a great person, particularly speaking as an African-American woman who is not from a wealthy background, meaning Sanger likely would have deemed me \u201cunfit\u201d to reproduce.\n\nBut that does not change the fact that all reasonable people should also be able to agree that America would be far worse off had Margaret Sanger never existed. The fact is before Sanger\u2019s arrest in 1916 and subsequent jail sentence for aiding women in acquiring birth control, which resulted in a landmark legal ruling, most American woman did not have access to reliable forms of family planning.\n\nBesides the many health advantages American families experienced due to greater access to contraception thanks to the Sanger case, there have also been countless cultural benefits to society.\n\nThis means that most American women lacked the ability to plan the number of children they would have. As a result, families were larger, poorer, and women were more likely to die earlier. Infant mortality rates were also high. This shouldn\u2019t be particularly surprising. A woman lacking access to quality health care and nutrition is less likely to give birth to a healthy baby, or to be able to provide access to necessary nutrition or health care to a baby that was originally born healthy.\n\nBesides the many health advantages American families experienced due to greater access to contraception thanks to the Sanger case, there have also been countless cultural benefits to society. As families have shrunk women\u2019s participation in society has increased, as has the emergence of more women in positions of power. There are more women in colleges, corporate boardrooms and Congress. This shouldn\u2019t come as a shock. After all, if a woman has eight children, the norm for 1800s America, she might have second thoughts about committing to the grueling schedule required to be a political candidate, particularly one who has to commute between Washington, D.C., and another state on a regular basis.\n\nSo with the exception of GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum, who is opposed to birth control and has a large family, it is highly likely that Republican candidates, including Senator Ted Cruz, owe a debt of gratitude to Margaret Sanger, whether they want to admit it or not. (Cruz, it should be noted, has two children, and his wife, Heidi, is a high-powered investment banker.)\n\nFor Cruz and other Sanger critics, her sins outweigh her contributions. But my question is: Who gets to decide that? While Sanger\u2019s inclusion in the \u201cStruggle for Justice\u201d exhibit has drawn protests, Henry Clay\u2019s inclusion in the \u201cA Conversation About America\u201d exhibit at the same institution has not.\n\nClay, like many of the men that shaped our nation, including George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, owned slaves. Which means if we removed the statues and portraits of every leader who contributed to this country in a meaningful way for gross moral failings, then the walls of the White House, the Capitol and most State Houses would be empty.\n\nAs a black American, I can say that while I am troubled by some of Margaret Sanger\u2019s words, I would be remiss not to acknowledge her contributions to my community. Though some conservative critics seem to hold Sanger accountable for the high abortion rates within the black community since she founded the precursor to Planned Parenthood, Sanger\u2019s own attitudes about abortion were complex, and not what we might call \u201cpro-choice\u201d today.\n\nIn 1918 she wrote, \u201cWhile there are cases where even the law recognizes an abortion as justifiable if recommended by a physician, I assert that the hundreds of thousands of abortions performed in America each year are a disgrace to civilization.\u201d Instead, she argued that government\u2019s failure to not make contraception widely accessible to all women made the government culpable in any deaths resulting from abortion.\n\nSanger also railed against what she saw as the class inequality and hypocrisy evident in the multitude of family-planning options available to well-to-do white women versus what was available to the poor, many of them immigrants or black. Both of my grandmothers, born in the 1910s, were from large families. One of them was one of 14 children, the other was one of eight. They struggled in poverty as children, something they both talked about. When they decided to have families of their own, they were able to plan a size that worked for them, an option that had not been available to their mothers.\n\nAs a result, my parents became the first in their families to graduate from college, and I grew up a member of America\u2019s middle class. This would not have been possible without Margaret Sanger\u2019s contributions, which benefited millions of Americans from all walks of life. So if she doesn\u2019t belong in American exhibit titled \u201cStruggle for Justice,\u201d then who does?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:28.607+0000"}

It would be ironic, considering the men his brother turned to for foreign policy advice. It would also be highly problematic\u2014since foreign policy establishment hawks should represent one of Bush\u2019s few natural constituencies on the right. But it\u2019s hard to observe recent developments and not suspect something is afoot.\n\nI\u2019ve often observed that Sen. Rand Paul has to walk a fine line in order to keep all the disparate elements of his coalition together, but it\u2019s increasingly looking like Jeb Bush is having to do the same thing. He has the legacies of his father and brother to contend with. And while these legacies aren\u2019t necessarily mutually exclusive, they aren\u2019t necessarily complementary, either. And therein lies the trap for Jeb: Does he alienate the GOP\u2019s main cadre of foreign policy activists and thinkers, or does he saddle up with them and risk being seen as the second coming of his brother?\n\nThe foreign policy \u201crealist\u201d community hopes Jeb will be the \u201csmart\u201d son and follow the \u201cprudent\u201d footsteps of his father. Bush 41 oversaw the collapse of the Soviet Union and liberated Kuwait without toppling Saddam, a move that\u2014depending on where you stand\u2014was either an example of prudence or cowardice. But neoconservatives prefer George W. Bush\u2019s more aggressive foreign policy, and want the GOP to nominate a hawk in 2016. Now Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign needs to figure out what kind of President Bush he would be, and he likely won\u2019t be able to assuage the concerns of both camps.\n\nThe conundrum, presumably, began when Jeb announced his foreign policy team. Much was made of the fact that many of his advisers had served in previous Bush administrations. This was much ado about nothing. Any Republican who gained senior foreign policy experience in the last quarter of a century would likely have worked for a Bush administration.\n\n\n\nThe comparatively moderate, intellectually inclined Jeb Bush would seem like a natural candidate for neoconservatives to rally behind.\n\nMore interesting was the amount of daylight between the foreign policy advisers who served his father and his brother\u2014a cleavage that is especially noteworthy in the context of the larger discussion taking place right now, regarding Iran and Israel. There\u2019s a lot of range between the neoconservative Paul Wolfowitz and an old-school GOP realist like James Baker, yet both are on the list of Jeb advisers.\n\nSpeaking of Baker, the Washington Free Beacon, which is widely thought of as a neoconservative outlet, recently noted: \u201cJeb Bush\u2019s selection of Baker as a foreign policy adviser has sparked concern among conservatives and in the Jewish and pro-Israel communities. Baker is infamous for his hostility to Israel, having said during his tenure as secretary of state in the George H.W. Bush administration, \u2018F--k the Jews, they don\u2019t vote for us anyway.\u2019 Baker is also a supporter of President Obama\u2019s Iran negotiations.\u201d\n\nAs the Free Beacon expected, Baker\u2014who served as Secretary of State during George H.W. Bush\u2019s administration\u2014did not go easy on Israel when he addressed the liberal J Street conference. And this has led to some think that Jeb Bush might seek to follow his father\u2019s foreign policy\u2014not his brother\u2019s.\n\nIn a world where Republicans are trying to out-hawk one another, this might sound absurd. But presidents have been known to govern differently from the way they campaign\u2014remember in 2000 when Bush ran as the anti-\u201cnation building\u201d candidate? \u201cThe older Bush circle seems confident that Jeb sided with his father and Brent Scowcroft on the folly of letting the neocons push America into diverting from Osama to Saddam,\u201d wrote Maureen Dowd. (It should be noted that Scowcroft penned a 2002 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled \u201cDon\u2019t Attack Saddam,\u201d which was eerily prescient in many regards.)\n\nSome are clearly worried that Dowd is right\u2014that Jeb is a chip off the old block. \u201cWhether Jeb disavows James Baker, & how quickly & strongly, could be an oddly important early moment in GOP race,\u201d Bill Kristol tweeted (linking to a Politico story about Baker blasting Bibi). This isn\u2019t an anomaly. The Washington Post\u2019s Jennifer Rubin writes that a source at a Jewish organization told her: \u201cJim Baker\u2019s bitterly critical comments of Israel and Netanyahu conjured up the worst memories of the H. W. Bush administration\u2019s confrontation with the Jewish state. Any 2016 campaign that takes advice and counsel from him will raise serious questions and concerns from the pro-Israel community.\u201d\n\nThe comparatively moderate, intellectually inclined Jeb Bush would seem like a natural candidate for neoconservatives to rally behind. But Baker speaking at J Street while working for the campaign in some capacity is cause for concern. This is dangerous if prominent hawks start to suspect that Jeb might not be as friendly to their cause as the Ted Cruzes of the world. Kristol and Rubin would seem to be sending a message to Bush that he can\u2019t take their support for granted. They need him to prove that he\u2019s a lot more like Dubya than his dad. Given Jeb\u2019s vulnerabilities with so much of the rest of the conservative coalition, they\u2019re in a good position to make demands. And he\u2019s not in a good position to deny them.\n\nPolitico is already reporting that Jeb Bush is distancing himself from Baker, noting that he \u201cdisagrees\u201d with him on Israel. And writing at National Review Wednesday morning, Jeb made his pro-Israel position clear. Let\u2019s see if that\u2019s enough for the critics. If Jeb really wants to win the nomination, he might have to drop Jim Baker like a bad habit.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:29.170+0000"}

The move came following multiple unsuccessful Freedom of Information Act requests.\n\nWith \u201cEmail-gate\u201d making big headlines, it was easy to miss that another organization is suing the State Department to force the release of another former Secretary of State\u2019s communications.\n\nLast week, the National Security Archive (a research institute based out of the George Washington University) filed a lawsuit seeking release of the last 700 transcripts Henry Kissinger\u2019s phone calls. Kissinger left State in 1977 at the end of the Ford administration.\n\n\u201cThis was a total coincidence,\u201d William Burr, a senior analyst at the Archive, told The Daily Beast about the timing of the two lawsuits. The Archive is suing over what it describes as the \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d over releasing the documents.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a long legal history of this,\u201d dating back to 2001, Burr explained. In 2007, the State Department withheld the 700 transcripts, claiming executive privilege.\n\n\u201cWhy is there such a long delay for 700 documents?\u201d Burr said. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of hard to fathom. But what I\u2019ve heard from sources is that the documents are stuck at the White House.\u201d\n\nThe transcripts, which likely include Kissinger\u2019s conversations with President Gerald Ford, could shed some new light on the controversial statesman\u2019s role in arms control issues, U.S. relations with China, the Cyprus crisis, the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, and the Angola crisis.\n\nThe Archive is prepared to keep having their patience tried. \u201cIt\u2019ll be up to the judge, and what happens happens,\u201d Burr said. \u201cTime will tell.\u201d\n\nFor his critics, any revelations in these documents aren\u2019t likely to change their opinions. Kissinger already has a lengthy rap sheet. Many have long highlighted his alleged complicity in major human rights violations, genocide, and war crimes during his time as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor.\n\n\u201cWhy is there such a long delay for 700 documents? It\u2019s sort of hard to fathom.\u201d\u2014William Burr\n\nHe greenlit campaigns of mass murder in East Timor, Bangladesh, and Argentina. He was a party to murder and subversion of democracy in Chile. He was a key player in savaging Cyprus.\n\nAnd perhaps his most notorious (alleged, shall we?) act was his role in sabotaging (on behalf of the Nixon presidential campaign) the 1968 Vietnam War peace talks\u2014secret diplomacy that possibly violated the Logan Act. The Vietnam War was thus prolonged well into the Nixon era, allowing Kissinger ample time to oversee appalling campaigns in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize winner was, of course, still able to cement a reputation as a master statesman and a pop-culture fascination. Here he is participating in a celeb-filled dance video with Stephen Colbert:\n\n(Colbert\u2019s coziness with Kissinger is bizarre when you consider that the future Late Show host has publicly blasted \u201cthe war crimes of Nixon.\u201d)\n\nKissinger\u2019s brand of diplomacy and charm also won him a fan in none other than Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cI relied on his counsel when I served as secretary of state,\u201d Clinton wrote, in reviewing a book by her \u201cfriend\u201d and fellow secretary. \u201cHe checked in with me regularly, sharing astute observations about foreign leaders and sending me written reports on his travels.\u201d She was wise enough to clarify that she and Kissinger \u201chave often seen the world and some of our challenges quite differently, and advocated different responses now and in the past.\u201d\n\nGood to know.\n\nIn the meantime, you can read the Archive\u2019s complaint below:", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:29.839+0000"}

It was to be either an omen of the betrayal his Tea Party supporters would later feel, or a foreshadowing of the powerful potential this young Cuban American had for higher office.\n\nIt had taken a month for his hometown newspaper, the Miami Herald, to notice that the 38-year-old Miami lawyer, once a leader in the state House, had formally joined the race. He didn\u2019t even hold a launch event when he registered as a candidate for U.S. Senate in early 2009.\n\n\u201cIt was lonely out there. He was living off the land,\u201d an early supporter said. \u201cIf he had held a launch event for his U.S. Senate campaign, you could have held it in a phone booth.\u201d\n\nIt was the excitement of the Florida Tea Party movement, which exploded into the public consciousness in the spring and summer of 2009, that ultimately transformed Rubio into a serious contender.\n\n\u201cAcross the board in 2010, the Tea Party played a huge role. They got people out to vote, they were active, they were knocking on doors, making phone calls. There were little spots during the campaign where you just felt the momentum,\u201d said Anthony Bustamante, Rubio\u2019s former statewide field director and one of the first half-dozen staffers to join the Senate campaign.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m through with him. He will never get my vote. \u2018Disappointed\u2019 would mean that he has an opportunity to restore his credibility, and there is no opportunity for that.\u201d\n\nBut don\u2019t count on many of those original Florida Tea Party supporters to be in the crowd Monday evening when Rubio is expected launch his bid for the White House with dramatic fanfare at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, converted in the 1990s as a monument to Cuban refugees.\n\nSix years after the movement\u2019s initial rallies, marches, and demonstrations, Tea Party activists feel let down and betrayed by their native son.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m through with him. He will never get my vote. \u2018Disappointed\u2019 would mean that he has an opportunity to restore his credibility, and there is no opportunity for that,\u201d said KrisAnne Hall, an attorney and Tea Party activist from north-central Florida. \u201cThe overwhelming perception is that Marco Rubio is not a Tea Party candidate.\u201d\n\nSome Florida Tea Party supporters still wax nostalgic about the early, hopeful days of the Rubio Senate campaign.\n\n\u201cWhen he was first running for Senate, I was a big fan\u2026He walked the neighborhood both inside and outside his district, knocked on doors and asked what people\u2019s needs were, what their issues were. I was so impressed with that,\u201d said Lisa Becker, who helped run A Sisterhood of Mommy Patriots, a Tea Party group geared toward mothers.\n\n\u201cThen,\u201d Becker continued, \u201che got into office.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce he got into Washington, he had his sights set early on higher office,\u201d said Jason Hoyt, a Tea Party organizer from central Florida. \u201cHe surrounded himself with people who were going to help him navigate Washington to get there, and in that process he disconnected from his base.\u201d\n\nBecker still acknowledges Rubio\u2019s charisma and oratorical abilities. But now she thinks she might have been played.\n\n\u201cNow I wonder if he was ever listening or it was just a ploy to get votes\u2026He says all the right things to the audience he needs, and we in Florida are no longer his audience. His new audience is national voters who might elect him president,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe were hungry for leadership on our principles and values, but it didn\u2019t come from Marco,\u201d Hoyt added. \u201cI thought it would.\u201d\n\nMany Tea Partiers point to Rubio\u2019s work in the Senate as part of the so-called Gang of Eight, who tried to come to a bipartisan consensus on comprehensive immigration reform. It ultimately failed, but many on the right will not forgive what they disdain as the senator\u2019s support for \u201camnesty.\u201d\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference this year, Rubio tried to distance himself from his work on immigration, saying he had learned his lesson\u2014that broad-based reform was only possible after complete border security.\n\nSome libertarian-leaning Tea Party activists also point to foreign policy and national security as issues on which he let them down. Hall, the attorney from north-central Florida, listed off the offenses: Rubio\u2019s support for indefinite detention, support for arming the Syrian rebels, support for the war against ISIS without explicit congressional approval, and support for the NSA.\n\n\u201cIf he had been listening when he was knocking on those doors, he would have found out what matters. Being in perpetual war matters to families,\u201d Becker said.\n\nBustamante, Rubio\u2019s former statewide field director, plays down any discontentment Florida Tea Party activists feel about the Florida Republican senator.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a rift. The Tea Party embraced Marco. I think they still hold them up as one of their own,\u201d he said.\n\nTom Gaitens, who knew Rubio in the state House and formerly worked for the conservative group FreedomWorks, said he had forgiven Rubio for the sin of working with Democrats on comprehensive immigration reform.\n\n\u201cThe only perfect guy I ever met was Jesus Christ, in my heart. What I care about is that they stand up and show courage, and I think Marco has done that every step of the way,\u201d Gaitens said.\n\nAnd Rubio is still an insurgent. He is far from the front-runner in the large Republican presidential field.\n\nIt\u2019s a position where he has thrived: Bustamante recalled the early \u201cstartup\u201d days of the Rubio Senate campaign, where they drove 10 hours round trip to Jacksonville just to make $900.\n\nRubio is not running a startup anymore. He\u2019s running a full-fledged business that hopes to raise millions to elevate him to the White House.\n\nThis time, though, he\u2019ll do it without the support of many of the grassroots activists who propelled him to the Senate hoping for a Tea Party champion.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:30.458+0000"}

It\u2019s obvious what it should be called.\n\nBut first, let\u2019s review, starting with Messrs. Jackson and Jefferson. Okay, Andrew Jackson, that\u2019s an easy one. Genocide, Indian Removal Act, Trail of Tears, an ardor for slavery that was formidable even by the standards of the day. Nasty piece of work. True, he was a president, and he did beat the Brits in New Orleans, so sure, give him some kind of statue somewhere. But take him off the double sawbuck, and for God\u2019s sakes get his name off the annual dinner of the party that gets the lion\u2019s share of non-white people\u2019s votes.\n\nAs for Jefferson, I think that one is a lot more complicated. Yes, he was a slave owner. No one\u2019s defending that. But he was a genius and a Renaissance Man and the philosophical author of many of our best traditions, separation of church and state for starters. Also the rather crucial idea that there must be no test for citizenship save fealty to the Constitution. I would say that there\u2019s a lot more in the plus column than in the minus. But I understand that that particular minus looms large, as it should. There are many other ways to honor the upsides, so I guess if he has to go, he has to go.\n\nAll right then. So now we\u2019ve gone from the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, referred to euphoniously by the initiated as the J-J Dinner, to the _____-______ Dinner. Everybody seems intent in dumping the two old namesakes, but I don\u2019t see many people reaching much consensus on a new name. In Connecticut, they dumped the two J\u2019s but put off agreeing on a new name until this fall. Georgia Democrats appear to have done the same.\n\nWhat\u2019s so hard about this? The pool of potential options is ridiculously finite. I mean, it kind of has to be a president. So let\u2019s have a look at them, starting with the earliest post Jefferson-Jackson Democratic chief executives.\n\n1. Martin Van Buren. Right. That would be like the Yankees naming their annual dinner after Joe Pepitone.\n\n2. James K. Polk. It turns out that Polk gets pretty solid ratings from historians, often finishing in the Top 10. But he is fatally flawed according to the standards by which we\u2019re judging Jefferson and Jackson: He opposed the Wilmot Proviso, which sought to ban slavery in any of the territories \u201cacquired\u201d from Mexico\n\n3. Franklin Pierce. Disaster. The whole Kansas situation. However, I do read here that he lived to watch all three of his children die, including the third one\u2019s near-decapitation in a railway accident while Pierce was president-elect. Youch. That\u2019s hideous stuff, but it doesn\u2019t get you a dinner named after you.\n\n4. James Buchanan. Worse than Pierce, without the family tragedy (but an odd personal life, at once austere and rococo). No chance.\n\nIf Democrats insist on naming their dinner after someone who never did anything unsavory, they\u2019re going to have to go for Gandhi or Jesus.\n\n5. Andrew Johnson. Unfairly impeached, but nothing to write home about. And yet another Tennessean. What was up with that?\n\n6. Grover Cleveland. Hmmm, okay. He was for his day a rather courageous anti-imperialist, one of the few early presidents who didn\u2019t thirst to kill loads of high-melanin people. Very good on the Hawaii question. So that\u2019s something. More of a mixed bag domestically. Not bad as U.S. presidents go, but not dinner-worthy.\n\n7. Woodrow Wilson. Are you kidding? The presidency\u2019s biggest mega-racist. He makes Jefferson look like Joe Rauh. Next.\n\n8. Franklin Roosevelt. Ah. Now you\u2019re talking.\n\nOkay, I have an idea at this point. Now that we\u2019re into familiar territory, let\u2019s drop the chronology and the quick dismissals, because everyone from here on out has to be treated with some degree of seriousness. So let\u2019s sort through them.\n\nWe start with Jimmy Carter. Well, we wish him all the best in his fight with cancer. And we applaud so much of what he has done in more recent years. Do you know for example that the Carter Center is almost singlehandedly responsible for worldwide near-eradication of Guinea Worm Disease, an extremely painful condition that afflicted the world\u2019s poorest people? For that alone, Carter ought to be honored by 100,000 dinners.\n\nBut not, alas, the Democratic Party\u2019s annual dinner. The obvious reasons: One term, inflation, the hostage crisis. I bet you don\u2019t know that Carter was a world-class job creator, seriously. But it just wouldn\u2019t pass the laugh test, alas. History will be kind to him in a number of ways, but you can\u2019t call his a smashing presidency by any means.\n\nLBJ. Sigh. Such greatness domestically. But Vietnam. I believe that I have noticed this trend. Fifteen or so years ago, if you asked your average liberal to put a \u201cdomestic achievements\u201d weight on one side of the LBJ scale and a \u201cVietnam\u201d weight on the other side, s/he would have gone about 30-70. I sense that now this liberal would go maybe 45-55. So he\u2019s getting there, but he\u2019s not ready for dinner time.\n\nJack. Jack\u2019s reputation has gone down, hasn\u2019t it? The women, the pills (albeit for a really painful back). Where Johnson has gone up in the historical revisionism sweepstakes, Kennedy has taken a bit of a tumble. Still, the Camelot thing retains a certain talismanic power for Democrats. So, JFK is a contender.\n\nHarry Truman. There\u2019s a lot to like here. No one should have many issues with his domestic agenda, which was robustly populist. And I\u2019m a fan of his foreign policy and wrote about a jillion columns over the last decade explaining why the neocons had misappropriated him. He never would have done something like invade Iraq. Okay, there\u2019s Fat Man and Little Boy to think about, but I would say that he was looking at maybe another full year of war and deaths of how many American soldiers before Japan finally surrendered. Just about anyone sitting in the Oval Office would have dropped them.\n\nAnyway, we can\u2019t go combing through the details of these people\u2019s records looking for excuses to exclude them. That\u2019s just historically unfair. Basically, Truman represents decent Democratic and American values. I also like the fact, and maybe this is just me, that he came from humble roots and was such a voracious autodidact.\n\nThe Bill Clinton case is muddied not by Monica or any of that nonsense but by the fact that it\u2019s too early, especially given the possibility that his wife might be president for the next four or eight years. That would just be tacky, a President Clinton presiding over Clinton Day dinners. Actually something worse than tacky. But he was a fine president in many of the most important ways, and maybe someday it\u2019ll make sense, especially if Hillary also becomes POTUS.\n\nIf it\u2019s too early for Clinton, it\u2019s definitely too early for Barack Obama. Although\u2026the idea of the Truman-Obama Dinner does have something going for it. That would take some stones. It\u2019d make Republicans crazy. And it would connect older Democratic traditions (the days when the Democrats were unequivocally the party of \u201cthe working man\u201d) with the newer ones. It isn\u2019t nuts.\n\nBut ultimately, and I guess predictably, I vote for the FDR Dinner. First of all, you don\u2019t need two people. The Republicans have a Lincoln Day Dinner. One person is fine. And come on\u2014he\u2019s Franklin Roosevelt. Depression. Fascism. I mean, look at this. In survey after survey after survey, the top three presidents are Washington, Lincoln, and Frank. This is just as no-brainer as a no-brainer gets. Yes, he played ball with the Dixiecrats, and yes, there was the Japanese internment. But if Democrats insist on naming their dinner after someone who never did anything unsavory, they\u2019re going to have to go for Gandhi or Jesus.\n\nThis should need all of five minutes\u2019 debate at state Democratic committees. But watch, this\u2019ll drag out three years in some places. What I bet a lot of them will do is leave it up to each state to choose some local hero. In my home state, I doubt they\u2019d be able to avoid calling it the Robert Byrd Dinner.

But he connects with the heart of the Republican Party.\n\nThe GOP sowed the wind, and Donald Trump is reaping the whirlwind. Much to the horror of the Republican Establishment, Trump has a message that connects with the party\u2019s base, and makes no bones about it. With his in-your-face style, Trump is simply saying what the Republican rank-and-file think. Period, full stop.\n\nObama\u2019s wasn\u2019t born here, check. And, of course, a hard line on immigration.\n\n\u201cI love the Mexican people \u2026 I respect Mexico \u2026 but the problem we have is that their leaders are much sharper, smarter and more cunning than our leaders, and they\u2019re killing us at the border,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re taking our manufacturing jobs. They\u2019re taking our money. They\u2019re killing us.\u201d\n\nTrump was also late in calling for South Carolina to shelve the Confederate Flag, which is no surprise. A whopping 78 percent of Republicans still view the flag as a legitimate form of Southern pride, and two-thirds say it\u2019s OK for states to fly it.\n\nLike him or not, The Donald is one of the few Republicans to internalize the facts that the white working- and middle class are the heart of the Republican Party, and that older Americans now trend Republican. He connects, unlike Mitt Romney, who in 2012 craved the votes of white non-college graduates, but could not break through.\n\nBut Trump is not Mitt. On Saturday, at the Phoenix Convention Center, Trump drew a crowd of 4,000 to hear him denounce illegal immigration in raw terms, with lines forming before sunrise.\n\nAccording to Trump, \u201cThe word is getting out that we have to stop illegal immigration. \u2026We have a situation that is absolutely out of control. \u2026 We\u2019re getting taken apart piece-by-piece slowly.\u201d\n\nFor good measure, Trump even invoked the ghost of Richard Nixon by announcing as he left the stage, \u201cThe silent majority is back, and we\u2019re going to take our country back.\u201d\n\nAhead of the event Trump was described by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake as \u201ccoarse, ill-informed and inaccurate,\u201d and by McCain as \u201coffensive.\u201d\n\nTrump also introduced Jamiel Shaw to the audience, whose son was shot and killed by an illegal immigrant. Shaw painted a grim and vivid picture: \u201cThink about your child laying in the street dead. \u2026 We were not designed for that.\u201d Harsh words for sure, but less clumsy than a mid-debate plea for \u201cself-deportation.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re taking our jobs. They\u2019re taking our manufacturing jobs. They\u2019re taking our money. They\u2019re killing us.\u201d\n\nThe P.T. Barnum of this election cycle, Trump understands that politics is transactional, and that the electorate must be offered something in return for their votes. By contrast, almost everyone else in the Republican field seems fixated on the donor base, broadening the GOP at the expense of its core, or talking about faith, even as they would pickpocket the voters of what is theirs.\n\nUnlike Trump, the rest of the presidential hopefuls parade around with outstretched arms and upturned palms, echoing their patrons\u2019 sentiments. Bush, Cruz, Rubio, Christie, and Walker have each called for seniors to take a hit for the greater good of America\u2019s bondholders, but hey, at least they love God, and will let you know.\n\nWith apologies to the Good Book, man can\u2019t live on faith alone, and Trump understands at least that much. Rather, he\u2019s taking the \u201cyou paid for it, it\u2019s yours\u201d approach to older Americans.\n\nSpeaking to CPAC back in 2013 Trump declared, \u201cIt\u2019s not unreasonable for people who paid into a system for decades to expect to get their money\u2019s worth\u2014that\u2019s not an \u2018entitlement,\u2019 that\u2019s honoring a deal.\u201d Trump sounds like someone in touch with reality, or at least like someone who wants to win.\n\nIn the face of this Trumpmentum, the party\u2019s establishment is powerless\u2014unable to admit that Trump is in sync with GOP voters, so they say simply that Trump is \u201cbad.\u201d They risk coming off as tone-deaf or, worse, mean.\n\nFor example, over at The New York Times, Peter Wehner, a Bush 43 White House alum, took Trump to task for sticking up for the elderly. According to Wehner, Trump committed the unpardonable sin of accusing Republican contenders of \u201c\u2018attacking\u2019 Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.\u201d\n\nThis nod toward the social safety net (and political realism) led Wehner to ask, somewhat peevishly, \u201cWhy would conservatives find him the least bit appealing?\u201d\n\nFor starters, it might have to do with Republicans being older. That\u2019s a fact, plain and simple. In the last presidential election, Republicans won among voters 45 and up. Seniors haven\u2019t voted Democratic since 1992. And while Wehner may have forgotten that George W. Bush\u2019s call for Social Security privatization preceded the 2008 stock market crash and Great Recession, older voters haven\u2019t.\n\nNo, Trump\u2019s rants will not help the Republicans come November 2016. But Trump\u2019s stance is doing wonders for him in the here and now. According the latest Economist/Yougov Poll, Trump leads the GOP pack, and for the first time is viewed favorably by a plurality of the party faithful.\n\nAnd no, Trump almost certainly won\u2019t win the nomination, but Republicans are rightfully concerned that today\u2019s rhetoric will haunt them a year from now. America\u2019s changing demographics further weigh against them, so simply beating up on Trump will leave the challenges posed by his candidacy unanswered. Resistance to immigration is not just about culture or ethnicity (although they are certainly factors), it\u2019s also about economics, something Trump with his bar-stool political rhetoric understands.\n\nProspective Republican nominees must be able to say how they will re-ignite 3 percent-plus growth, while spurring wages upward. (For the record, since 2006 annual GDP growth has been below 3 percent. The 4 percent growth promised by Jeb was last seen in 2000, the final year of Bill Clinton\u2019s presidency.)\n\nMeanwhile, employee compensation as a percentage of GDP remains near an all-time low. Working-class Americans understand this in their gut and feel it in their wallet, so they can\u2019t be blamed for thinking that liberalized immigration helps no one but illegal immigrants, their families, and employers across the board. Those are not only Trump\u2019s people; they\u2019re the Republican base.\n\nSo while Trump\u2019s take is tart, he has a hit a nerve in this prolonged era of economic insecurity and froth. Labeling Trump a villain, or calling on Americans to labor for longer hours misses the mark. Rather, getting out from Trump\u2019s shadow will require the Republican nominee to make America\u2019s workers an offer they won\u2019t want to refuse. As Trump would say, it\u2019s all part of \u201cthe art of the deal.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:31.255+0000"}
{"entityId": 1609, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Elizabeth Warren is leading a liberal revolt against a trade deal she insists will hurt workers and unravel Wall Street reforms. But can President Obama muscle it through anyway?\n\nThe rhetoric is heating up between Democrats as the Senate prepares to vote on giving President Obama \u201cfast-track\u201d authority to negotiate a sweeping trade deal that a wide swath of his party and labor base oppose.\n\nDemocrats led by Senator Elizabeth Warren are denouncing the emerging deal and the secrecy surrounding the negotiations. Warren upped the ante last week when she claimed a little-noticed provision in the emerging trade deal, the investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS), could be used by corporations to undo Dodd-Frank, the financial regulatory legislation that is one of Obama\u2019s major achievements.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, says Warren\u2019s criticism is baseless. \u201cThink about the logic of that, right?\u201d Obama asked his audience at Nike headquarters near Beaverton, Oregon on Friday. \u201cThe notion that I had this massive fight with Wall Street to make sure that we don\u2019t repeat what happened in 2007, 2008, and then I sign a provision that would unravel it?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d have to be pretty stupid.\u201d\n\nObama continued his war on Warren through the weekend, reminding Democrats that she doesn\u2019t walk on water, that she\u2019s a politician. Warren, he insists, is fighting an old fight going back to NAFTA, a free trade agreement signed by President Clinton in 1994.\n\n\u201cHe should have done this long ago,\u201d says Jim Kessler, a founder of Third Way, a centrist Democratic group that is pro-trade. \u201cHe\u2019s allowed Democrats to take a two-by-four to his signature economic achievement of his second term, which is to expand exports in the biggest market of the world, Asia. He needed to treat these attacks on it as though Ted Cruz were making them. Instead, he made it feel like if you\u2019re a Democrat you can say anything and he\u2019s not going to care.\u201d\n\nWarren evidently crossed some line in Obamaland when she suggested the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) deal would give corporations free rein. The investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) is a standard feature in all trade deals, but it can be made to sound pretty scary.\n\nKeeping a tight lid on these trade negotiations is essential to getting a deal in a fractious political climate, but it has also fueled suspicion among Democratsabout what corporations may be getting at the expense of workers.\n\nISDS allows companies to sue host countries in special ad hoc tribunes. Phillip Morris is currently using ISDS to challenge regulations in foreign countries on packaging cigarettes with prominent health warnings that might discourage sales. Corporations have won in other countries, but never in the United States. \u201cThe ISDS argument borders on silly,\u201d says Kessler. \u201cWe\u2019ve never lost a case and nothing will happen to Dodd-Frank.\u201d Warren\u2019s argument is \u201cas off-base as death panels,\u201d he says, a comparison that Obama also makes.\n\nWarren punched back in an interview with NPR airing Tuesday pointing out that American courts would not be the deciders, that \u201cprivate corporate lawyers who get paid by big corporations to sit and decide\u201d would be the arbiters. \u201cAnd let\u2019s be clear, once those private corporate lawyers make a decision, there is no appeal.\u201d\n\nWarren\u2019s ability to elevate an issue is unparalleled in today\u2019s Democratic Party, and rank-and-file Democrats already don\u2019t like trade deals. They cost jobs, liberals argue, and most Democrats will vote against whatever treaty emerges. If Obama succeeds in getting fast-track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) from the Congress, lawmakers would then give up their right to amend the agreement and would vote up or down on the final deal.\n\nThe Senate vote could come as early as Tuesday. Seven Democrats supported trade legislation in committee and another seven or eight are either there or gettable. Republicans broadly support the deal, however, and even if a few defect the legislation would still get the 60 votes needed to pass.\n\nThe House is tougher. Speaker Boehner and most Republicans are free traders and want to get this deal done. But Boehner needs thirty Democrats to join the GOP to reach 218, and they\u2019re not there yet.\n\nKeeping a tight lid on these trade negotiations is essential to getting a deal in a fractious political climate, but it has also fueled suspicion among Democrats about what corporations may be getting at the expense of workers. The evolving treaty is heavy reading, and only a small number of lawmakers other than the earnest Warren, who lives and breathes these issues, have done their homework. The material is classified; members can\u2019t take notes, and staffers with security clearances can have access but must be accompanied by a member of Congress.\n\nThis is standard procedure in trade deals, but in Warren\u2019s hands the secrecy has taken on a life of its own as more evidence of a system rigged against workers. Democrats from industrial states don\u2019t complain so much about secrecy or the ISPS provision; they just point to the history of trade deals and the hundreds of thousands of American workers who have been displaced when companies out-source their factories. Nike has a million workers abroad, a third of them in Vietnam, and promises that if the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is passed, they would create 10,000 new jobs, with an additional 40,000 in its supply chain.\n\nThis does not impress Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, a Democrat, who told the Daily Beast that after so many false and broken promises on trade, \u201cThere\u2019s a basic difference of opinion in how this turns out in the end.\u201d He cites the trade deal with South Korea that passed Congress during Obama\u2019s first term. He argues that, while South Korea has gained $12 billion in trade from the deal, the U.S. has only gained $1 billion.\n\nThird Way makes the counter argument that of 17 trade deals completed since NAFTA, 13 have benefited the United States. And unlike NAFTA, the TPP includes within the treaty supposedly enforceable standards on labor and the environment. Either way, this is a tough fight for the White House. Win or lose, there will be bruised feelings among people Obama called his \u201cfellow travelers.\u201d\n\nBut hey, this is politics. \u201cDemocrats are pretty good at fighting, and we\u2019re not bad at making up either,\u201d says Casey. \u201cThis is a good fight to have.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:31.510+0000"}

Top defense and intelligence officials also said they\u2019re looking into the accusations.\n\nThe Senate Armed Services Committee\u2019s chairman, Republican Sen.

The Intelligence Committee will take all appropriate action to ensure our nation\u2019s policymakers receive unbiased analysis from the Intelligence Community,\u201d said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes in a statement.\n\nAdded his Democratic counterpart, ranking member Rep. Adam Schiff, \u201cwe do take seriously any allegations of the mishandling or manipulation of intelligence information for purposes other than getting to ground truth. In the wake of the flawed intelligence prior to the Iraq War, we must make sure that all voices are appropriately considered and that assessments are never again politicized.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s deeply troubling and it needs to be investigated,\u201d Republican Sen.

It\u2019s spreading, it\u2019s mutating.

If that\u2019s the case, we ought to be doing an authorization.\u201d\n\nReports on allegations of cooked intelligence and sanitized reports had reverberations elsewhere throughout Washington on Thursday. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter reminded military leaders that they should give their candid assessment of the U.S. war effort.\n\nPentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook told reporters that Carter ordered Marcel Lettre, the acting Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, to remind top defense intelligence officials they should provide their \u201cunvarnished, transparent intelligence\u201d because that \u201cis what the secretary expects on a daily basis.\u201d\n\nAnd Gen.

But the man behind that campaign, who rose from relative obscurity to run an operation that is easily crushing its rivals in the polls, is himself a product of an old-boys network of Republican insiders that imploded when lobbyist Jack Abramoff testified against his friends in Congress.\n\nCorey Lewandowski, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, launched his career in Washington politics as an aide to Representative Bob Ney, best known for his involvement with Abramoff.

During the rant, Cohen claimed that marital rape was legal\u2014it is not\u2014and bragged about destroying the life of a young beauty queen.\n\nLewandowski\u2019s full-throated support for Ney may cause some headaches for Trump, who often implies that his personal wealth makes him incorruptible.\n\nIn exchange for various gifts, including campaign contributions, Ney, then the chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, did favors for Abramoff\u2019s clients, such as inserting amendments into a 2002 election reform bill that would benefit them.\n\nLewandowski served as an administrative assistant to Ney from the end of 1997 to February 2001. Ney later pleaded guilty to helping Abramoff\u2019s clients between 2001 and 2004.\n\nAbramoff told The Daily Beast that he doesn\u2019t remember Lewandowski. \u201cI might have met him, but don\u2019t recall it,\u201d Abramoff said.\n\nAfter leaving Ney\u2019s office, Lewandowski went on to manage the re-election campaign of New Hampshire Senator Bob Smith, who lost the Republican primary in 2002. He later signed on with the Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity, where he worked before joining team Trump as a political adviser.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:32.865+0000"}
{"entityId": 1612, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why does Hillary Clinton\u2014the best-known female politician in the world\u2014feel a need to constantly reintroduce herself to the American people? Ana Marie Cox makes the case for authenticity over artifice.\n\nThe biggest problem with the premiere video out of Hillary Clinton\u2019s Brooklyn campaign headquarters isn\u2019t the video itself.\n\nYes, Clinton is benignly stiff; yes, the people-on-the-street interactions are credulously gushy and earnest. This is a defiantly non-hipster version of Brooklyn, complete with stroller cameos and an enthusiastic ethnic cabbie: \u201cI tell everybody in my car to vote for Hillary Clinton!\u201d he exclaims, suggesting that maybe there is a form of advertising more annoying than the auto-play mini-televisions in the back of New York taxis.\n\nNo, the problem with the video is that it\u2019s introduced as, \u201cHow do Brooklyn residents feel about their new neighbor?\u201d This is neither the question the video answers, nor is it the one anyone was asking. (And people are asking a lot of questions!) The question is a retro-fitted push-poll, reframing inoffensive fluff as faux-folksiness (\u201cfauxiness?\u201d). There\u2019s an inherent defensiveness that begs some kind of Upworthy twist: \u201cHow do Brooklyn residents feel about their new neighbor? The answer will leave you speechless!\u201d\n\nPresenting b-roll of Clinton on a celebrity stroll as how residents really feel just highlights how much the video is not genuine\u2014and how strongly the Clinton people want to convince you it is. It\u2019s not enough that the video shows Clinton performing standard famous-person duties with above-average grace (if not exactly ease); no, it has to be revelatory proof\u2014and not proof of something true about Clinton herself, but of how people feel about her.\n\nHillary\u2019s public relations battles have, for decades now, been fought in that strange meta arena: We argue not about who she is, but about how people perceive her. We don\u2019t debate whether she is genuine, but if people think she is.\n\nTo some extent, this is the default context for all political punditry. It is always easier to debate a nation\u2019s mood than to do the hard work of sussing out its needs. But Hillary Clinton is an especially provocative case, in part because her campaigns and advisers, again and again, choose to meet the pundits and the media in that Thunderdome of perception rather than in the real world. Even when they want to fight in the real world, they beg for a decision about perception: How do Brooklyn residents feel?\n\nThe Brooklyn video is, after all, yet another introduction of Hillary. And an introduction for a woman who\u2019s been in the public eye for three decades only makes sense in the context of Hillary\u2019s eternal reboot.\n\nAdvisers have been introducing her for so long, perhaps they forget that she\u2019s never really left the stage.\n\nAfter all, Hillary is perhaps the best known female politician in the world. And that makes this exercise of endless introductions feel like part Memento, part No Exit. Hillary seems stuck in the first 15 minutes of a cocktail party for all eternity, doomed to introduce herself over and over.\n\nWhat makes this absurdist play a real tragedy is that the non-stranger is a legitimately interesting person, someone you have already decided you like. If she didn\u2019t keep telling you her name, and underselling all the genuinely fascinating things about herself in favor of bland platitudes and awkward attempts to create common ground.\n\n\u201cI understand you were Secretary of State.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t grandchildren wonderful?\u201d\n\nHillary seems stuck in the first 15 minutes of a cocktail party for all eternity, compelled to introduce herself over and over.\n\n\u201cSure. What was it like to meet so many world leaders?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have a grandchild! Like many other ladies my age!\u201d\n\nOne can only endure so much of such a conversation before edging quietly away. Indeed, the beginning of Hillary\u2019s declining polling numbers wasn\u2019t Benghazi or the email scandal, it was when she left the State Department. It was when she stopped doing real work and started working on her image.\n\nIt\u2019s testament to Hillary\u2019s more substantial gifts\u2014beyond small talk\u2014that her constant effort to remake the first impression does not hurt her more. There is a talented administrator and passionate advocate behind every re-applied \u201cHello, my name is\u2026\u201d sticker on her pantsuit.\n\nVoters saw the woman behind the marketing campaign during the Lewinsky scandal, during her nose-to-the-grindstone turns in the Senate and State Department, and, most dramatically, between the cracks of the fa\u00e7ade during the 2008 campaign.\n\nHer moment of peak cultural penetration came with the \u201cHillary texting\u201d meme: a photo snapped of her unawares, immersed in a task, completely apart from the conversation we might have about her and exerting no control over it.\n\nPolls attest to how well Americans respond when Hillary stops shaking hands and just gets to work. These data points should direct her campaign away from telling us how to feel about her and instead to just letting her be herself.\n\nIronically, the other \u201cnew\u201d Hillary video out last week was also a re-introduction of sorts\u2014perhaps the very first: a half-hour interview from 1979 with young Hillary Rodham, recently having becoming the First Lady of Arkansas.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to pick apart what about the video doesn\u2019t \u201cwork\u201d for today\u2019s audiences. Mostly, it\u2019s the style, a preserved-in-acetate disco-librarian look: owlish glasses, Pepto-pink blazer and full skirt, and white turtleneck (though, the knee-high boots are pretty bitchin\u2019).\n\nBut it\u2019s really only the style that grates on a modern sensibility.\n\nThe interview itself is shockingly civil, though not without an undercurrent of sexism that dates the conversation. The public television host asks Ms. Rodham about keeping her name\u2014\u201cit lost [your husband] some votes\u201d\u2014and asserts that, \u201cIf you just wouldn\u2019t be a practicing attorney, you see, then that would eliminate some of the problems of not being together.\u201d He notes she doesn\u2019t seem \u201call that interested in state dinners and teas and garden parties.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s refreshing is how Ms. Rodham responds. She is straightforward but not chilly; she doesn\u2019t agree but doesn\u2019t argue\u2014on the garden party front, she says, \u201cI\u2019m interested in everything. I\u2019m interested in social events and civic events, as well as my own professional life.\u201d\n\nPressed on the issue of her keeping her name, asked if that maybe makes people consider her \u201ctoo liberal,\u201d she tells the interviewer, \u201cOne cannot live one\u2019s life based on what somebody else\u2019s image of you might be\u2026 All one can do is live the life that God gave you, and you know you just do the best you can, and if somebody likes you or doesn\u2019t like you that\u2019s really in many ways something that you have no control over.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the answer of someone who only needs to introduce herself once.\n\nSo what happened to her? Bill lost re-election after that first term. The defeat reportedly crushed them both, and when he ran again in 1982, his partner on the stump wasn\u2019t Ms. Rodham, but Mrs. Clinton. There is no way to read that change and not see at least a few grains of cynicism\u2014the same moral calculation that the Clintons have used to justify or excuse almost every twist in image or message since then.\n\nIn 1982, it worked. Bill won, his career continued to careen forward, and the lesson they took from that cynical rebranding has never been unlearned\u2014though I can\u2019t help wonder if it was the wrong lesson. Was it, after all, her rebranding as \u201cClinton\u201d that \u201cworked,\u201d or did Hillary Rodham\u2019s talents sway people, because she was that self-assured young woman in the kick-ass boots? Who did people see? Which Hillary are they actually supporting today?\n\nMaybe she does need to reintroduce herself. We\u2019ve been calling her by the wrong name for 23 years.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:33.588+0000"}

But what you learn, most of all, is that the characters propelling America\u2019s greatest political curiosity upward in the polls are a lot like the man himself.\n\nThe day started with Francine Aton, 62, Michigan, retired.\n\n\u201cYou work for The Daily Beast\u2014which is a more left-wing web-magazine,\u201d she began. \u201cI don\u2019t want something to come out that\u2019s slanted.\u201d\n\nAton, who said she has a degree in journalism, has little patience for reporters and detects liberal bias in the most innocuous of statements.\n\nAsked why she supports Trump (to the tune of $250), she said, \u201cBecause he speaks the truth, he\u2019s honest, and he can\u2019t be bought.\u201d So she likes him, I said, because he\u2019s wealthy and that means\u2014\u201cListen to how you just slanted that question!\u201d she cut me off. \u201cIs Hillary wealthy? Yes, she is!\u201d Well, what I meant was\u2014\u201cJust say what you mean! You\u2019re slanting your story.\u201d\n\nI explained that all I was trying to do was figure out why she supports Trump. \u201cWhy do you support him?\u201d she asked. Uh, I don\u2019t, I said. \u201cDonald speaks the truth. Thank you, goodbye.\u201d\n\nShe hung up.\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna win. I think he has a pretty good chance. I mean, people are outraged at the way Obama Hussein has run this country.\u201d\n\nNext was Timothy Doody, 51, Colorado, real estate appraiser.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he said when I asked why he donated $500 to Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t know why I do half the things I do. I was probably drunk.\u201d\n\nHe laughed. \u201cI\u2019m just kidding. I just think it\u2019s refreshing\u2026I just wanted to make a statement, that\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nDoody explained that he\u2019s a \u201cconservative-leaning person\u201d but a registered Democrat. Mostly, he sighed, \u201cI just am fed up with politicians. I do know [Trump\u2019s] negatives and I do know what he\u2019s done as far as supporting Democrats via his corporations and supporting both parties.\u201d But at the end of the day, Doody said, he liked that Trump could \u201crabble-rouse\u201d and \u201cmake waves.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s position on immigration, Doody admitted, was the central reason he made the donation, but he also believes Trump is the best person to repair the economy and to change the course of American foreign policy for the better.\n\nAnd speaking of immigration, \u201cThe other candidates totally took his words out of context,\u201d Doody said, referring to Trump\u2019s claim that undocumented immigrants coming into America from Mexico are \u201crapists.\u201d Doody said he listened to Trump\u2019s statement \u201cprobably 10 times\u201d to see if he had missed it, but in the end came to the conclusion that \u201che didn\u2019t call all Mexicans rapists.\u201d\n\nIn Trump\u2019s absence, Doody guessed he could find another candidate to support. \u201cProbably Ted Cruz, Governor Walker, maybe, and Rand Paul\u2026I don\u2019t understand Jeb Bush.\u201d\n\nThen came Damien Drab, 41, New York City, CEO of Loughlin Management, a company that \u201cdelivers a broad range of operational and financial consulting services with a results-oriented approach,\u201d as opposed to all those consulting firms who strive for no results at all.\n\nI told Drab I wanted to talk about his $500 donation to the Trump campaign. He laughed. \u201cGood, I hope that helps with my golf club membership.\u201d\n\nIs he a member of a Trump golf club? \u201cUh, I can\u2019t comment on anything, really,\u201d he said. \u201cI have one statement and that\u2019s: Why should anyone use their personal money for public affairs?\u201d\n\nFurther, Drab went on, it is \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cignorant\u201d to tell Trump he needs to use his personal wealth for his race when \u201ceverybody else who runs gets contributions.\u201d Because \u201cthere\u2019s no inherent personal wealth risk for people who run,\u201d Drab said, there shouldn\u2019t be one for a billionaire, either. Whether he needs the money is irrelevant, Drab argued, because \u201cif you believe in Trump, you should contribute.\u201d\n\nNext was Mike McNerney, 73, California, funeral service provider.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the greatest thing running,\u201d McNerney said when I asked about his $500 donation to Trump, which he called \u201cjust a show of support.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s gonna win,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think he has a pretty good chance. I mean, people are outraged at the way Obama Hussein has run this country.\u201d\n\nMcNerney said he likes Trump \u201cbecause he\u2019s nonpolitical. He tells it like it is. He\u2019s truthful, and he has more experience than being a short-term senator before he became president.\u201d What kind of experience does Trump have, I asked. \u201cAt life and management, and I\u2019m sure he has more foreign experience, which Obama Hussein has ruined.\u201d\n\nMcNerney agrees with Trump on immigration \u201cabsolutely, 1,000 percent,\u201d and believes those expressing disapproval of his statements are \u201cmanipulating the press for the benefit of opposition against any sensible immigration policy that comes along.\u201d\n\nI asked McNerney, who repeatedly referred to the president as \u201cObama Hussein,\u201d if he thought Obama was Muslim. He said, \u201cI know he is.\u201d I asked if he thought Obama was born in America. He replied, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. Probably Africa.\u201d Where in Africa, I wondered. \u201cWherever his father and his white mother were living.\u201d Kenya? \u201cYou got it,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd Dr. Dane Wallisch, 64, Pennsylvania, radiologist.\n\n\u201cWhy did I do it?\u201d Wallisch said when I asked about his $2,700 check to Trump\u2019s campaign. \u201cI think he would be a very strong leader, and I think that\u2019s what we need now. I have very similar beliefs to Donald Trump. I agree with him on just about everything.\u201d\n\nWallisch agreed with Doody that \u201cthe immigration thing, I think, the media took that way out of context.\u201d\n\nHe explained that having lived in Mexico for a time, he knows that the government there is corrupt. \u201cOf course there\u2019s good Mexican people, but there\u2019s bad with the good,\u201d he said. And the unsecured border, he told me, is \u201can open door for terrorists, as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump just speaks what\u2019s on his mind and I like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s refreshing. It\u2019s time people say what they felt rather than just what people want to hear.\u201d Wallisch apologized for \u201cgetting on my soapbox here,\u201d but admitted it was hard to avoid when talking about Trump. \u201cI like him and I hope he becomes president.\u201d\n\nWhy donate to a billionaire, though, I wondered. It\u2019s not like he needs it. \u201cTrue, probably true,\u201d Wallisch said. \u201cBut that was my way of saying, \u2018I support you.\u2019\u201d\n\nWithout Trump, Wallisch said he was sure he could find another candidate to support. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of good people running this year. I like Ben Carson\u2014you know who Ben Carson is, right? I like Rand Paul, but he won\u2019t make it. Scott Walker. Bush is all right, but three Bushes? I don\u2019t know.

O\u2019Rourke remembers the wit, wisdom, and politics of his friend John Hughes.\n\nSomehow\u2014while we Senior Teens in our forties, fifties and sixties weren\u2019t paying attention\u201430 years have elapsed since The Breakfast Club was released. To mark the anniversary, the movie will be screened in 430 U.S. theaters on March 26 and March 31. If you are a Judd Nelson/John Bender type who would rather not be seen crying in public, I suggest you don\u2019t go.\n\nThe Breakfast Club is John Hughes\u2019s masterwork. Unless Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off is John Hughes\u2019s masterwork. The latter is a shout from the peak of adolescent heights. The former is a call from the pit of adolescent depths. In the sea-level bog of middle age, they\u2019ll both make you weep. I watched The Breakfast Club, as it were, home alone.\n\nAnd I was missing John, who died of cardiac arrest six years ago at 59. I met him in the mid-1970s when he was the youngest vice president ever at Leo Burnett and\u2014for the Ferris Bueller of it\u2014was writing freelance articles in the National Lampoon. I was an editor there. John wrote so fast and so well that it was hard for a monthly magazine to keep up with him.\n\nI had an idea for a \u201cNational Lampoon Sunday Newspaper Parody.\u201d It would be a full replica of a big fat Midwestern local paper of the kind extant back then\u2014 The Dacron, Ohio, Sunday Republican-Democrat. Dacron was an imaginary city that Doug Kenny and I had created for the \u201cNational Lampoon 1964 High School Yearbook Parody,\u201d published a few years before. John agreed to co-edit the newspaper parody.\n\nA few excepts from John\u2019s voluminous contributions:\n\nExtended Forecast\n\nCold this winter. Turning warmer in the spring. Then hot and humid all summer. A period of cooling will follow in autumn. Then cold and wintery next winter.\n\nCitizen Foils Telephone Pest\n\nMiss Anna Gribble who called police last week to report continuing threats and abuse from an anonymous phone-caller calling her at 262-6449, has had her phone number removed from listing and changed to 261-6338.\n\nThe kids don\u2019t try to abolish authority and institutions. They elude and modify them with wit.\n\nIn the \u201cPersonals\u201d section of the Classified Ads\n\nKaren. HAPPY VALENTINES DAY even if no boys sent you any cards.\u2014Dad\n\nIt would be nice to think that Doug\u2019s and my imaginary Dacron gave John Hughes the inspiration for imaginary Shermer, Illinois, where most of his Bildungsroman movies are set. But John was always making worlds in his head. John had the kind of creativity you don\u2019t see much of outside Genesis chapters 1 and 2.\n\nJohn told me he knew everyone in Shermer, not just the people in his movies. He knew where they lived and what they did for a living. He could tell you about the amities, enmities, passing acquaintanceships, extramarital relations and distant cousinhoods of assistant principal Vernon, the Benders, the Standishes, the fellow Breakfast Club families of Reynoldses, Clarks and Johnsons plus the ever-vacationing Griswolds, the always-losing-a-kid McCallisters, and Uncle Buck\u2019s bookie.\n\nJohn was the best, the easiest, the most productive and collaborative person with whom I\u2019ve ever worked. Which sounds like a load of de mortuis nil nisi bonum, except that I, unlike John, don\u2019t have the imagination to make up somebody like John.\n\nWhen I became editor in chief of the National Lampoon at the end of 1978, the first thing I did was call John at Leo Burnett and say, \u201cI can pay you less.\u201d But I couldn\u2019t get him to move his family from Chicago to New York. \u201cNew York City would be okay,\u201d he said, \u201cif they\u2019d clean the place up and move everything back ten feet.\u201d\n\nIn the aftermath of National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House success everyone at the magazine had the opportunity to make movies. Only John had movies to make.\n\nJohn created Shermer, but, per Genesis chapter 3, he gave its residents free will. About Ferris Bueller, John said, \u201cThat kid will either become President of the United State or go to prison.\u201d I said they were not mutually exclusive.\n\nPolitics being another bond I had with John. I\u2019m not sure he\u2019d be happy with me talking about his politics. He was a private man. But John\u2019s politics have been discussed before. John was identified as a Reaganite in a somewhat inchoate 2006 Slate article by Michael Weiss, the point of which seemed to be that Michael Weiss was still miffed about the Reagan era. And, the same year, in an interview on Showbiz Tonight, Ben Stein (\u201cEconomics Teacher\u201d in Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off) said, \u201cJohn Hughes and I are among the only Republicans in the picture business.\u201d\n\nI wouldn\u2019t agree with either Weiss or Stein. I have no idea how, or if, John voted. We never bothered to talk about it. And there\u2019s nothing very JUST SAY NO about all the kids in The Breakfast Club (except the presumably this-is-your-brain-on-drugs Ally Sheedy/Allison Reynolds) getting high as the squirrels on Miss Anna Gribble\u2019s telephone wire.\n\nJohn and I never bothered to talk much about our politics. What we did talk about was the 20th century\u2019s dominant scrambled egghead bien pensant buttinski parlor pinko righty-tighty lefty-loosey nutfudge notion that middle-class American culture was junk, that middle-class Americans were passive dimbulbs, that America itself was a flop and that America\u2019s suburbs were a living hell almost beyond the power of John Cheever\u2019s words to describe.\n\nJohn said, \u201cYou remember the line in The Graduate where the party guest tells the Dustin Hoffman character, \u2018I just want to say one word to you. Just one word. Plastics.\u2019 That was 1967. If the Dustin Hoffman character had gotten into plastics he\u2019d be a millionaire by now, instead of riding on a city bus with a crazy girl in a wedding dress.\u201d\n\nWe were becoming conservatives\u2014in the most conservational sense. There were things that others before us had achieved and these were worth conserving.\n\nJohn went first. At 20, he married his high school girl friend Nancy Ludwig and stayed married to her for the rest of his life and set up housekeeping and realized he had to make a living.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t go looking for a job wearing what people were wearing in 1970,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t really know where to buy clothes that people weren\u2019t wearing in 1970. I remembered that before I became hip my mother used to take me to Brooks Brothers in the Loop. So I went there. Behind the shirt counter was the same sales lady who\u2019d been behind the shirt counter when I was a kid. She looked at me for a moment and said, \u2018I knew you\u2019d be back.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn 1976 John and Nancy had a son, John Hughes III, and in 1979 they\u2019d have another, James. Family was the most conservative thing about John. Walking across the family room in your stocking feet and stepping on a Lego (ouch!) was the fundamental building block of society.\n\nJohn would do nothing (such as move to New York or, later, stay in Hollywood) to jeopardize his family. But he had a mortgage, a 3-year-old and another child on the way when he left the serious paycheck of Leo Burnett to work at the National Lampoon for birdseed. John must have thought that gambling on humor was a conservative wager.\n\nAnd humor was another conservative thing about John. We talked a lot about humor. It isn\u2019t\u2014as it\u2019s often assumed to be\u2014shocking, radical, transgressive or just a way to make people laugh. You can do that by farting. The root meaning of humor (Latin humorem, \u201cfluid\u201d) comes from medieval ideas of physiology in which personal traits were determined by the Cardinal Humours, blood, phlegm, choler and melancholy. And if you\u2019ve ever raised that fundamental building block of society, a family, \u201cblood, phlegm, choler and melancholy\u201d pretty much covers it.\n\nHere\u2019s an almost 3,000-year-old Chinese joke about institutional corruption that John and I were fond of:\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s cook is slicing meat and hiding half the slices in his apron. \u201cA slice for me. A slice for the Emperor. A slice for me. A slice for the Emperor.\u201d The cook\u2019s wife says, \u201cStupid, you\u2019re at home.\u201d\n\nYou can search the works of Marx, Engles, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Mao, and Patty Hearst when she was \u201cTania\u201d in the Symbionese Liberation Army for humor, and in vain.\n\nLike all of John\u2019s movies, The Breakfast Club is conservative. Note that the first thing the disgruntled kids in detention do is not organize a protest, not express \u201cclass (of 1985) solidarity,\u201d not chant \u201cStudents of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your locker combinations\u201d and not claim it takes a Shermer to raise them.\n\nThey present themselves, like good conservatives do, as individuals and place the highest value, like this conservative does, on goofing off. Otherwise known as individual liberty.\n\nImagine, painfully, a 2015 remake of The Breakfast Club. Latino-American, African-American, Islamic-American, Born-Again Christian, Undocumented Alien, Feminist, Post-Feminist, Occupy Activist, Tea Party Member, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender\u2026 To cover all the bases of Identity Politics, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez and Anthony Michael Hall would have had to double- and triple-up. And wear some strange cosmetics.\n\nJohn kept his characters alike as possible, within the spectrum of high school anthropology, in order to make them as different as possible, within the spectrum of individuals. All five members of the Breakfast Club have Anglo-Saxon last names. All are attractive. They could be related (and John would have known) if five bland WASPy sisters had married two brunettes, two blonds and a redhead of varying abilities and intellects.\n\nJohn worked with types but wouldn\u2019t let them represent kinds. Claire Standish may be elected Prom Queen, but she isn\u2019t the elected representative of the silk stocking district in the Congress of High School Detention. Nor has Shermer been gerrymandered to make sure that John Bender is the official representative of the under-employed labor force facing wage stagnation.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing revolutionary about The Breakfast Club. On purpose. The kids don\u2019t try to abolish authority and institutions. They elude and modify them with wit. This is a comedy. The total abolition of authority and institutions would be a tragedy. If you get rid of all authority and institutions, worse authority and institutions arise in their place. Any historical examples to the contrary since 1776 had escaped John\u2019s (and my) notice.\n\nThat the kids\u2019 troubles all stem from their families isn\u2019t an accident of lazy writing. John was never lazy about back-story, or anything else. It\u2019s that fundamental building block. The Lego that got stepped on matters more than the ugly Lego structures of authority and institutions.\n\nTo make them funny, the Breakfast Club members are subject to the Cardinal Humours\u2014hoodlum Judd Nelson/John Bender\u2019s blood, brianiac Anthony Michael Hall/Brian Ralph Johnson\u2019s phlegm, jock Emilio Estevez/Andy Clark\u2019s choler, basket case Ally Sheedy/Allison Reynolds\u2019s melancholy and popular girl Molly Ringwald/Claire Standish\u2019s (what I think of as the fifth Cardinal Humor) being a popular girl.\n\nTo make them conservative, they immediately start operating upon the three basic principles in The Wealth of Nations by that conservative fundamental block builder Adam Smith: Pursuit of self-interest, division of labor and freedom of trade.\n\nNo member of the Breakfast Club questions pursuit of self-interest, though it takes the five of them the whole movie to figure out where their self-interests lie. Even apparently self-destructive Allison Reynolds abjures from mind-altering substances, her mind being altered plenty enough already. And manifestly self-destructive John Bender declines to take a fatal punch at assistant principal Vernon, no matter how well-deserved.\n\nDivision of labor is the theme of the movie. Each kid discovers what\u2019s valuable in the others. And\u2014cue sentimental conservative favorite \u201cDon\u2019t You (Forget About Me)\u201d by Simple Minds\u2014what\u2019s valuable in him or her self.\n\nFreedom of trade is the message of the movie. Albeit the trade is conducted in the coin of the adolescent realm, love.\n\nBut not just the face-suck love of Claire and Bender or Andy and Allison. A good conservative knows his Western Civ. And the only thing that\u2019s made Civ. in the West worthwhile is love. So much so that the ancient Greeks had four names for it.\n\nStorage\u2014acceptance, the first thing the Breakfast Club learns.\n\nPhilia\u2014friendship among equals, the best thing the Breakfast Club learns.\n\nEros\u2014Claire and Bender, Andy and Allison.\n\nAgape\u2014love for the whole world, Shermer, Illinois, included. Brian Ralph Johnson triumphant with his manifesto (signed \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d) to assistant principal Vernon, who may have been feeling a little agape himself, drinking beer in the school basement with the janitor.\n\nIt\u2019s a sentimental movie\u2014influenced more by emotion than reason. John hedges his bets with a speech by Claire about how the members of the Breakfast Club will all go back to ignoring each other at school on Monday. But I doubt John believed that. Plus I am, like many conservatives, a sentimental guy. As Finley Peter Dunne\u2014the best Chicago humorist until John Hughes\u2014had his Irish barkeep Mr. Dooley say, \u201cDamp eye, dry heart.\u201d\n\nI didn\u2019t cry at John\u2019s funeral. His death was too shocking, radical, transgressive. But after his burial, when I drove out the gates of Lake Forest Cemetery, I saw something I hadn\u2019t seen in 45 years. It was a little sign reading \u201cCemetery Road\u201d above a bar across a sandy track along the cemetery\u2019s wall.\n\nFor a couple of years in the 1960s I had, like John, gone to a suburban Chicago high school. On Friday and Saturday nights when the weather was warm kids from suburban Chicago high schools would park on Lake Forest\u2019s residential streets, walk stealthily to Cemetery Road, slip under the bar and sneak down the sandy track to the Lake Michigan beach. It was an inversion of the Shermer High School detention experience with all sorts of assistant principal Vernon-like people such as the Lake Forest police trying to keep us out rather than in. Sometimes we had to hide in the dunes with our Budweiser and beach towels.\n\nMaybe John and I had been there at the same time. We were only three grades apart. Anyway, Cemetery Beach was where the hoods and the jocks and the dweebs and the basket cases and the popular girls worked it out in our day. That\u2019s where we signed our social contract.\n\nWhen I saw Cemetery Road, then I began to cry.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:33.944+0000"}

The two walked through Parkway Gardens, an apartment complex along O Block, after Paul\u2019s speech to his congregation.\n\nBrooks isn\u2019t the only person to believe a great change must occur for inner cities across the country to be able to break free from the poverty and crime that envelope them. But the pastor is looking to a different source than others for that change, one that doesn\u2019t usually count O Block among its campaign stops: Republicans.\n\nLook around the neighborhood that contains O Block\u2014Woodlawn\u2014and you\u2019ll see why, Brooks said.\n\n\u201cWe have a large, disproportionate number of people who are impoverished. We have a disproportionate number of people who are incarcerated, we have a disproportionate number of people who are unemployed, the educational system has totally failed, and all of this primarily has been under Democratic regimes in our neighborhoods,\u201d Brooks said from the office of New Beginnings Church of Chicago, his own, Wednesday morning. \u201cSo, the question for me becomes, how can our neighborhoods be doing so awful and so bad when we\u2019re so loyal to this party who is in power? It\u2019s a matter of them taking complete advantage of our vote.\u201d\n\nSo Brooks has mobilized.\n\nNot only did he take it upon himself to bring Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner to New Beginnings as he ran to become the first Republican to lead the state in more than two decades, but Brooks also supported Rauner, something that didn\u2019t exactly come roaring out of Chicago\u2019s South Side.\n\nAnd while Brooks has yet to announce publicly who he supports for president, his political leanings are well known in his church and around Woodlawn.\n\n\u201cThey have a failing plan,\u201d he said of Democrats. \u201cA business owner wouldn\u2019t allow the person who runs it to remain in charge for 50 years, constantly running it into the ground.\u201d\n\nBut the reason he invited all active presidential candidates to New Beginnings isn\u2019t to secure votes for the GOP, he said, but to give members of the community the opportunity to be as informed an electorate as possible.\n\nAnd why not? Since the civil rights movement blacks have overwhelmingly voted for Democrats, both on the national and local levels, Brooks noted.\n\nBut the results simply aren\u2019t there.\n\n\u201cThey have a failing plan,\u201d he said of Democrats. \u201cA business owner wouldn\u2019t allow the person who runs it to remain in charge for 50 years, constantly running it into the ground.\u201d\n\nA political science major at Ball State University, Brooks moved to Chicago 20 years ago from his hometown of Muncie, Indiana. In addition to his church, a bustling hub of activity that includes a spacious worship room complete with projection screens and theater seating, Brooks is preparing to break ground on a community center just across Martin Luther King Jr. Drive \u2014 without any government assistance, naturally.\n\nWhen he first moved to the city he kept his political opinions to himself, not wanting to rock the boat, but after seeing a lack of progress he \u201ccouldn\u2019t stomach it.\u201d There is tension, he said, because growing up black on the South Side of Chicago means, for many, \u201cYou are a Democrat. Period.\u201d\n\nThat has led to the Democratic Party taking the black vote for granted, Brooks said.\n\n\u201cAnd we don\u2019t want anyone from any party taking us for granted.\u201d\n\nAcross the board, it seems, Brooks is a Republican.\n\nHe spoke in strong terms about unions\u2014\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how many guys come to me and tell they\u2019re locked out of the trade unions for this reason or that,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cAnd in Chicago, the unions control everything.\u201d\n\nThe pastor is in favor of legally possessing guns, even on the bullet-riddled South Side. And he blames the breakdown of the black family, partly due to social programs that \u201cpenalize\u201d those who wish to marry and prevent them from continuing to receive government assistance, for the culture of violence that is so pervasive in urban areas from Woodlawn to West Baltimore.\n\n\u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t even begin to get into the music and entertainment aspects of it,\u201d Brooks said.\n\nBrooks is not an anomaly, either. But overcoming the power and pressure of the Democratic Party\u2019s relationship with the black community, despite its stance on social issues that often lean conservative, isn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cIn quiet areas,\u201d Brooks said, \u201cthis is something we talk about.\u201d\n\nSome have replied to Brooks\u2019s request to stop by his church for what he\u2019s calling the American Urban Issues Presidential Series. While Paul is the only Republican to make the trip, so far, Brooks said he heard back from the campaigns of Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, and Bernie Sanders.\n\nFor Brooks, exposing his congregation and neighbors in Woodlawn to Republican politics is simply part of a conversation that has yet to be had, a new and sometimes unsettling interaction.\n\nBut, in an age where many in the black community may be just as concerned with the police who patrol their neighborhoods as they are the politicians who control them, Republican presidential hopefuls early in a long campaign might not be the biggest draw.\n\nStill, Brooks said, Democrats must be held accountable for their inaction. And the GOP, as imperfect a sell as it may be for African Americans, seems the most viable alternative.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a class of African Americans who have gone on to be very successful, and we\u2019re grateful and thankful for that,\u201d Brooks said, noting the progress of the civil rights movement and the decades of Democratic success at winning the black vote in the decades that followed. \u201cBut with their success, some of them didn\u2019t bring it back to the community.\u201d\n\nFor Republicans to break into that stronghold, though, they have to show up. Luckily for them, Corey Brooks has a church on Martin Luther King Jr. Drive that will welcome them.

Many would say the question tripping up 2016 hopefuls Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio is worth asking\u2014but not the neoconservatives who pushed for the war.\n\nThe Iraq hypotheticals currently ensnaring the Republican Party\u2019s presidential candidates are \u201casinine\u201d and the worst of \u201cgotcha journalism,\u201d argue some of the neoconservative thinkers who advocated most aggressively for the 2003 invasion.\n\nQuestioning whether the United States should have gone to war in Iraq is pointless, they say, because decision-makers never get to make future decisions with the benefit of hindsight.\n\n\u201cNobody lives life backwards,\u201d said Eliot Cohen, a founding member of the Project for a New American Century and later a top aide to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \u201cAt the time, reasonable people could disagree over whether to go to war in Iraq. It\u2019s really a silly hypothetical, and the people who ask it should know better. You don\u2019t get to relive history that way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt reflects more on the media\u2019s obsession with a new litmus test,\u201d said Danielle Pletka, the vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cOne isn\u2019t president or commander in chief in hindsight.\u201d\n\nThe United States continues to suffer the consequences of the Iraq war: thousands of American lives lost at a cost of billions of dollars. Assessments after the initial invasion found that the massive weapons of mass destruction program the Bush administration used as one of the primary reasons to go to war simply didn\u2019t exist.\n\nAnd in the instability that followed the U.S. withdrawal from the country, another deadly terrorist group emerged: the so-called Islamic State, which has beheaded Americans and threatens U.S. allies in the region.\n\nSo the price of invasion has certainly been very steep, and worth assessing.\n\nThe press has savaged Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio over the past week for saying both that the invasion of Iraq was the right decision and that they would not have invaded Iraq with the benefit of current knowledge\u2014that intelligence assessments of Iraq\u2019s WMD program were wildly incorrect.\n\nIn the years after the invasion of Iraq, neoconservatives have expressed few regrets about their efforts to encourage the toppling of Saddam Hussein via invasion.\n\nBill Kristol, the founder and editor of the hawkish Weekly Standard, said that even knowing what we know now, he would have still pushed for an invasion.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an asinine question that says more about the politicization of debate than it does about the candidates themselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen would have surged troops much earlier,\u201d he said, \u201cand would not have thrown it all away after the war was effectively won at the end of 2008.\u201d\n\nBut Kristol doesn\u2019t hold it against Republicans like Bush and Rubio for thinking differently: \u201cCan\u2019t blame candidates for not wanting to spend time and effort taking on the politically correct No position,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd those who disagree with The Weekly Standard\u2019s editor, one of the most ardent advocates of the invasion, shouldn\u2019t expect an apology. In an email to The Daily Beast, Kristol signed off:\n\n\u201cUnapologetically,\n\nBill\u201d\n\nThe Iraq question, first asked by Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly of Jeb Bush, should not have been unexpected. Nor was it inconsequential: The heart of the question is whether, absent the threat of a major Iraqi WMD program, the invasion of Iraq was still wise.\n\nBut both Cohen and Pletka said the structure of the question pointed to something deeper about American press coverage of American politicians\u2014the desire to catch a politician off guard in a moment of uncertainty rather than trying to achieve a deeper understanding of where candidates stand on various issues and how they would react in a crisis.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s an asinine question that says more about the politicization of debate than it does about the candidates themselves,\u201d Pletka said.\n\nCohen, who wrote his first book in 1978 and joined the policy planning staff of the office of the secretary of defense in 1990, called the \u201cgotcha journalism\u201d view of foreign policy poisonous and counterproductive\u2014and said it is more prevalent now than in previous years.\n\n\u201cIn past eras in the United States, people would have serious conversations about foreign policy\u2026which is going to be necessary, because the world is now such a complicated place,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cPeople are going to [need] the patience to examine each of the candidates on both sides and get a sense of where they stand.\u201d\n\nThe press, he said, should focus on building up a \u201ccomposite portrait\u201d of presidential candidates and their foreign policy views on China and on Iran.\n\nAdded Pletka, \u201cWouldn\u2019t you rather hear what they would do now about Iraq? Now that\u2019s a harder question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyone in their right mind hasn\u2019t been happy if you look at Iraq\u2014you certainly have to ask yourself [about] the return that we got for the investment in blood and treasure...People should ask themselves what are the lessons to be learned from the whole Iraqi experience,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nWhile he dismissed the current GOP debate as a \u201csilly hypothetical,\u201d Cohen did say revisiting the Iraq War is necessary. He identified three areas presidential candidates should be questioned about on Iraq: What the war taught us about America\u2019s ability to acquire intelligence on weapons of mass destruction programs; the ability of the U.S. government to adapt to challenges such as counterinsurgency and building up a foreign military, and how to disengage properly after an invasion.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:34.340+0000"}
{"entityId": 1617, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The LGBT community is threatening boycotts and canceling benefits. The hidden reason is the GOP\u2019s Israel strategy.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever been to Fire Island Pines, one of the leading gay utopias on the planet, you know that there isn\u2019t much to do. There\u2019s only one commercial center with a couple of stores, a bar, and a hotel.\n\nAnd yet, in less than 24 hours, over 4,000 people have said they\u2019re going to boycott it. The reason? It\u2019s owned by Ian Reisner and Mati Weiderpass, the self-described \u201cprominent NYC hotel owners\u201d who recently hosted a \u201cfireside chat\u201d with Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz.\n\nNo Tea Dance at the Sip n\u2019 Twirl? Hard to believe, but that\u2019s LGBT politics for you.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough, Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS went one step further, canceling their their \"Broadway Bares Solo Strips\" benefit. It had been scheduled for May 10 at the Out Hotel, which Reisner and Weiderpass own. \u201cI have never considered that all of our many supporters would ever vote monolithically,\u201d executive director Tom Viola wrote on his Facebook page. \u201cBut when any politician publicly holds so many of us in contempt\u2026 we cannot be misunderstood as standing with him/her.\u201d\n\nThis is Ted Cruz, after all, one of 19 members of Congress on the Human Rights Campaign\u2019s \u201cHall of Shame,\u201d the man who authored the 2014 \u201cState Marriage Defense Act,\u201d which would ensure that gay people get no federal protections, ever. And who recently penned a letter sent to tens of thousands of Christian pastors, asking them to pray, preach, and presumably vote for him to support \u201cbiblical marriage.\u201d\n\n(Biblical marriage is actually polygamy and concubinage, but I digress.)\n\nThe first question many people must be asking themselves is, what the hell were Reisner and Weiderpass thinking? In the words of gay performer and humorist Justin Sayre, who is supporting the boycott, \u201cOf all the people in the world to invite to a gay party, Ted Cruz? What was it? His sparkling wit? His fair and balanced repartee? Do you have a thing for Canadians? Does he make a mean gin rickey?\u201d\n\nNot quite. In a self-serving press release, the two said they \u201cignited a dialogue\u201d on the issue of same-sex marriage.\n\nBut that\u2019s not it either. In fact, before the backlash hit, they told The New York Times the real reason for the event:\n\nMr. Reisner and Kalman Sporn, who advises Mr. Cruz\u2019s Middle East team and served as the moderator for the evening, said the senator told the group that marriage should be left up to the states. The evening focused primarily on foreign policy, including a discussion of gay rights in Israel versus the rest of the Middle East, and opposition to President Obama.\n\nIn other words, this was about Israel.\n\nNotice who the moderator was: Ted Cruz\u2019s Jewish/Israel point man, himself a gay Jewish man and longtime Republican consultant.\n\nNor was this the first time Ian Reisner has hosted a Republican benefit at his home for that reason. Earlier this month, his Central Park South penthouse\u2014where, incidentally, a 23-year-old gay man was found dead of a drug overdose just a few months ago\u2014hosted a fundraiser for Republican Senator Ron Johnson.\n\nShamelessly invoking the Holocaust, Reisner said at the time that his great aunt \u201cwas murdered in Auschwitz\u201d and that \u201cwe are not too far from history to be wary of politicians who make bad decisions that threaten our lives. The deal with Iran concerns me. Anti-Semitic murder in Paris and Copenhagen concerns me. Bringing Senator Johnson to New York to discuss foreign policy and security helped educate my close friends about these very real issues.\u201d\n\nReisner is hardly alone in this regard. Gay porn king Michael Lucas -- who was not at the event in question -- has been outspoken in his support of Israel\u2019s right-wing government, going so far as to bully New York\u2019s LGBT Center into banning a pro-Palestinian group from meeting there. (After a yearlong brouhaha, the center banned both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian groups.)\n\nYou can\u2019t pull the one thread you like out of the tapestry; the whole thing unravels.\n\nLucas has often \u201cdiscussed\u201d the contrast between \u201cgay rights in Israel versus the rest of the Middle East.\u201d This is what\u2019s known as pinkwashing, the highlighting of Israel\u2019s excellent record on LGBT equality as a way of defending its totally unrelated policies regarding Palestine or Iran. Israel is pro-gay, therefore support Israel in all ways.\n\nLikewise, conservatives like Cruz, who write laws preventing my partner from visiting me in the hospital, suddenly wave the rainbow flag when it comes to Iran.\n\nIn other words, what happened in that penthouse was part of a much larger pattern of gay Jewish Republicans putting LGBT civil rights aside, and putting Israel First.\n\nNow, maybe this should be all right. After all, why should gay people have to be single-issue voters? Sure, Cruz is bad on LGBT issues (very bad, in fact), but why should that be the only issue on which a politician is judged? Maybe Cruz loses 10 points on the gay thing, but wins so many points on Israel that the benefits outweigh the costs.\n\nThis, basically, is what Reisner has been saying in his recent press blitz. On Facebook, he said that \u201cfor my entire adult life, I have been an ardent supporter and activist for gay rights and LGBT organizations worldwide. I was given the opportunity to have a candid conversation with Senator Ted Cruz on where he stood on issues including the state of Israel and national security, which are the only places where we share common ground.\u201d\n\nReisner added that he\u2019d just hosted a \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d benefit at the Out Hotel.\n\nSo, should LGBT folks cut Reisner some slack?\n\nNo.\n\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that Reisner and Weiderpass are rich, white, cisgender men cozying up to another rich, white, cisgender man. They may be gay, but they profoundly don\u2019t get it\u2014the \u201cit\u201d being that the same privilege that oppresses gays is the privilege that oppresses people of color, immigrants, women, and the poor\u2014precisely the groups that Cruz\u2019s policies would hurt the most.\n\nIt\u2019s not a coincidence that Cruz is anti-gay and also anti-social-safety net, anti-reproductive justice, and anti-affirmative action. What extremely fortunate white gay men like Reisner and Weiderpass don\u2019t understand is that it\u2019s all one big package: the classism, the religious conservatism, the social conservatism\u2014these all go together.\n\n\u201cA Gays\u201d like Reisner act as though Republicans just happen to have a blind spot when it comes to gays, but otherwise they\u2019re just fine. They can\u2019t understand why the LGBT Log Cabin Republicans, for example, have such a rough go of it. If only the GOP could get over this particular prejudice, then there\u2019s no reason why gay people shouldn\u2019t support them.\n\nBut it\u2019s not one particular prejudice. Right-wing extremists are extremist through and through. It\u2019s a whole package.\n\nAnd that includes Israel. Hard-right conservatives are hard-right on Israel for the same reasons they\u2019re hard-right on anti-LGBT and anti-choice politics. They\u2019ve got one extreme conservative narrative: It\u2019s us versus them, Americans versus the gays, Freedom Lovers versus Muslims, civilization versus barbarism. Iran, Palestinians, gay people, poor people, \u201cillegal immigrants,\u201d welfare queens, rowdy young black men\u2014these are bad people. These kinds of dogmatic conservative values are clear, unmistakable, unshakeable.\n\nTo be sure, not every foreign policy hawk, Republican, or conservative thinks this way. But Ted Cruz is a moralist on Iran the same way he is a moralist on family values.\n\nThat\u2019s why Reisner and Weiderpass don\u2019t deserve a pass. Supporting Ted Cruz isn\u2019t a matter of weighing his hawkish Iran views against his backward anti-gay views, because they are but two aspects of a consistent, conservative ideology that also includes climate denial, allowing the wealth gap to increase, and dismantling the social safety net. You can\u2019t pull the one thread you like out of the tapestry; the whole thing unravels.\n\nI have no doubt that Reisner is sincere when he says he supports LGBT equality. But the reason to do so shouldn\u2019t be in order to win rights for a few, privileged people like him. It should be in order to question assumptions of us and them, whoever the \u201cthem\u201d is said to be. It should be about justice.\n\nUPDATE 4/28/15: This article has been updated to make it clear that Michael Lucas was not at the Cruz event. In an email, Lucas told The Daily Beast, \u201cI do not support Ted Cruz and I do not want to be used as a tool to promote the false claim that gay Jewish conservatives are more loyal to Israel than to gay rights in America.\u201d\n\n", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:34.651+0000"}

The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that the number of refugees fleeing Syria now exceeds 4 million, the largest refugee crisis in the UN agency\u2019s history.\n\nCruz\u2019s statement stands in stark contrast to his family story, which he frequently on the campaign trail uses to highlight the American dream and the importance of a country that values freedom and liberty. That story is about his father, Rafael Cruz, who fled Cuba to the United States after enduring torture at the hands of the Batista regime.\n\n\n\n\u201cAmerica, quite simply, saved my father. America gave him a chance\u2026 The freedom of America was the dream that allowed him to endure the brutality of Cuba. It was and is a beacon of hope for all those who, like him, have endured oppression,\u201d Cruz wrote in his recent memoir, A Time for Truth.\n\nIn early 2014, Cruz seemed to be singing a different tune: \u201cWe have welcomed refugees, the tired, huddled masses, for centuries\u2014that\u2019s been the history of the United States. We should continue to do so,\u201d he said in a Fox segment about Syrian refugees. \u201cWe have to continue to be vigilant to make sure those coming are not affiliated with the terrorists. But we can do that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmerica, quite simply, saved my father. America gave him a chance,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nThe United States has been particularly closed off to Syrian refugees: as of June, NPR reported, America has taken in fewer than 1,000 Syrian refugees out of more than 4 million fleeing the country.\n\n\u201cSen. Cruz is advocating for humanitarian assistance to the refugees from both Syria and Iraq and North Africa,\u201d Cruz spokesperson Catherine Frazier told The Daily Beast. \u201cHowever, given the logistical challenges and the security risk posed by resettling large numbers of them far afield in the U.S., he is not in favor of this plan if the ultimate intent is to return them to their homes. As I\u2019m sure you are aware, Cuba is 90 miles from the United States, so this was not the case with the senator\u2019s father.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s position is especially frustrating for advocates who have been urging the United States to do more to confront the Assad regime and aid Syrian refugees. Evan Barrett, a political adviser to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, a Syrian-American opposition umbrella group, called Cruz\u2019s Tuesday remarks \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is obvious that the Cruz campaign feels compelled by recent events to develop a position on the Syria refugee crisis. But not referencing the Assad regime, whose aerial attacks are the primary progenitor of refugees\u2026 suggest a campaign that\u2019s in over its head,\u201d Barrett said. \u201cResettling refugees will not end the conflict, nor allow regular Syrians to return to their stolen lives. However, for a presidential candidate whose Syria policy is as shallow as our current president\u2019s, a more compassionate, informed stance on resettlement would be a good place to start.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe continued, \u201cCruz is right that rather than a patchwork refugee resettlement plan, Syria requires a political solution. However, like our current president, Cruz offers no policy substance as to how to get there. This bold rhetorical stance\u2014committing to destroying ISIS and fostering a climate for political negotiations\u2014without any policy substance is the exact disease that plagues our current administration.\u201d\n\n\n\nCruz blamed \u201cradical Islamism\u201d as the root cause for both the Shiite and Sunni violence in the region, arguing Tuesday that \u201cultimately, we need to address the cause of this crisis or we will just have more and more migrants displaced.\u201d But the Texas senator didn\u2019t explain what strategy might be.\n\nIn 2013, Cruz opposed airstrikes against the Assad regime, and later opposed arming the Syrian rebels. He wrote in The Washington Post that Assad was \u201cnot a direct threat to U.S. national security\u2026 Unilaterally avenging humanitarian disaster\u2026 is well outside the traditional scope of U.S. military action.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur immediate role should be to support our regional allies who are on the front lines through public and private assistance to the international organizations who are best poised to administer aid,\u201d Cruz said Tuesday.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:34.895+0000"}

Too bad all so many people can see is \u201cthugs.\u201d\n\nThe supposedly sophisticated twitterati take on what has happened after Freddie Gray\u2019s funeral is to essentially rationalize the riots by explaining that the looting we\u2019ve seen on our TV screens was just collateral damage for institutional racism.\n\nPut aside for the moment that many of the businesses and cars destroyed in the attacks were black-owned. Put aside also that Baltimore\u2019s mayor and police chief are black. Nevertheless, there are indeed structural issues that have combined to create this moment\u2014but they don\u2019t fit the narrative being proposed as higher wisdom.\n\nGALLERY: Chaos in Baltimore Deepens (PHOTOS)\n\n\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty\n\nFor example, several studies have shown that it\u2019s an op-ed page street myth that mass unemployment is inevitable when factory jobs move away from a city as they did in Baltimore (sources here). No people who had accomplished the Great Migration went to pieces just because a factory moved to the suburbs, or even China.\n\nThree key dynamics since the Civil Rights era 50 years ago created the inner-city misery we are now seeing urgently rise to the foreground today.\n\nFirst, the Black Power ideology that proliferated in the 1960s and \u201970s discouraged black communities from maintaining the old-time mantra that adversity meant that blacks have to try twice as hard. The wise insight was that after centuries in the United States, the persistent double standard was demeaning, and while that made basic sense, it changed black America\u2019s orientation towards individual initiative. That helps explain, for example, why only in the \u201960s did it become common for poor blacks to burn their own neighborhoods in protest. Even amidst Jim Crow, black people did not do this.\n\nSecond, in the late \u201960s, partly in response to the riots of the Long Hot Summers, welfare was transformed from a time-limited program intended for widows to an open-ended program that didn\u2019t care whether recipients ever got jobs. This had the unintended consequence of discouraging marriage, and made it easier for women to raise kids without the father around. This, a story too little told (read it here), decisively impacted the black experience nationwide.\n\nFinally, the War on Drugs created a black market alternative to legal work for poor black men underserved by bad schools. Frankly, The Wire explained this dynamic better than any academic analysis.\n\nRacism is too simplistic an explanation for all of this, as is an idea that \u201cit\u2019s complicated\u201d where what\u2019s really meant is \u201ccomplicated racism.\u201d Welfare was opened up by liberals who thought they were doing black people a favor, often at the behest of black protesters. The Rockefeller drug laws that ended up penalizing crack over powdered cocaine were supported by black Congress members.\n\nTo wonder why, oh why, whites see blacks as violent rings a little hollow at times like these.\n\nHistory is messy. But we live in the present and what poor black Baltimoreans see is abuse. The War on Drugs assigns cops to black neighborhoods where, inevitably, encounters tend to be surly and often violent. A vicious cycle starts. What a poor black Baltimorean knows in 2015, what we all know in 2015, is that something needs to change.\n\nNow, to be sure, the rioters\u2019 actions are inherently inarticulate. Certainly some of them are simply opportunists\u2014it\u2019s no accident that most of the looters are young men; pure political protest is often more diverse. The people marching in Selma included women, older people, etc. And of course the riots and looting could also end up compounding many of white Americans\u2019 ugliest stereotypes of black communities and violence. To wonder why, oh why, whites see blacks as violent rings a little hollow at times like these.\n\nBut the reflexive liberal rush to moral relativism on the subject misses the mark as well. A certain contingent will not be disabused of the idea that inner-city Baltimore is the product of racism alone, as opposed to a complex cocktail of racism in the past, misapplied benevolence afterwards, and a cyclic process of dissonance now. Their take on all of this is better at assuaging white guilt than telling us where to go from here in a real world.\n\nThat is, neither the players nor their fellow-traveling spectators are in a position to see the whole picture. Yet something positive can still come of all this.\n\nToday, regardless of the complexities of how we got here, the main thing that keeps black America feeling alienated in its own land is the police. It\u2019s what animated the Black Panthers. It\u2019s what drove an entire genre of rap, celebrated by intellectuals as poetic prophecy. It\u2019s what a black person brings up if asked why they think racism is important. It\u2019s what has driven the arc of black history since last summer.\n\nIn that light, there is a genuine conversation about the cops and black people going on these days in America, and that wouldn\u2019t be true if there hadn\u2019t been riots in Ferguson.\n\nEven if the participants\u2019 and observers\u2019 take on that episode was distorted\u2014the entire \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d narrative was ultimately proven false by the Justice Department\u2014the overall result may have started something positive. To the extent that rioting can make any kind of sense, it would have been more appropriate in the wake of Eric Garner\u2019s or John Crawford\u2019s or Tamir Rice\u2019s murders.\n\nBut history is messy. What we have is the present. And in that present, one simple thing is imperative: America must de-escalate the persistent tensions between cops and young black men. The easiest and most sensible way to do that is to interrupt the foolish War on Drugs. The gradual easing of laws against marijuana sale and purchase are a start. The tenor of black America\u2019s response to cops murdering black men should be a spur to going further.\n\nIf one generation of black men grew up without thinking of the cops as the enemy, black America would be a new place making the best of a bad hand, and we would finally start getting past the current tiresome and troubling situation.\n\nYet with the camera pulled back further, so to speak, I suspect that something constructive could still come of this mess. This is how things happen\u2014history is always messy.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:36.098+0000"}

He then saw a small tag reading:\n\n\u201cMade in Mexico.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe elder Nickol called the firm\u2019s headquarters. He was assured that the tag was genuine. He was all the more devastated that nobody had bothered to tell him that the firm was outsourcing.\n\nHe responded as an honorable man who took pride in a long-established reputation for selling good American-made jeans and was now faced with being party to sacrificing loyal American workers in the name of greed.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018Nope,\u2019\u201d the son recalls.\n\nThe father resigned and resolved that he would keep providing his loyal customers with good American-made jeans even if he had to make them himself. His son, B.J., joined him in doing just that in a barn on the family farm in the town of Arcanum.\n\n\u201cWe said, \u2018Hey, let\u2019s give it a go,\u2019\u201d the son says. \u201cIt definitely had its challenges.\u201d\n\nThey made a first pair and then a second and then a third.\n\n\u201cI think we had a little closet to put some inventory,\u201d the son says.\n\nHis mother also pitched in.\n\n\u201cIt was the three of us,\u201d the son says.\n\nFor the first two years, they made no profit at all, and they had to support themselves by working other jobs.\n\n\u201cInsurance, things like that,\u201d the son reports.\n\nThe only easy part was deciding what to call their new business.

The aptly named company also began to offer other kinds of pants, along with shorts, shirts, jackets, boots, and belts.\n\n\u201cWe pretty much got stuff to cover you from head to toe,\u201d the son says.\n\nThe company is now on the way to putting 30 people to work.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the most rewarding part, being able to provide jobs for people,\u201d the son says.\n\nAnd the All American Clothing Company could hire even more if Trump decided that the attire he peddles in his tower and online should all have a \u201cMade in USA\u201d label.\n\nHe is enough of a politician to ensure that the \u201cMake America Great\u201d hat he sells is American made.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d he told The Daily Beast the other day.\n\nBut he is also enough of a politician that his shirts continue to bear the \u201cMade in Lesotho\u201d tag. A Trump supporter might say that at least the items are not Chinese made. But in a sense, they are. Virtually all the garment factories in Lesotho are owned by Chinese and Taiwanese businessmen who shifted the manufacturing from their native countries to take advantage of the African Growth and Opportunity Act of 2000, which waived customs duties for garments imported to America from sub-Saharan Africa. And the wages in Lesotho are low even by Chinese standards.\n\nIn truth, nothing could be easier for Trump than to put his clothing labels where his mouth is and make America a little greater by ensuring that his shirts are as American made as his hats. He need only contact the All American Clothing Company, which stands ready to produce even those shirts with \u201cTrump National Golf Club\u201d on the breast.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll do some embroidery,\u201d B.J.

It just takes one senator to block these confirmations, and LeMieux, of Florida, decided to do so.\n\nHe told The Daily Beast that he held up Shannon\u2019s confirmation for two main reasons: first, because he felt the Obama administration and the State Department hadn\u2019t come down on the right side of a military coup in Honduras, and second, because the Obama administration wasn\u2019t doing enough to support human-rights activists in Cuba.\n\n\u201cThe Obama Administration and the Clinton State Department were basically on the wrong side,\u201d he said, referring to the military coup that resulted in the removal of the Honduran president.\n\n\u201cThe American government was not standing on the side of the Democratic leader, and was silent at best, and was supportive of the military regime at worst, and was completely opposite pro-Democracy countries in the hemisphere,\u201d he said. \u201cShannon was basically the person on point for that.

{"entityId": 1622, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why candidates\u2014particularly Republicans\u2014avoid selfies with voters at their peril.\n\nThe selfie may have started as a silly trend, but today it provides the portrait of a generation. And the rise of the selfie on the campaign trail highlights a rising young electorate that is turned off by phoniness and glossy perfection and is seeking to genuinely connect with candidates as real people.\n\nLast Sunday, The New York Times covered the on-the-trail phenomenon of voters trying to snap a selfie with candidates. Some, like Jeb Bush, seem generally game; others, like Ben Carson, warn that selfies are dangerous and distracting and that since the first selfie debuted (in the 1830\u2019s, no less) its all been \u201cdownhill.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe idea that this election will be \u201cthe selfie election\u201d may seem frivolous or beneath what our nation\u2019s politics should stand for, a sign of the Kardashian-ification of elections. Columnist Kathleen Parker has bemoaned the showing-off and bragging that social media has injected into politics, and Daily Caller editor Jamie Weinstein summarized his thoughts thusly: \u201cYou should only vote for a candidate who refuses to participate in a selfie as a matter of principle.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn reality, selfies are mostly a matter of speed and convenience, cutting out the need to beg someone else to take the photo. But there\u2019s something about selfie-mania that I think actually tells us a lot about how people\u2014particularly the millennial generation\u2014wants to engage in politics these days.\n\nLook to pop culture: the celebrities who have built the best online followings haven\u2019t done so with perfectly manicured photo ops, but rather with goofier, more candid pics that make fans feel connected. (My favorite of these is of Anna Kendrick, splicing two red carpet glamour shots next to a full-length photo of Kendrick in footie pajamas, captioned \u201ctruth in advertising.\u201d)\n\n\n\nThe personalities that are on the rise these days aren\u2019t the ones who appear carefully managed, constantly airbrushed, and distant; they\u2019re the ones who, like Kendrick, appear to open a genuine window into their own lives and invite fans and followers in.\n\nLook to pop culture: The celebrities who have built the best online followings haven\u2019t done so with perfectly manicured photo ops, but rather with goofier, more candid pics that make fans feel connected.\n\nAnd yet, prior to this \u201cselfie election,\u201d the photo op perfected by most politicians was the grip-and-grin: staged, repetitive, and far from personal. Anything a little rougher around the edges, less pristine and perfectly packaged, is generally eschewed. Hopefully candidates are finally recognizing the drawbacks to this approach. Take the documentary Mitt, which caught Mitt Romney in less polished moments doing things like ironing his own suit while he was wearing it; this intimate, candid, personal take on him was kept under wraps until after the election had long passed. Had it come out before, it would have helped humanize him.\n\nIt\u2019s an understatement to say today that people don\u2019t trust politicians. Poll after poll shows voters\u2014particularly young voters\u2014feel disconnected from politics and don\u2019t trust government leaders to do the right thing. They take the view that political leaders are terrible, that running for office isn\u2019t a noble pursuit, that our parties and our media aren\u2019t to be trusted. They see ads on TV or a candidate spouting well-worn talking points and tune out. They pick up on inauthenticity and recoil from it accordingly.\n\nThe selfie, for better or worse, tears down that wall, even if just for a moment. I met this person. They cared enough to take a picture with me. Politicians may live inside a bubble, but selfies let voters feel like they pierced that bubble, and particularly for young voters\u2014who are often ignored, especially by Republicans\u2014that feeling can be meaningful. And the fact that the feeling can be shared with the click of a button makes it all the more powerful.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Republicans have been particularly bad at courting disillusioned and disaffected younger voters in recent elections. In the 2012 presidential election, Mitt Romney lost the under-30 vote by a 23-point margin; this represented only a modest improvement over the 2008 blowout that John McCain suffered among young voters. With millennials on track to expand their footprint, representing at least one out of every five voters in this coming election, Republicans can\u2019t afford a similar disaster.\n\nSomeone who turns 18 next year, in time to cast a ballot in the 2016 election, has a whole lifetime of voting ahead of them. If they live into their 80s, that\u2019s voting until at least the election of 2076. And for those millennials who enter the political process thinking that Republicans operate in a totally different universe than they do, culturally and technologically, that attitude is unlikely to fade away, even as they age.\n\nWhile snapping selfies with younger voters won\u2019t entirely solve the GOP\u2019s problems with millennial voters, at least it\u2019s a start. And in contrast with the highly managed, closed off Hillary Clinton campaign, a more open, authentic, and personal candidate is just what Republicans will need in order to get a new generation to open their minds to a point of view they\u2019ve tuned out before.

And did Obama break promises when he made the Iran deal?\n\nBy Linda Qiu and Louis Jacobson\n\nDonald Trump didn\u2019t back down Sunday from comments he made a day earlier that Vietnam War POW Sen. John McCain is \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week, Trump claimed his remarks at an Iowa forum were taken out of context by Republican candidates jealous of Trump\u2019s poll numbers.\n\n\u201cFour times, I said he is a hero,\u201d Trump said told ABC\u2019s Martha Raddatz. \u201cBut you know, people choose little selective\u2014like you try to do\u2014people choose little selective pieces. If you read what I say or if you watch what I say, which is even better, you\u2019ll say that there was nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nWe took Trump up on his suggestion to watch what he said.\n\nThe truth is Trump is taking his own comments out of context. We rate his claim Mostly False.\n\nHere\u2019s the transcript of Trump talking with Republican pollster Frank Luntz, which starts with Trump responding to McCain calling some Trump Arizona supporters \u201ccrazies.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201c[McCain] insulted me and he insulted everybody in that room. And I said somebody should run against John McCain, who has been, in my opinion, not so hot. And I supported him for president. I raised $1 million for him. That\u2019s a lot of money. I supported him, he lost, he let us down. But he lost and I never liked him much after that \u2019cause I don\u2019t like losers. But, but\u2014Frank, Frank, let me get to it.\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero. He\u2019s a war hero \u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero\u2026\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cHe\u2019s war hero.\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe is a war hero\u2026\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cFive and half years in a Vietnamese prison camp\u2026\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured. So he\u2019s a war hero \u2026\u201d\n\nLuntz: \u201cDo you agree with that?\u201d\n\nTrump: \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero, because he was captured, OK? I believe, perhaps, he\u2019s a war hero. But right now he said some very bad things about a lot of people. So what I said is John McCain, I disagree with him that these people aren\u2019t crazy.\u201d\n\nTrump said McCain \u201cis a war hero\u201d five times, but always with strings attached. Twice, he was interrupted by Luntz before he could finish his sentence. Once, the statement was preceded by \u201cI believe, perhaps.\u201d And the last two times, Trump added \u201cbecause he was captured.\u201d He also, of course, started all this by saying McCain is \u201cnot a war hero.\u201d\n\nExperts told us these caveats change the meaning of the sentence entirely.\n\n\u201c\u2018He\u2019s a war hero because he was captured\u2019 implies that anybody who is captured is called a war hero, but there\u2019s really nothing special about them,\u201d said Kathleen Kendall, who studies political campaign communication at the University of Maryland.\n\nMcCain was taken prisoner by the Viet Cong when his plane was shot down in 1967. For five and a half years, he was tortured and held in solitary confinement amid attempts by the North Vietnamese to obtain information and false confessions, according to the Navy.\n\nWe\u2019re not exploring whether captivity is a marker of heroism, but Trump likely wasn\u2019t, either, says rhetoric scholar Paul Achter of the University of Richmond.\n\n\u201c[Trump] appears to have thought it would be a funny aside to the question he was answering,\u201d Achter said.\n\nIn short, Trump\u2019s self-defense is flimsy at best. As for his accusation of critics cherry-picking his comments, experts say the pot is calling the kettle black.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s taking his own words out of context. That\u2019s the offense he\u2019s charging the media with,\u201d Kendall said.\n\nWhile Trump and his antics continued to take up much of the political airspace Sunday, plenty was also made of the historic agreement reached between the Obama administration and Iran.\n\nCritics had much to say about the proposed nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cThis deal violates promises the president made to the American people on multiple fronts,\u201d 2016 presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said on CNN. \u201cIt is not an anytime, anywhere inspection system. It is an inspection process that will require arbitration over a 24-day period or longer that Iran can fight against and delay things.\u201d\n\nRubio\u2019s claim that the Iran deal \u201cviolates promises the president made to the American people\u201d because \u201cit is not an anytime, anywhere inspection process\u201d rates Half True.\n\nWhat\u2019s correct in Rubio\u2019s statement is that the proposed deal with Iran does not include anytime, anywhere inspections.\n\nAt an Iranian facility like Natanz, where more than 5,000 centrifuges will be operating, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) will have cameras that provide 24-hour monitoring, said Matthew Bunn, a nuclear specialist at the Harvard Kennedy School. In addition, the agreement says, \u201cIran will permit the IAEA regular access, including daily access as requested by the IAEA, to relevant buildings at [the Iranian nuclear facility at] Natanz...for 15 years.\u201d\n\nHowever, this sort of 24/7 surveillance will not be the rule everywhere in the Iranian nuclear archipelago.\n\n\u201cAt most locations, inspections will be every once in a while, on a schedule the inspectors judge to be sufficient based on the sensitivity of the activities at that location, how long it would take for Iran to do something there that would make a difference, and so on,\u201d Bunn said.\n\nAnd as Rubio said, even if Iran ultimately agrees to a contentious inspection, the wait could be as long as 24 days.\n\nWhat\u2019s less clear is Rubio\u2019s claim that anytime, anywhere inspections were an Obama promise.\n\nA top Obama adviser, Ben Rhodes, twice described the deal as granting \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d access.\n\nBut all the other descriptions provided by Rhodes, White House press secretary Josh Earnest, and President Obama were more nuanced. Those descriptions talked about a robust and intrusive inspection program but not anytime, anywhere.\n\nHere\u2019s how Obama put it in April: \u201cIran will face strict limitations on its program, and Iran has also agreed to the most robust and intrusive inspections and transparency regime ever negotiated for any nuclear program in history\u2026International inspectors will have unprecedented access not only to Iranian nuclear facilities but to the entire supply chain that supports Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d\n\nThat phrasing was much more common in Obama administration descriptions of the deal and paints Obama\u2019s promise in a different light.\n\nAaron Sharockman contributed to this report.

Who shined (Rubio), seemed sane (Kasich), and...Trumped.\n\nIt was a debate unlike any other.\n\nThe GOP turned into the WWE\u2014the first presidential contest that seemed to consciously imitate reality television. It was almost certainly the first presidential debate to include an explicit blowjob reference.\n\nAt the center of it all was The Donald.\n\nTen people were on the stage. Nine of them were running for president, with the man in the middle, the undisputed leader in the polls, still acting like an insult comic. While Trump didn\u2019t dominate the debate as expected, he did his best to keep the substance to a minimum.\n\nHis performance was true to form\u2014somehow both shocking and totally predictable. Early on, he botched a question from Megyn Kelly about his previous statements on women.\n\n\u201cYou call women you don\u2019t like \u2018fat pigs,\u2019 \u2018dogs,\u2019 \u2018slobs,\u2019 and \u2018disgusting animals,\u2019\u201d Kelly said.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just Rosie O\u2019Donnell,\u201d Trump retorted, drawing whoops and cheers from the crowd.\n\nKelly continued, saying his comments were directed to women \u201cwell beyond Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a great picture to see her on her knees,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cDoes that sound to you like the temperament of the man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton, who is likely to be the Democratic nominee, that you are part of the war on women?\u201d\n\nTrump defended those slurs by suggesting everyone else had just become too sensitive.\n\n\u201cI think the big problem this country has is being politically correct,\u201d he said.\n\nOf course.\n\nMeanwhile, the nine other candidates\u2014you know, the ones who might actually become the Republican nominee\u2014achieved various degrees of adequacy.\n\nGov. Scott Walker was milquetoast; Sen. Marco Rubio shined. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush survived; Gov. John Kasich, benefiting greatly from the hometown crowd, seemed sane, sincere, serious, and\u2014when it came to his answer on gay marriage, at least\u2014kind.\n\nA newcomer to the top tier, the Ohio governor had perhaps one of the most interesting and revealing moments of the debate. Pressed on his stance on same-sex marriage and how he would explain to one of his children his objection to it if one of them were gay, he said he had just attended the marriage of one of his gay friends. The remark was met by immediate and loud applause from attendees.\n\nKasich then put his attendance at the wedding in an explicitly religious context: He was old-fashioned, sure, but God had given him unconditional love, and that\u2019s the same kind of love he would show his children.\n\nOf course, not everyone had a big moment.\n\nSome of the other candidates\u2014Sen. Ted Cruz, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee\u2014showed up and were largely well-placed spectators, save for maybe a good one-liner or two.\n\nSen. Rand Paul came off as the heel\u2014the arrogant one, too aggressive, the one you root against. Weirdly enough, this is a role Trump has actually played in a WWE match.\n\nThe Kentucky senator came into the debate hot and within minutes was trying to take on Trump.\n\nBret Baier, one of the three moderators of the debate, asked the candidates to raise their hand if they were unwilling to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s orange-hued hand went up, Paul pounced.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s already hedging his bets because he\u2019s used to buying politicians!\u201d the senator yelled.\n\nLater, after Paul attacked Trump again during a conversation about a single payer health care system, Trump calmly said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you heard me. You are not having a good night.\u201d\n\nAnd for a guy so opposed to war, Paul was certainly was the most belligerent one on the stage.\n\nDuring one heated exchange over government surveillance, Paul and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie screamed over each other until the moderators, mercifully, intervened.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again\u2014\u201d Paul spat.\n\nChristie retorted, \u201cYou know, Senator Paul, you know the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people in September 11.\u201d\n\nMoving right along, Walker, an early favorite in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, may have had his strongest moment when he was questioned about cybersecurity, joking that China and Russia know more about Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server than Congress does.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the Wisconsin governor was \u201caggressively normal,\u201d as he described himself in his closing statement. Not bad, really, just... not great.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think you heard me. You are not having a good night.\u201d\n\nAnd not everyone came there to throw down. In fact, after the early joists and apart from Paul\u2019s continued poking at Christie and Trump, it all became rather calm and\u2014dare we say it\u2014somehow serious.\n\nBush and Rubio kept it, in the oft-used words of the GOP frontrunner, \u201cclassy.\u201d\n\nWhile Rubio spoke about immigration, education, and abortion, he scored no significant hits against his opponents. Even as the moderators tried to pit him against fellow Floridian Bush, Rubio chose not to confront him and instead carefully criticized him on policy on issues like Common Core.\n\nBoth Rubio and Bush faced tough questions on their abortion records.\n\nKelly prodded Bush for serving on the board of the Bloomberg Family Foundation, which gives significant financial backing to Planned Parenthood.\n\nBush replied by laying out a laundry list of pro-life policy changes he\u2019d implemented as Florida governor and said he had no idea the Bloomberg Foundation was sending any of that money to Planned Parenthood.\n\nRubio was asked about his support for legislation that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, with exemptions for rape, incest, and concerns about the life of the mother. He dodged the rape and incest question when challenged by Kelly, who noted that Timothy Dolan, the Catholic cardinal of New York, has described such exemptions as a cop-out.\n\nSome of Rubio\u2019s strongest remarks came as he discussed his financial struggles and those of his parents.\n\nThe Florida Republican spoke passionately about his personal understanding of what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck and to be burdened by student loans. He juxtaposed that background with the Clintons and their enormous wealth: He\u2019s not Hillary, he\u2019s you.\n\n\u201c[T]his election cannot be a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 competition. It\u2019s important to be qualified, but if this election is a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 competition, then Hillary Clinton\u2019s gonna be the next president, because she\u2019s been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cThis election better be about the future, not the past. It better be about the issues our nation and the world is facing today, not simply the issues we once faced.\u201d\n\nIt was a debate we\u2019d never seen before; ridiculous at times, substantive at others, with a crowd that ate it all up like they were watching America\u2019s Got Talent. And despite Paul\u2019s bluster, Trump\u2019s\u2026 Trump-ness, and the relative quietness of some of the other top-tier candidates, no one ended their run Thursday night.\n\nAnd that\u2019s good news.

{"entityId": 1625, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Sorry, folks, Trump isn\u2019t going to fade away any time soon, and will likely still be a major force at the convention.\n\nDonald Trump is keeping a lot of people up at night. And they are wrestling with scenarios about how and when he is going to fade or go away. The problem is they are leaning on history and conventional wisdom as their crutch. And Trump is turning out to be a crutch kicker.\n\nDonald Trump is not going away any time soon. In fact, he may be here to stay. Here\u2019s why.\n\nVoters have become completely disillusioned with politics because they have been let down so many times.\n\nThey don\u2019t believe a word any politician says anymore. And they don\u2019t really care what the outcome of the elections are because they don\u2019t think anyone will keep their word anyway. Voters are at the Network threshold: They\u2019re mad as hell, and they\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\n\nSo what better way to express their disgust with the system than to take a very large and sharp stick and poke it in the eye of the body politic. And that stick is Donald Trump.\n\nIf there is one thing Donald Trump amplifies and exemplifies more than anyone imaginable, it is utter contempt for the establishment status quo.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s support strengthened after the first debate, contrary to what many thought would happen, including me, that\u2019s when I knew we were in new territory. But, it also reminded me of what we always believed during the Bush campaigns: attributes are more important than issues, and the most important attribute is perception of being a strong leader (followed by trust and shared values).\n\nSo who or what is going to take Trump down?\n\nUnlike other candidates who, in recent years, pushed to the top of polls but then faded because they just didn\u2019t have the money to sustain their flight, Trump can stay in the air refueling forever.\n\nJeb Bush and Carly Fiorina are throwing some roundhouse punches. And presumably, a crushing weight of Super PAC attack ads will start falling on Trump.\n\nSure, the collective beating up will have an impact. Ben Carson may win Iowa. Some other candidate may win New Hampshire. But the reality is that there are a large percentage of voters out there who don\u2019t care that Donald Trump hasn\u2019t been, or isn\u2019t, a solid and consistent conservative.\n\nThey don\u2019t even care that they themselves don\u2019t agree with some of his positions. These voters are still going to see Trump as the guy with the big brass clankers who is brash and independent enough\u2014self-funding and therefore not relying on any special interest money\u2014that he is the one and only guy who will create real heartburn for the status quo.\n\nAnd Trump has money to burn. So unlike other candidates who, in recent years, pushed to the top of polls but then faded because they just didn\u2019t have the money to sustain their flight, Trump can stay in the air refueling forever.\n\nSo what\u2019s going to happen?\n\nSmart people like Bill Clinton, Stuart Stevens, and Nate Silver believe Trump will flame out. And that could very well happen. As Silver points out, history suggests an eventual demise for Trump.\n\nBut that\u2019s the thing about politics: Conventional wisdom gets thrown out the door all the time. And has there ever been a more unconventional presidential candidate than Trump? The weakness of the \u201cTrump fades\u201d theory is that that would mean the voters supporting Trump get un-mad. Or, they find someone else who channels their anger better than Trump, though it\u2019s hard to imagine who that could be.\n\nSo I think it\u2019s possible voters have hit their pain threshold and will generate enough heat to keep the Trump flame burning for a long time. More likely than not, Trump actually does go the distance, probably not getting the nomination, but gathering enough delegates that he has to be reckoned with at the convention.\n\nOr, how about this wild scenario: Trump actually starts to get enough delegates to win the nomination. Then, irony of ironies, rather than Trump running as a third party, the GOP establishment decides to pull a Roosevelt, and re-creates the Republican Party under an independent banner.\n\nAnd (1) because all the candidates currently running pledged at the main-stage debate to support the nominee of the GOP (though certainly not binding), and (2) because it would difficult and messy to choose among the Republicans running, and (3) because those running would be out of money, the obvious choice to step in and save the day as the independent candidate would be\u2014drum roll\u2014Mitt Romney.\n\nBottom line, one way or the other, at the end of this election, there will likely be a Trump factor that affects the outcome. Because he\u2019s waving the one-finger salute at Washington at a time when that is exactly the message much of America wants to send.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:39.043+0000"}

PunditFact calls them on it.\n\nBy Jon Greenberg and Katie Sanders\n\nWith Hillary Clinton making her presidential run official, Republicans from Mitt Romney to Kentucky Senator Rand Paul jumped at the chance Sunday to revisit Clinton\u2019s biggest controversies from her tenure as secretary of state.\n\nWe fact-checked claims from both Republicans.\n\nWe\u2019ll take Romney first. On Fox News Sunday, Romney said Clinton deleted emails that were subject to review by Congress.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen in polls and in discussions across the country a feeling that Hillary Clinton is just not trustworthy,\u201d Romney said on Fox News Sunday. \u201cThis whole story about her having erased all of her emails even though they were subject to recall and review by Congress, I think that\u2019s made people remember that with the Clintons it\u2019s always something.\u201d\n\nThat claim rates Mostly False.\n\nRomney\u2019s claim contains two errors. First, Clinton did not erase all her emails.\n\nIn March, the public learned that instead of using a State Department email account when she was in charge, Clinton conducted email through a private server in her New York home. When State Department officials asked for copies of her government-related emails late last year, Clinton\u2019s staff went through her files and sent over about 30,000 emails. According to Clinton, about an equal number of emails were judged to be personal and were erased.\n\nRomney\u2019s second mistake is using the phrase \u201crecall and review by Congress.\u201d\n\nCongress plays no role at all in deciding what materials should be preserved when an official leaves office, said Jason R. Baron, a lawyer at Drinker Biddle and Reath and a former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration.\n\n\u201cThis is an executive branch function,\u201d Baron said. \u201cIn most agencies when a senior official leaves, there is a protocol to review the documents that the official might have. The Federal Records Act doesn\u2019t expect Congress to review anything.\u201d\n\nCongress does have the right to subpoena records as part of an investigation, and congressional committees have been investigating the deaths at the American compound in Benghazi, Libya. This might be what Romney had in mind. But if he did, that makes his point even harder to prove.\n\n\u201cClinton has stated that she turned over to the State Department any records responsive to congressional subpoena at the time,\u201d said Douglas Cox, a law professor who specializes in government records law at the City University of New York. \u201cAn allegation that she destroyed records subject to subpoena is a serious one, and it is speculative absent more specific evidence.\u201d\n\nPaul, meanwhile, was asked on CNN for an example of Clinton being successful as secretary of state. He answered by pointing out her failure in Libya.\n\n\u201cI think really that the issue in Benghazi is an enormous issue because it\u2019s the one, as commander-in-chief, she would be there for the 3 a.m. phone call. I think Benghazi was a 3 a.m. phone call that she never picked up,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\u201cShe didn\u2019t\u2014she didn\u2019t provide the security, not just that day, for nine months. Dozens and dozens of requests for more security, all completely ignored by Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nThat claim rates Half True.\n\nPaul\u2019s claim that Clinton herself ignored a litany of security requests for the Benghazi outpost does not completely check out, though it is true that the U.S. diplomats in Libya had warned of insufficient protection and the deteriorating climate in eastern Libya in the months ahead of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens\u2019s death.\n\nThe accuracy of his claim comes down to this: There is no hard proof that Clinton \u201ccompletely ignored\u201d \u201cdozens and dozens\u201d of requests for more staffing.\n\nStill, there is smoke.\n\nClinton\u2019s reason for not responding to requests from U.S. diplomats in Libya outlining the need for enhanced security staffing was simple: The requests did not make it up to her through the chain of command, she has said.\n\nTo critics like Paul, Clinton assumes responsibility for what went wrong during her four years at secretary of state regardless of whether she was informed.\n\n\u201cDid the State Department, under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton\u2019s leadership, deny the request for additional security? The answer is yes,\u201d said Paul spokesman Eleanor May.\n\nExperts say we may never know what Clinton knew about the security shortfalls in Benghazi, which officials envisioned as a temporary outpost to monitor eastern Libya\u2019s nation-building efforts after the collapse of the Muammar Gadhafi regime.\n\nPaul may also be overstating by saying there were dozens and dozens of requests for security, experts told us. We found several examples, but not as many as Paul suggested Sunday.\n\n\u201cI would be suspect of anyone making firm conclusions one way or another,\u201d said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist and expert in Middle Eastern affairs at the RAND Corporation.\n\nAaron Sharockman contributed to this report.

Cheaper housing, more jobs, and lower taxes,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAnd Ian McDonald, a political scientist at Oregon\u2019s Lewis & Clark College, told NPR in 2013 that those moves can make a mark.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to change Texas politics immediately, but all of the inbound migration to Texas is making Texas more liberal than it otherwise would be,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd now, Huckabee et. al. worry New Yorkers will take those same liberal voting proclivities to Florida.\n\nIf that demographic change plays out, the Empire State emigrants could have a far more substantial impact on Florida than Californians are having on Texas. That\u2019s simply because Florida is way\u2014way, way, way\u2014more purple than the Lone Star State, and Republicans win there by far tinier margins.\n\nIn fact, Republicans\u2019 electoral good fortunes there have been due largely to the state party\u2019s ability to outperform the odds. Despite the fact that the state voted for Obama in both 2012 and 2008, Republicans control both chambers of the state legislature, as well as the governorship, the lieutenant governorship, and the attorney general\u2019s office.\n\nDemographic trends, including immigration from foreign countries and from blue states like New York, could make it harder and harder for the GOP to maintain its remarkably effective clout in the state.

The early evidence is pretty clear.\n\nSo, Hillary\u2019s taken a few questions from the press now. But something more interesting than that has been happening over the past month: She has moved to the left or signaled her intention to do so on a pretty broad range of issues. All of you who want Elizabeth Warren in the race? Chill, people. She practically is.\n\nNow, for all I know it might make the Clinton people cringe to see me write that, because it surely provides some degree of ammo for the right. But I reckon the right would have noticed this without my intervention, so my conscience is clear. But this is the emerging reality: If you are a 40-something Democrat who has voted over the years for Bill Clinton and Al Gore and John Kerry and Barack Obama, it\u2019s looking like you are about to cast a vote next year for the most liberal Democratic nominee of your voting lifetime.\n\nStart with the two positions she\u2019s taken since the announcement video that have probably gotten the most attention. Her immigration position is considerably more aggressive than Obama\u2019s, expanding his executive actions to allow more people to obtain work permits. Then, on prisons, she famously called for the end of the era of mass incarceration. The speech was filled with pleas to get low-level and nonviolent offenders out of prison and with sentences like \u201cthere is something wrong when a third of all black men face the prospect of prison during their lifetimes.\u201d\n\nIf you are a 40-something Democrat who has voted over the years for Bill Clinton and Al Gore and John Kerry and Barack Obama, it\u2019s looking like you are about to cast a vote next year for the most liberal Democratic nominee of your voting lifetime.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot more where that came from, usually announced, or mentioned, in those meetings with voters that the press following her so loathe. Here are the four most notable ones. These aren\u2019t fully fleshed-out policy proposals, but presumably those will come:\n\n\u2022 She told an audience in Keene, New Hampshire, that the country needs a free and universal pre-kindergarten program.\n\n\u2022 At Tina Brown\u2019s Women in the World summit in New York, she called for greatly expanded after-school and child-care programs.\n\n\u2022 Also in Keene, she came out for closing the carried-interest loophole for hedge-fund managers, and the rhetoric was pretty populist, as she told furniture workers: \u201cYou are in the production of goods, and I want to do everything I can to support goods and real services and take a hard look at what is now being done in the trading world, which is just trading for the sake of trading. And it\u2019s just wrong that a hedge fund manager pays a lower tax rate than a nurse or a trucker or an assembly worker here at Whitney Brothers.\u201d\n\n\u2022 And most important from my personal point of view, she\u2019s been speaking out strongly in favor of paid family and medical leave, saying to a questioner at a Norwalk, Iowa, roundtable: \u201cWell, boy, you are right on my wavelength because, look, we are the last developed country in the world that has no national paid leave for parenting, for illness. And what we know from the few states that have done it\u2014California being most notable here\u2014is it builds loyalty. If you really analyzed turnover in a lot of businesses where you have to retrain somebody\u2014well, first you have to find them and then you have to retrain them\u2014making your employees feel that you care about these milestones in their lives and you give them the chance to have a child, adopt a child, recover from a serious illness, take care of a really sick parent and get a period of time that\u2019s paid just cements that relationship.\u201d\n\nThese six positions\u2014along with her support for a much higher minimum wage that\u2019s indexed to inflation\u2014almost by themselves make Clinton the most on-paper progressive candidate (and putative nominee) since who knows when. She is saying things that one never thought the Hillary Clinton of 10 or 20 years ago would have said.\n\nIt may be true that it\u2019s less that she\u2019s changed than that the times have, and she\u2019s adapting. But hey, give her credit for adapting. Last summer, during her book tour, she said she didn\u2019t think paid family leave was possible. Now, she\u2019s talking like someone who isn\u2019t merely describing a crappy reality but someone who sees that the point is to change it.\n\nThere are some important positions she hasn\u2019t taken yet. On the TPP trade agreement, most obviously, which is one on which I think she might go against the left, although I\u2019m just guessing. I want to see what she has to say down the road about entitlements. Something tells me, the way she\u2019s been talking so far, that there won\u2019t be much emphasis on grand bargains and being responsible and raising the retirement age. I\u2019ll be curious to see, for example, whether she endorses raising the payroll tax cap. I went to see West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin speak at Brookings the other day, and he said he\u2019d gladly support raising the cap to help fix the entitlements\u2019 insolvency problems. If Joe can say it, can Hillary?\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I wrote a column urging liberals to suck it up and accept the fact that Hillary Clinton was the choice and there\u2019s too much at stake and there\u2019s nothing else to do so just get over it and support her. That column didn\u2019t say much about her positions. It was just about the Supreme Court and what a nightmare Republican rule would be.\n\nBut at the rate she\u2019s going, very little sucking it up will be required. She\u2019s turning into a bona fide progressive. She may not go for the class-warfare rhetorical jugular with quite Warren\u2019s gusto. But \u201cthe top 25 hedge-fund managers together make more money than all the kindergarten teachers in America,\u201d which she said this week in Iowa, is close enough for me, and a lot closer than I thought she was going to be at this stage.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:39.613+0000"}

They\u2019ll all matter a lot less than the economy come 2016.\n\nThanks to Donald Trump, everyone\u2019s favorite reality star, we\u2019re seeing 2008 Republican nominee John McCain\u2019s name in the headlines again. And recollection of what happened in that election is timely, and indeed beneficial, for all of us.\n\n2008 holds two important lessons with regard to 2016 that many presidential candidates are missing: General elections are rarely about what campaigns expect them to be about, and\u2014to borrow a turn of phrase from British soldiers\u2014prior planning prevents pretty piss poor performance.\n\nRemember how the 2008 election was supposed to be all about Iraq? The whole way through the primaries, discussion of that war-torn country and our role there dominated the discussion. Then-Senator Clinton got hammered 24-7 for having voted for the Iraq War, and for refusing to apologize. Then-Senator Obama was attractive to many Democratic primary voters first and foremost because of his stance on Iraq.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Republican field, John McCain ran on the idea of a troop surge in Iraq, openly and readily discussing the possibility of a very long-term presence in the country. Mitt Romney garnered at least a few raised eyebrows with his more withdrawal-happy commentary, and his implicit assertion that a private equity genius would better manage U.S. engagement in Iraq than a certified war hero.\n\nObama and McCain won; Clinton and Romney lost\u2014because, don\u2019t you know, Iraq was what 2008 was all about.\n\nExcept that it wasn\u2019t. As it turned out, 2008 was about a financial meltdown. Voters had to choose between a newbie senator who cultivated an appearance throughout the drama of at least being able to walk and chew gum at the same time, and a national security-oriented leader who, while widely respected, failed to inspire confidence when the financial sector went into freefall.\n\n2016 could easily play out the same way, and candidates should remember the example of 2008 as they proceed with crafting their agendas, seeking out briefings from experts in diverse areas of policy, and campaigning across the country.\n\nRight now, national security topics appear white hot. The Iran deal is in sharp focus, with an apparent deep divide between the administration and Congress. Hillary Clinton is kinda-sorta praising the deal, while several of the Republicans are showing off their hawkish bonafides by promising to nix the deal immediately upon assumption of office. (This itself is an interesting counterpoint to then-candidate Obama\u2019s 2008 pledge to personally meet with the Iranian president during his first year in office, with no preconditions). ISIS, of course, remains a major topic in the news as well.\n\nAnd thanks to Trump, immigration\u2014or at least Trump\u2019s bombastic comments about immigrants\u2014is in the news a bit, too, with several GOP candidates looking to brandish their restrictionist credentials to appeal to the GOP base.\n\nBut there\u2019s a good chance that the 2016 general election, and maybe even the respective primaries, will not be about any of these things (and in any event, let me tell you right now that this election will not be about immigration).\n\nOut there, just beyond the horizon, serious economic challenges appear to be looming. And if they don\u2019t come to the fore by November 2016, they will certainly confront whichever candidate prevails in that contest.\n\nAvoiding driving into a large pothole is not the same thing as flying\u2014something a lot of ordinary American breadwinners would probably tell candidates and policy experts if given the chance.\n\nSome would argue that economic and fiscal issues have not really reduced in importance, or truly faded into the background. This is certainly true for hard-core economic policy wonks, debt-and-deficit haters, and\u2014yes\u2014a lot of average Americans who continue to feel that no matter what the economic data says, their financial circumstances are not improving, or not improving enough. For these voters, the American Dream itself seems in jeopardy.\n\nAnd all this could, of course, get a lot worse. As The Economist noted last month, \u201cthe global economy still faces all manner of hazards\u201d and \u201cfew economies have ever gone as long as a decade without tipping into recession\u2014America\u2019s started growing in 2009.\u201d The best-case scenario is that we have a couple more years before it gets really bad again; the worst-case scenario is that it gets bad sooner, potentially even before we get to November 2016, and that the resources that might typically be deployed to stave off a recession will have been depleted trying to deal with the last one.\n\nThis is, ironically, more possible if there is too much, or too rapid, wage growth; that kind of thing often takes a toll on earnings and corporate value. Earnings announced this month beat expectations, but expectations were also so low that it would have been hard not to beat them. So we may have something of an economic mirage going on here. Avoiding driving into a large pothole is not the same thing as flying\u2014something a lot of ordinary American breadwinners would probably tell candidates and policy experts if given the chance.\n\nIf earnings are not in great shape\u2014estimates beaten or not\u2014that could, of course, contribute to another looming problem, one that has previously been predicted: a rising federal budget deficit. Currently, it sits at nearly as low a level as it did back in June 2008; however, that is not due to any real spending restraint, just better profits and hence more tax revenue paid.\n\nAnd lest anyone forget, just about everyone in Washington, D.C., wants to drive spending higher. President Obama wants to boost both domestic and defense spending, and say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to the restraint measures put in place via the sequester.\n\nRepublicans, who like to pretend we are all for fiscal restraint but typically are just for somewhat less spending than Democrats, want to keep the caps on the domestic side, but raise defense spending. The bottom line: Spending is going to go up, while there\u2019s a good chance that revenue is going to go down (and this is setting aside any real discussion of entitlements).\n\nThat means a bigger deficit, which of course was one of the driving forces behind the first few years of the Tea Party.\n\nThis collectively means that while candidates\u2014or perhaps more accurately, their advisers\u2014may want to focus 100 percent or at least 75 percent of their time talking about Iran, ISIS, what percentage of Mexican immigrants are here to kill people, or any of the other current hot topics, they need to be formulating and at least getting prepared to talk about economic policy.\n\nThis is not because they will definitely have to switch gears to be all economy, all the time, out on the trail, but rather because they might have to. And because if they are elected, history being what it is, and economic cycles being what they are, they almost certainly will have to fix an array of economic problems that are currently out-of-sight, and out-of-mind.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:39.759+0000"}

Now they call for its dismemberment, which is a) dumb and b) will never happen.\n\nEvery so often\u2014okay, not very often actually, but more often than I hunt, or \u201ctake\u201d (what a verb!), lions\u2014I feel a little wistful about the Republican Party we all once knew. And that feeling is never stronger than when I reflect on the history of Medicare and Medicaid, which I spent part of yesterday doing, what with it being the 50th anniversary of the passage of the bill and all.\n\nLyndon Johnson went into the 1964 election knowing that he wanted to pass a universal health-care bill. He figured he couldn\u2019t get full-bore socialized medicine, so he settled on socialized medicine for old people, reckoning that was a winner. Immediately upon winning election, he directed aides to get cracking, saying as I recall something to the effect that he was going to lose a little political capital every day, so the sooner the better.\n\nIt was big and messy and complicated, just like Obamacare, and frankly, Johnson lied about the cost, back in those pre-Congressional Budget Office days. But it passed, and it passed in a way that wasn\u2019t just like Obamacare at all. Thirteen Republican senators voted for it, and 17 against; and in the House, 70 Republicans supported it, while 68 voted no. In other words, almost exactly half of all voting congressional Republicans, 83 out of 168, voted for the program that Ronald Reagan at the time was warning heralded the arrival of Marxism on our shores.\n\nPretty different GOP, eh? Well, now check out the numbers from 1983. This was, to be sure, more of a compromise piece of legislation. The Social Security Trust fund was in trouble at the time, so the 1983 amendments raised the payroll tax while increasing the retirement age to 67 for those born in 1960 or after, with the new revenue going to Medicare and Social Security. And of course you had a Republican president then, and not just any Republican president; so if Ronald Reagan was okay with a tax increase, they were, too. It passed both chambers overwhelmingly; House Republicans backed the 1983 changes 97-69, while Republican senators supported them by 47-6. (PDF)\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s worth recalling all this on the anniversary of this great law because soon enough, we\u2019re going to start hearing the usual attacks on Medicare. Wait, did I say soon enough? We already are! And not from the wingnut caucus. It was the, uh, moderate, Jeb Bush, who said just last week that Medicare is \u201can actuarially unsound system\u201d and that \u201cwe need to figure out a way to phase out this program.\u201d\n\nAll right. Now I\u2019ll grant that times have changed since 1965 and 1983, and that we\u2019re going to see all those Baby Boomers retire in the coming years. But let\u2019s be clear about a central fact. The Medicare Trust Fund is not in big trouble right now. A few years ago, it was; there were desperate predictions that it was going to go broke in five years, three. I remember 2017 being mentioned as the ominous year, and 2017 is pretty close.\n\nThe way Medicare works is so complicated and so embedded into our national life that the disruptions to doctors and hospitals and service providers of all kinds would be horrific.\n\nBut that has changed. Now, the experts say Medicare is stable until 2030. Now 2030 isn\u2019t infinity and beyond, but it\u2019s not tomorrow either. The crisis has eased, and it has eased considerably.\n\nWhat changed? Some of the reasons are just too wonky for me to go into with you in any detail, having to do with things like new strategies to reduce preventable hospital admissions. But another seems to be\u2026wait for it\u2026Obamacare. Ever since the passage of the Affordable Care Act, per-enrollee Medicare costs have decreased a little and are rising more slowly than overall health-care costs, and somehow or another the Medicare trustees have added 13 years to the program\u2019s solvency.\n\nIn fact, let\u2019s go mildly wonky here. This is worth knowing. Before the ACA passed, projections of Medicare bankruptcy were pegged, as noted, at 2017. Then shortly after the ACA became law, that was pushed to 2024. Then in 2013, it was nudged to 2026. Now it\u2019s at 2030. See a pattern here? The main reason is simple: Overall spending is lower. You might remember Mitt Romney\u2019s famous attacks on Obama for cutting $716 billion from Medicare, which took some cheek given that a) Republicans\u2019 own projected cuts under Paul Ryan\u2019s budget were far more severe and b) Ryan and other Republicans used the same budgetary assumptions Obama used for all their Medicare \u201creform\u201d plans.\n\nJust remember all this, will you, as you hear more from the Republicans on this topic. They are all going to say: Medicare is a disaster; it\u2019s broke; Obamacare has made it far worse. They\u2019ll say things that one can hardly believe can be said a person we\u2019re allegedly supposed to be taking seriously, like Marco Rubio\u2019s amazing comment that Social Security and Medicare \u201cweakened us as a people.\u201d\n\nNone of what they say will be true. But they\u2019ll say it and say it, and the conservative media will repeat it and repeat it, and we\u2019ll be in that \u201cno, the sky is green and the grass is blue\u201d territory that we know so well. And of course, their \u201creform\u201d plans are, aside from being just mean, a total fantasy. The way Medicare works is so complicated and so embedded into our national life that the disruptions to doctors and hospitals and service providers of all kinds would be horrific. Only rich people, who don\u2019t really need Medicare, and ideologues, who despise it, think you can do this. They might as well propose rerouting every single Interstate highway in America.\n\nBut most of all, it doesn\u2019t need changing. Or actually it does, but in the direction of being expanded, as Bernie Sanders says. That\u2019s probably not in the cards for the foreseeable future, although it will certainly come one day, perhaps by the time of Medicare\u2019s own 65th birthday, when the people will surely be due for another \u201cweakening.\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:40.053+0000"}

The rest are either opposed or undeclared. Has this famously entrepreneurial, outward-looking and future-oriented state suddenly caught the protectionist virus?\n\nNot likely. It\u2019s true that trade has become a tough issue for Democrats in recent decades as California has become more liberal. But the White House did manage to muster double-digit support among House Democrats there for pacts with Korea and Panama. The paucity of support this time may reflect Obama\u2019s declining clout, but it\u2019s also a testament to the success of a ham-fisted campaign of political intimidation spearheaded by organized labor.\n\nIn a raw display of financial muscle, the AFL-CIO has frozen all contributions to Democrats until after the TPA vote. Not only that, but labor and anti-trade \u201cprogressives\u201d promise to spend lavishly on primary challenges to defeat Democrats, and if that doesn\u2019t work, to spend more against them in the general election\u2014to the benefit of Republicans.\n\nRemember that the next time you hear progressives bemoaning the sinister power of money in American politics. It\u2019s insidious all right, but it\u2019s hardly confined to the Koch brothers and right-wing super PACs.\n\nOrganized labor has organized protests in Representative Bera\u2019s district, launched an ad buy slamming him for betraying \u201cworking people\u201d and taken out mock want ads for a replacement. The intrepid Bera, however, is unbowed: \u201cReally what they\u2019re trying to do is bully me into something that\u2019s wrong for my district.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, other California Democrats seem less inclined to stand up for the economic interests of their districts and state.\n\nCalifornia, after all, is the nation\u2019s leading exporter of computer and electronic equipment, and a major exporter of software and high-tech services. Yet Democrats representing Silicon Valley and San Francisco haven\u2019t come out for TPA, which Obama says is essential to negotiating a Trans-Pacific Partnership with 11 countries that account for 40 percent of global commerce.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not all high tech: The state also is a major exporter of manufacturing goods and is America\u2019s leading exporter of agricultural products.\n\nThe rise of protectionist sentiment on the left\u2014now rebranded more fashionably as \u201cpopulism\u201d\u2014is a big problem for Democrats.\n\nAll of which raises an interesting question: Are California\u2019s tech companies, farmers, wine producers and transport equipment manufacturers\u2014not to mention the state\u2019s 4.7 million trade-dependent workers\u2014paying attention to how their congressional representatives plan to vote? Maybe they should, along with more than 72,000 small enterprises (with fewer than 500 employees) that also trade in global markets.\n\nThe rise of protectionist sentiment on the left\u2014now rebranded more fashionably as \u201cpopulism\u201d\u2014is a big problem for Democrats. It threatens to taint the party with mindless business bashing, a reactionary stance toward economic progress, and nostalgia for the industrial landscape of the 1970s. None of this will help Democrats seize the high ground of jobs, innovation and growth in 2016.\n\nAs Obama often points out, blocking new trade agreements won\u2019t freeze trade or throw globalization into reverse. It will deprive Washington of the ability to set fair and liberal rules for international trade\u2014including strong labor and human-rights and environmental protections\u2014while making it harder for America to tap into an Asian-Pacific economy that will add billions of new middle-class consumers in coming decades.\n\nLabor\u2019s fratricidal campaign against pro-growth progressives couldn\u2019t come at a worse time. Republican sweeps in 2010 and 2014 have consolidated the GOP\u2019s hold on Congress, especially the House of Representatives. A string of divisive primary challenges aimed at punishing pro-trade Democrats will elect more Republicans, especially in places less deeply \u201cblue\u201d than California.\n\nInstead of trying to create a left-wing version of the Tea Party, populists would be wise to leave House Democrats free to vote their conscience and their districts. According to Pew Research, a solid majority of Democrats (58 percent) think free-trade agreements are good for the United States.\n\nAnd such attitudes are likely to persist, since millennials (69 percent) and Hispanics (71 percent) are particularly supportive of trade deals. What labor and other anti-trade activists are really doing is driving a wedge into the heart of the progressive coalition.\n\nFinally, labor does itself no favors by making trade a political loyalty test for Democrats. On the contrary, it seems bent on confirming the worst stereotype of unions as a retrograde force in American life. Labor\u2019s claims to be channeling the just demands of \u201cworking people\u201d ring hollow at a time when less than 8 percent of the private U.S. workforce belongs to unions.\n\nIt\u2019s sad to see U.S. unions wasting their waning power on a doomed crusade to protect yesterday\u2019s jobs at the expense of tomorrow\u2019s. If labor really wants to help working Americans, it should stop fighting rearguard actions, and invent new ways to equip them to succeed in a global knowledge economy.\n\nWill Marshall is president of the Progressive Policy Institute.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:40.340+0000"}
{"entityId": 1633, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The former governor has been drawing serious heat as he prepares for his Monday rollout. But while he may be playing defense, he also has powerful friends to back him up.\n\nJeb Bush has a tricky day ahead of him. The soon-to-be-official candidate will roll out his campaign Monday to an increasingly skeptical press corps and a public that is queasy about reifying a political dynasty. Every presidential announcement has high stakes, but for Bush, the stakes are in the stratosphere. And he\u2019ll get by the way he always has: with a little help from his friends.\n\nBush has drawn nigh-unmitigated heat over a few issues: the relationship between his campaign and his super PAC, comments he made on Fox News about the wisdom of the Iraq War to go forward in Florida. So perhaps more than any of the 2016 candidates who announced their ambitions before him, Bush is playing defense. And he won\u2019t be playing defense alone.\n\nBush\u2019s trip to Orlando, Florida, two weeks ago highlighted just how effective his support network is. The candidate traveled there to speak at an invitation-only event convened by Gov. Rick Scott to allow 2016 contenders to speak to top business leaders and donors. Bush\u2014by far\u2014got the warmest welcome, drawing multiple standing ovations. And at least one billionaire afterward attended a closed-door gathering where the governor reacquainted himself with some of his most powerful supporters and answered questions off the record. While the national media scoffed at his struggles to answer a question on Iraq, the Floridians who made him a star sounded as loyal as ever.\n\nHis campaign announcement is another chance to persuade ambivalent would-be supporters and donors that he can gin up excitement.\n\nGeorge LeMieux, a former senator from the Sunshine State, called Bush the George Washington of Florida politics, crediting him with the growth and health of the state\u2019s Republican Party. LeMieux said Republicans\u2019 unusual success in Florida is due in part to Bush\u2019s devotion to the party there. And Republicans in the state have been remarkably effective. Although Florida is as purple as states come and voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Republicans control all the statewide elected offices except one and also hold both chambers of the legislature. The state has long incubated national conservative stars, and if Bush wins the GOP nomination in 2016, that victory will be due in large part to the many close and lucrative relationships he has there.\n\n\n\nSo his campaign announcement will give him a chance to demonstrate the extent of that support. In the past, his media-savvy allies have taken great care to choreograph the former governor\u2019s public appearances; at CPACearlier this year, they arranged for buses to pick up Bush supporters on K Street and in Georgetown and take them to the event, so he would get a warmer welcome than he would have otherwise. His campaign announcement is another chance to persuade ambivalent would-be supporters and donors that he can gin up excitement.\n\nAfter he pops America the question, he\u2019ll hit the road. A Jeb 2016 media advisory says he will talk in New Hampshire about a plan to create 19 million new jobs, and in South Carolina about \u201chow we can ensure America is a leader in the world again.\u201d He will also spend time in Iowa and Nevada.\n\nThe soon-to-be-official candidate spoke with The Washington Post in advance of the rollout, and his comments provided some insight into how he may approach the announcement.\n\n\u201cPersonally, I\u2019m an introvert,\u201d Bush told the paper. \u201cI\u2019m not, like, a gregarious guy, who needs the energy of a crowd to make me feel fulfilled. I\u2019d rather read a 20-page policy brief.\u201d\n\nMonday\u2019s rollout is a chance to show if he can make his wonky introvertedness an asset. His allies believe he can. His polls suggest it\u2019s doable. By the end of the day, we\u2019ll know more.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:40.690+0000"}
{"entityId": 1634, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why would a respected rabbi make such an outrageous statement? Look at the company he keeps.\n\nOn the surface, it was an arcane Biblical reference\u2014but beneath it, another sign of the sea change in Israel-American relations, and the evaporation of Israel\u2019s moderate Right.\n\nSaturday night, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin said in a speech, \u201cThe president of the United States is lashing out at Israel just like Haman lashed out at the Jews. I\u2019m not making a political statement\u2014I\u2019m making a Jewish statement.\u201d\n\nWhen someone in the audience shouted that the rabbi was being disrespectful to the president of the United States, he replied, \u201cI am being disrespectful because the president of the United States was disrespectful to my prime minister, to my country, to my future and to the future of the world.\u201d\n\nHidden in these few lines of coded language is a roadmap to all that has gone wrong in Israel\u2019s relationship to America.\n\nFirst, Rabbi Riskin is no fire-breathing fundamentalist. On the contrary, he is (or was) the kind of rabbi American Jews love. A moderate, Modern Orthodox scholar, he led New York\u2019s Lincoln Square synagogue from the 1960s (when Riskin was in his 20s) through the 1980s, turning it into one of the largest, most vibrant Modern Orthodox synagogues in America.\n\nWhen Riskin immigrated to Israel, he began anew, and enjoyed similar success, founding a network of schools and turning the settlement/suburb of Jerusalem Efrat into an expatriate haven. When I was just out of college, several of my friends lived there, and studied at its renowned yeshiva.\n\nAlong the way, he has maintained his religious moderation, writing several books and earning the respect of religious leaders, politicians, and, not least, American Jewish funders.\n\nBut his statement Saturday was shocking. As recorded in the Book of Esther\u2014and celebrated on the Purim holiday, which took place last month\u2014Haman is a genocidal Jew-hater who plots to murder every Jew in the Persian Empire. He is an antecedent to Hitler, nothing less.\n\nAnd there\u2019s yet another nuance. Religious Jews know that Haman is a descendant of the tribe of Amalek, described in the Torah as Israel\u2019s implacable enemy. Jews are commanded to completely annihilate them (Deut 25:19), leaving no survivors (Deut. 20:16), and destroying all of the tribe\u2019s property as well (I Samuel 15:3). It is a commandment for genocide, and Haman/Obama is the target.\n\nThe response has been swift. Rabbi Jill Jacobs, executive director of the liberal rabbinic organization T\u2019ruah, told The Daily Beast that \u201ccomparing President Obama to Haman, a descendant of Amalek whose destruction the Torah demands, isn\u2019t just political criticism\u2014it\u2019s dangerous. we\u2019ve seen horrific examples of extremists who have justified murder against those they consider Amalek.\u201d\n\nJacobs\u2019s organization has started an online petition with about 300 signatures, asking Riskin to retract his comment. Comparing Obama and Haman is \u201coutrageous and unacceptable,\u201d the petition says.\n\nRabbi Menachem Creditor, who during the 2014 Gaza operation wrote a viral op-ed saying he was \u201cdone apologizing for Israel,\u201d likewise had no sympathy for Riskin. Creditor told The Daily Beast that \u201cno Rabbi should be given the right to so coopt Judaism and reduce Zionism into talking points for or against a specific policy or leader.\u201d\n\nBehind these comments, though, is another, deeper story: the seduction of moderates like Riskin by Christian Zionism and the far-right narrative it represents.\n\nRiskin has long, deep connections with the Christian Zionist community.\n\nAs Rachel Tabachnick wrote in these pages last week, the Book of Esther has long been a favorite theme of Christian Zionists. The story is one of palace intrigue: the evil Haman plots against the Jews, but Queen Esther is secretly Jewish herself, and is able to foil his plans, at the bidding of her uncle Mordechai.\n\nIn the Christian Zionist version, the Christians are Esther, working within the system to save the Jews. That makes Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu into Mordechai\u2014the same role he assumed in Riskin\u2019s remarks. Indeed, Robert Stearns, one of the leaders of the Christian Zionist movement, made the same analogy shortly before Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress.\n\nAnd in fact, Riskin has long, deep connections with the Christian Zionist community. In 2008, he founded the Center for Jewish-Christian Understanding and Cooperation (CJCUC), which often acts as the host organization for evangelical trips to Israel, offering workshops such as \u201cDiscovering the Bible.\u201d\n\nSo, it\u2019s no surprise that Riskin is making the same references as his Christian Zionist allies; they are common currency in that community.\n\nRiskin also enjoys a close relationship with Christians United for Israel head John Hagee, whom he gave an award in 2012, and whom he has called \u201ca most impressive man with a clear, deep, articulate voice and a warm and embracing manner.\u201d\n\nIn fact, notwithstanding his significant financial resources, Hagee has long held extreme, even bizarre, views.\n\nLast fall, Hagee said that Ebola was God\u2019s punishment against America because of Obama\u2019s insufficient support of Israel. But not just Ebola. Hagee has also said that the 2008 financial crisis was Divine retribution, and 9/11 was \u201cthe judgment of God on our country\u201d because we \u201cdid not obey the law of God.\u201d\n\nAs for his status as \u201cdefender of Israel,\u201d Hagee has said that the Rapture is imminent, and that the Jews will not accept Jesus because they will have \u201cmade a deal with the Antichrist.\u201d They will thus die in the ensuing tribulations.\n\nThis ambivalent (if that\u2019s the word) relationship to Jews is typical of Christian Zionism. But Israel\u2019s right-wingers have long put up with it, since in the meantime, they receive financial and political support from Queen Esther\u201d in the United States.\n\nBut why Riskin, in particular? Why would someone so respected, and so moderate on some issues, be keeping company with zealots and parroting their extreme, even genocidal, rhetoric?\n\nThe wider story here is how moderate-religious Zionists like Riskin have slid ever farther rightward. Riskin used to describe himself as politically liberal, but as early as 1995, he was protesting the Oslo accords and aligning Efrat more with ideological settlements like Ariel, and less with its closer neighbors in Gush Etzion.\n\nTerritorial nationalism has trumped ideological moderation. Now, like the Jewish Home party (comprised, in part, by modern Orthodox Anglo-Israelis like him), Riskin combines religious moderation with political extremism. This community exists in its own media bubble, circulating the same feverish rhetoric about Iran, denying the same demographic realities about Palestine.\n\nAnd the more the world turns against Israeli policies, the more it validates the view that \u201cthe whole world is against us.\u201d The result has been a spiraling of settler nationalism that has Israel\u2019s security hawks alarmed.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:40.973+0000"}

Here comes the Great Wall of Trump.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building a wall,\u201d Donald Trump told moderator John Dickerson Sunday on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be a great wall. And, by the way, Mexico will pay for it. It\u2019s going to a great wall, because I know how to build. And it\u2019s not going to cost nearly as much as what they\u2019re saying for a crummy wall.\u201d\n\nThe GOP front-runner has no use for crummy walls. Crummy policies advocating repeal of the 14th Amendment and an end to birthright citizenship, yes. But crummy walls, no. It will even have a \u201cvery big, very beautiful door\u201d for people we want to let back in.\n\nTrump insists he was just kidding when he suggested during a campaign stop that the giant wall he promises to build on the 1,954-mile-long border with Mexico might one day bear his name.\n\nBut after two months of watching Trump the presidential candidate, Americans should have learned this much: When it comes to promoting his brand, Trump never kids.\n\nSo the Great Wall of Trump it is. The only thing left to decide is the exact size of the enormous letters spelling out \u201cTRUMP\u201d and whether they will face the U.S. or Mexico side.\n\nActually, there are a few other pesky details to work through. They come from a place I like to call: the real world.\n\nFor instance, those 1,954 miles cover just about every sort of terrain you can imagine\u2014valley, mountain, desert, river, Indian reservation, private land, state property. Ever try to build a wall on a river, or atop an Indian burial ground, or through the library of a state university? It\u2019s tricky. And once the environmentalists and the EPA get involved, it\u2019s nearly impossible.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that no one seems to know what it would cost. In the last six years, estimates for building a fence\u2014which is probably much cheaper than building a wall\u2014have ranged wildly from $1 million per mile to $15 million per mile, depending on where the fence goes. At that price, fencing for 2,000 miles would cost between $2 billion and $30 billion.\n\nCurrently, about a third of the border already has fencing, mostly in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. But building a wall probably means starting from scratch.\n\n\u201cGo ahead, folks. Knock yourselves out. Build, baby, build.\u201d\n\nUndeterred, Trump seems intent on building what could well be the Taj Majal of border walls.\n\nStill, I have yet more bad news for the emperor. After all the fuss, and what you can bet would be one unbelievably lavish grand opening, the Great Wall of Trump likely wouldn\u2019t do such a great job of stopping illegal immigration.\n\nYou see, walls won\u2019t do wonders. At least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard from border patrol agents each of the half dozen times I\u2019ve visited the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014in Arizona, Texas, and California. They don\u2019t mind the additional fencing, and many of them will tell you that it does tend to slow down some would-be border crossers and give border patrol agents more time to get to the scene.\n\nBut they just wish Congress didn\u2019t waste so much time and political capital on debating the fence as if it were a cure-all for illegal immigration.\n\nAs one especially wise border patrol agent once told me, \u201cThere is no barrier known to man that will stop someone who has traveled hundreds of miles to feed his family. He will go over, under, or around anything you put up.\u201d\n\nThe only way to put a dent in illegal immigration is to penalize employers. No jobs, no illegal immigrants. The trouble is, in both political parties, there is no appetite for getting tough with a group of people who can utter six little words that strike fear into the hearts of politicians everywhere: \u201cI\u2019m stopping payment on the check.\u201d\n\nIn fact, if our earlier attempts at building border walls and fencing in the early 1990s is any guide, a big wall might even backfire and make the problem worse.\n\nAs has been documented by noted border experts such as sociology professor Douglas Massey of Princeton and Wayne Cornelius of University of California, San Diego\u2014both of whom have studied the border for as long as Trump has bought real estate\u2014walls don\u2019t just keep people out but also pen people in.\n\nSo those 11 million undocumented immigrants who are already here won\u2019t feel so inclined to go home to Mexico for Christmas or Mother\u2019s Day, like they used to, and where there was always a chance that some of them would stay. Now, unsure that they\u2019d be able to return if they left, they\u2019ll just resign themselves to putting down roots and staying on this side of the border.\n\nThus, a measure intended to keep out additional Mexican immigrants might just ensure that we keep the ones who are already here.\n\nStill, I don\u2019t expect facts, cost, logic, research, or past experience to dissuade Trump or his supporters. They\u2019re stuck on the idea of building a giant, expensive, gaudy, white elephant wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. And nothing will pull them off.\n\nSo what more can I say, except: \u201cGo ahead, folks. Knock yourselves out. Build, baby, build.\u201d\n\nOnce you construct your precious wall, and immigrant smugglers respond by tripling their fees and building tunnels underneath it (or simply leasing drug tunnels that are already there) to stay in business, you can admit you were wrong, put aside simplistic solutions and think more deeply about how to deal with illegal immigration.\n\nTo show there are no hard feelings, I\u2019ll even recommend a company with some expertise in that area. Let\u2019s see. Where did I leave that business card? Oh yeah, here it is.\n\nPresident Trump should call the Golden State Fence Company in Riverside, California. Launched in 1984, the company\u2014which has contracted with the U.S. government to build fences on the U.S.-Mexico border\u2014at one point had as many as 750 employees and generated annual revenue of about $150 million.\n\nOh, wait. There is no more Golden State Fence Company. The outfit is now called Fenceworks, Inc. That\u2019s because the Golden State Fence Company was busted in 1999, 2004, and 2005 for hiring illegal immigrants\u2014to build the fencing that was meant to keep out illegal immigrants.\n\nImmigration agents estimate that as much as 50 percent of the company\u2019s workforce were in the country illegally. Owner Melvin Kay took a plea bargain where he paid $5 million and spent six months under house arrest, during which time he continued to bid on government contracts.\n\nWhen punishing those who employ illegal immigrants, that\u2019s how we roll. Americans talk loudly but carry a small stick. And the problem continues.\n\nSo, go ahead. Build your dang wall. Feel better.

Across the street from the church several residents of The Antonian, a senior citizen apartment building, sat on lawn chairs set up in the shade of elm trees that acted as an awning against the coming afternoon heat while hundreds stood in a long line that stretched for blocks down West 10th Street waiting for Beau Biden\u2019s wake to begin.\n\nThe sound of motorcycles ruffled the thick air as several police vehicles came up West 9th and stopped near the main entrance to St. Anthony\u2019s, a sprawling stone cathedral with stained glass windows and a red Mediterranean shingle roof. A hearse followed the motorcycles and then an honor guard gently lifted a casket from the hearse and carried it down the center aisle of the church.\n\nJust after 1 o\u2019clock, the Biden family arrived, a large sprawling Irish Catholic unit of one as familiar here as the waters of the Delaware River. They were led by Joe Biden wearing aviator sunglasses, dark blue suit, white shirt, stripe tie and a soft, gentle face that alternated between sadness and a forced smile of habit. Within minutes, he was in front of the altar, standing straight as a sentry, an arm\u2019s length from the flag-draped casket containing the soul and spirit of Beau Biden, his oldest boy.\n\nHe was the Vice President of the United States but here in the heart of Wilmington he was simply Joe, again a grieving parent grinding his way through a day in a life that was one more bead of The Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re here I think,\u201d Agnes Daughtery told her sister Elma.\n\n\u201cThe line will start to move now,\u201d her sister replied.\n\nGALLERY: America Mourns at Beau Biden's Funeral\n\n\n\nKevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nThe two women had been standing on West 10th alongside the church for nearly an hour waiting for the family to arrive. They drove down from the Philadelphia suburbs and parked in a lot three blocks away on Pennsylvania Avenue by Grotto Pizza.\n\n\u201cSoon as we got out of the car a woman said to us, \u2018You can\u2019t park there. Customers park there,\u2019\u201d Agnes Daughtery said. \u201cBut when we told her why we were here, for Beau Biden\u2019s wake, she said, \u2018Ohmigod, I\u2019m sorry. Sure. Leave it there, honey.\u2019\u201d\n\nTwenty yards away, at the top of West 10th, people came through the magnetometers placed beneath a long white tent top. Many of them were dignitaries, senators and members of Congress, familiar faces from the national media and all were ushered past the long line toward the front entrance of the church. The line in front of Agnes Daughtery did not move as the sun began to dominate the day.\n\nNow it was close to 2:30 p.m. and she and her sister had made it to the steps that led up to the school gym that is connected to the parish elementary school. Many in front of and behind her were simply there out of loyalty and devotion and friendship with the grieving family. They had come from different places and different distance; from Washington, from Scranton, Baltimore, Philadelphia, down the street, across town and they comprised a militia of the mournful, standing in the heat of the day, simply waiting to offer the young man\u2019s parents, his wife, his children, his brother and sister, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces their condolences for a life lost too young and a family asked to bear nearly too much.\n\nThey wore suits and dark dresses, jeans, khakis, short sleeve shirts, sneakers and dress shoes. They were as American a gathering as the eye will ever encounter and they were quiet, respectful, patient and heartbroken as the line snaked slowly up 14 steps and formed a serpentine unit as it twisted into the relief of the shade inside the school gymnasium.\n\nThe crowd was the core, the heart, soul and foundation of support and solace for a promising future taken and a parent who has remained amazingly human and normal while surrounded by trappings of power and prestige. Joe Biden is an emotional man and, now, as the hours passed and the crowds did not diminish he found strength and comfort in each person as they slowly, very slowly, made their way toward the altar, the casket and a whole, proud family that carried loss with both dignity and gratitude for who Beau Biden was and what he\u2019s accomplished in 46 years.\n\n\u201cLook at all the championships,\u201d Agnes Daughtery said to her sister, pointing to the pennants hanging on the gym wall.\n\n\u201cThe Tigers,\u201d Elma said, indicating the school team\u2019s nickname. \u201cI guess they\u2019re pretty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a normal person, not just a politician, and I\u2019m proud to be here.\u201d\n\nThe pennants were black and orange. They honored more than a decade\u2019s worth of victories in girl\u2019s volleyball, boy\u2019s baseball and individual honors as well. Quotes from Knute Rockne, John Wooden and Lou Holtz had been stitched on flag-like cloths and hung alongside the pennants.\n\nIt took an hour and a half for the line to snake through the gym and back outdoors to the terrace next to a side entrance of the church. It was just past 4 p.m. now and a soft breeze brought some relief to the waiting crowd. Many of the men had removed their jackets and more than a few people left the line to sit on benches set beneath a tent top outside the gym, the benches and tables arranged for the beginning of the annual St. Anthony\u2019s Italian Festival scheduled to begin Sunday.\n\nA Catholic wake is part remembrance, part devotion and a permanent gesture of friendship, respect and love for the departed as well as the living left with memories and broken hearts. There is unity and strength in grief.\n\nBy 5 p.m. both sisters had made it to the narrow steps of the church\u2019s side entrance. There, they could see and hear the Vice President of the United States as he greeted the hundreds who circled along the side aisle of the church and down the center aisle to the waiting family.\n\nJoe Biden would stand there from his arrival at 1 p.m. until the last of the mourners left shortly after 11 p.m. Friday. He was a swirl of emotion, never leaving his dead son\u2019s side. His family stood there with him.\n\nHe seemed to get stronger as he grasped the hand of each visitor. Within him, his son Beau still lived. In his eyes and in his mind, he could see still the boy, Beau, in a hospital bed alongside his brother Hunter, both of them nearly killed in a car crash that took their mother and baby sister in the winter of 1972, weeks after he had been first elected to the United States Senate. He could see himself playing catch with his boys, writing letters to them as they were hospitalized and, later, as they marched bravely through a life shattered already by loss. He saw his son riding the train with him to Washington and back, saw himself walking through the door at the end of nearly every day to talk with them about school, about supper, about the road ahead. He was, for Beau, for all his children, for his whole family, the embodiment of the religious hymn, \u201cBe Not Afraid.\u201d\n\nNow it was nearly 5:30 p.m. and the sisters stood 20 feet from the altar, the casket and the Biden family. In front of them, Joe Biden hugged a man who walked with the aid of a cane. He turned to his wife Jill and said, \u201cI went to high school with this guy. He\u2019s a barber. Used to cut my hair \u2026 when I had enough hair to cut. God love ya\u2019, thanks for coming. It means a lot to me and our family.\u201d\n\nAgnes Daughtery and her sister Elma stood next in line. After six and a half hours they quietly summoned all their strength to offer their support and sorrow for a loss that seemed nearly unbearable to them. Joe Biden held their hand, hugged them both, thanked them for coming and kissed each woman on the cheek. They went next to Jill Biden, then Beau\u2019s wife Hallie and then his brother Hunter.

{"entityId": 1637, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "At first, The Judicial Crisis Network backed Bush nominees. Now the dark money group reaches deep into state capitals. Here\u2019s how it grew.\n\nUpdated: New material has been added to this article since its original publication on 3/23.\n\n\n\nIt was a cold winter night in Washington, D.C., not long after President George W. Bush won a second term, and the mood at the upscale Italian restaurant was downright celebratory.\n\nThe most prominent guest was Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, but his table also boasted a mix of high-powered conservatives, including some deep-pocketed donors. Among the elite were Federalist Society executive Leonard Leo, fundraiser and lawyer Ann Corkery, and California real estate magnate Robin Arkley II. \u201cThe big prize was to sit next to Scalia,\u201d quipped one attendee at the soiree, adding that Arkley was one such lucky winner.\n\nAs it happened, the bash coincided with the birth of a new judicial advocacy outfit that Corkery was instrumental in launching, and Arkley in funding, according to conservative sources familiar with the events. The Judicial Confirmation Network (JCN), set up as a 501(c)(4) \u201csocial welfare\u201d group that doesn\u2019t disclose its donors, would prove to be a crucial player in drumming up support for Bush Supreme Court nominees John Roberts Jr. and Samuel Alito Jr.\u2014eventual allies for Scalia on the Court\u2019s right flank.\n\nIn the years since, JCN\u2019s modus operandi and battlegrounds have shifted\u2014particularly since Barack Obama won the White House, which prompted the group to sound the alarm and change its name to the Judicial Crisis Network. In the ensuing years, not only has it fought to block Obama\u2019s nominees to the high court, but it has spent millions to sway state judicial elections and attorneys general races, helping to uphold state laws backed by conservatives, nurture like-minded talent in the states, and advance pro-business, limited-government legal agendas aligned with its donors\u2019 leanings.\n\nTo expand its influence in state elections, JCN has emerged as a pipeline for secret money to other, better-known dark money groups like the Wisconsin Club for Growth and the American Future Fund which, in turn, have spent big bucks in state Supreme Court and AG races.\n\nJCN heightened its focus on AG races last year when it pumped $1 million in secret money into the Republican Attorneys General Association, making it the third-biggest contributor to RAGA and helping the GOP pick up three new slots so that it now controls the majority of state AG posts.\n\nJCN\u2019s pivotal part in the surge of spending on court elections has received scant attention. But in 2012, it dished out more than $2 million in court races in Michigan alone\u2014half of that in a single down-ticket state circuit contest, according to the Michigan Campaign Finance Network. And over the last two years, the organization contributed a minimum of about $2 million to groups that were involved in 2014 state judicial elections and efforts to influence how judges are chosen. Recipients of JCN checks included the many-tentacled Republican State Leadership Committee, which for the first time invested in court races around the country, spending more on them than any other outside group.\n\nMore broadly, in the last election cycle TV ad spending in state Supreme Court elections jumped to at least $13.8 million, according to a preliminary tally by the nonprofit Justice at Stake Campaign. Outside groups, both conservative and liberal, accounted for an estimated $4.9 million of that, or more than 35 percent\u2014a greater share than ever before.\n\nThe sharp rise in judicial election spending by JCN and other groups on both sides of the political aisle troubles some judicial candidates who have been targeted. \u201cTo the extent that judicial campaigns start looking like other campaigns, there\u2019s a risk that judges will be perceived as having a political agenda,\u201d Sam Ervin IV, a North Carolina Supreme Court justice, told The Daily Beast. Ervin, who was elected in 2014 and is the grandson of the celebrated senator who led Congress\u2019s investigation of the Watergate scandal, lost an earlier race in 2012 after a spending blitz by several outside groups totaling almost $2.6 million, much of it dark money including $75,000 from JCN. \u201cThe public is better served, in an environment where judges are elected, if they know the source of the funding for those campaigns,\u201d Ervin, a Democrat, added.\n\nTo fill its own coffers, JCN has increasingly relied on funding\u2014to the tune of nearly $4 million, according to IRS documents\u2014from another non-disclosing group, the Wellspring Committee, that\u2019s run by Corkery and was founded seven years ago with the help of conservative donors in the network led by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. Corkery\u2019s entree to that rarefied network came via JCN supporter Arkley, an early attendee of their famed retreats. And Ann Corkery and her husband, Neil\u2014who is JCN\u2019s treasurer\u2014are central figures in a cluster of other nonprofits, according to IRS documents.\n\nA fast rise\n\nJCN\u2019s early niche entailed working in tandem with a well-organized conservative coalition\u2014in which Leo, the Federalist Society\u2019s executive vice president, was a key player\u2014to ensure that Roberts and Alito won Senate confirmation. To that end, JCN spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in 2005 and January 2006 on radio and online ads, as well as on grassroots efforts, to shape public opinion. One example: The group ran a radio ad blitz in late 2005 in Arkansas, where the two Democratic senators\u2019 votes were considered in play, using Christmas themes and an appeal from a black minister.\n\nWell-connected consultants helped JCN get things up and running. One was Gary Marx, a rising social conservative star who Corkery recruited to became the group\u2019s executive director, according to a well-placed source.\n\nAnother was New York lawyer Wendy Long, a former clerk for Clarence Thomas. She left the law firm Kirkland & Ellis and signed on as counsel to JCN, becoming the organization\u2019s face on cable news and buttressing its legal bona fides.\n\nBut mostly, JCN\u2019s early rise was attributable to Corkery\u2019s ability to rope in a few big donors. \u201cAnn is very good at cultivating relationships and capitalizing on them,\u201d a conservative source observed.\n\n\n\nIn the last election cycle TV ad spending in state Supreme Court elections jumped to at least $13.8 million. Outside groups, both conservative and liberal, accounted for an estimated $4.9 million of that.\n\nRobin Arkley, the president and CEO of Security National Corp. who had tapped Corkery to be his political liaison and senior advisor, became a key underwriter of JCN\u2019s operations, to the tune of the high six or low seven figures, sources say. The pair went to some of the early fundraising and policy retreats held by the Kochs\u2014events that now draw a glittering cast of wealthy allies and conservative stars to raise millions for the brothers\u2019 network of politically active groups. Arkley was also a financial backer of the Federalist Society. \u201cArkley helped put Ann in play\u201d as a liaison to funding for advocacy groups on the right, said one conservative.\n\nCorkery had a breakthrough year in 2008. Koch operatives gave her the reins to their fledgling Wellspring Committee, a dark money conduit that began pumping funds to other dark money Koch-backed groups like Americans for Prosperity. At the same time, Corkery served as a finance vice chair for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nThough Corkery\u2019s most direct Koch ties frayed after the \u201908 elections and Arkley\u2019s wallet took a hit in the financial crisis, according to sources and reports, Corkery mined other big donors she\u2019d been courting for Wellspring, such as John Templeton Jr., a Pennsylvania philanthropist, and New York hedge fund mogul Paul Singer, conservative sources said.\n\nConservative and business groups had been pouring money into state court elections through the early 2000s in order to produce a friendlier legal climate\u2014one that curbed tort liability for corporations, for example. Smart marketing and intellectual heft provided by Leo\u2019s Federalist Society helped them notch significant gains. From 2000 to 2009, business and conservative groups spent more than twice as much on state court elections as plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers, unions, and liberal groups\u2014$26.3 million to $11.9 million, according to Justice at Stake.\n\nWellspring, followed quickly by JCN, became big players in directly and indirectly funding state Supreme Court races. In 2008, for example, it funneled $200,000 to a Wisconsin group that produced the negative attack ads that helped a conservative eke out a victory over a sitting Supreme Court justice, tipping control of the bench to the right. In 2009, Wellspring grants went to groups trying to change judicial selection methods in Missouri and Tennessee.\n\nIn 2010, Wellspring began sending money directly to JCN, giving it and a related organization, the Judicial Education Project, $400,000; an additional $306,000 came in 2011, then $1.5 million in 2012 and $1.4 million the next year. Big grants also went to other organizations playing in judicial politics\u2014including $400,000 in 2011 for Wisconsin Club for Growth, a major actor in that state\u2019s shift to a conservative Supreme Court majority.\n\nWisconsin Club for Growth was also aided by JCN to the tune of more than half-a-million dollars from mid-2012 to mid-2013 as JCN began to function as a dark money conduit like Wellspring. The Wisconsin group spent close to $400,000 to help win a second 10-year term for Justice Patience Roggensack.\n\nAnd an investigation into whether Walker illegally coordinated efforts with several groups\u2014including Wisconsin Club for Growth\u2014in the run-up to his 2012 recall vote now depends on a ruling by the state\u2019s justices. The special prosecutor leading the probe has asked at least one\u2014perhaps all four\u2014of the court\u2019s conservatives to recuse themselves because of support they have gotten from the groups. (Given recent history and the state\u2019s weak judicial conduct rules, court observers say that seems unlikely.)\n\nThe lower court money bomb\n\nWhile turning, and keeping, the Wisconsin court conservative was a high priority for JCN and others on the right, the group didn\u2019t spend much cash there directly. But the opposite was true in neighboring Michigan, where JCN laid out more than $2 million on two 2012 court races. About half the money went to an effort to keep law professor Bridget McCormack from sitting on the state Supreme Court, including a last-minute ad accusing McCormack of volunteering to represent terrorists, featuring the mother of a soldier killed in Afghanistan. (McCormack did volunteer one of her law school clinics to represent a Guantanamo detainee, though he was released before the students communicated with him.)\n\nThe other $1 million, though, was spent attempting to kick an Oakland County Circuit Court judge off the bench\u2014and JCN\u2019s spending in that race was matched by Americans for Job Security, which had earlier benefited from Wellspring largesse.\n\nSuch staggering spending on a lower court contest may be unprecedented, and it was far from clear why the groups were interested. One possible explanation: a funder with an ax to grind.\n\nWho that was may never be known. But \u201cpretty much everyone believed\u201d it to be Manoj Bhargava or a person or entity linked to him, said a Michigan lawyer who had a ringside seat at the time; other attorneys and journalists in the state told The Daily Beast the same thing.\n\n\n\nThe Indian-born Bhargava, who invented the now-ubiquitous 5-Hour Energy shot, might be seen by some as a walking contradiction. On the one hand, he lived as a monk in India for years and has taken a pledge to give more than half his wealth to charity. But he\u2019s also a fierce competitor who, according to a profile in Forbes, displays in his office cardboard tombstones bearing the names of rivals his company has beaten in court.\n\nA 2012 case before Circuit Judge Phyllis McMillen may shed light on the origins of the campaign against her. Bhargava, through 5-Hour\u2019s parent company Innovation Ventures, was suing a key 5-Hour contractor for allegedly stealing trade secrets. McMillen was presiding over the case. At first she issued a temporary restraining order against the contractor. As facts emerged, though, she lifted the TRO. To allow Innovation Ventures to \u201ccrush competitors\u201d unfairly, she said in court February 10, \u201cis certainly not something that\u2019s supported by public policy.\u201d\n\nMcMillen was running for her first full term in 2012. That spring, soon after she lifted the TRO, she and her colleagues who were also on the ballot learned they had opposition: a couple of lawyers from Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette\u2019s office. Three non-Michiganders had provided the seed money for their candidacies: Andrew McKenna of Virginia, a Republican fundraising consultant with ties to Bhargava, according to a well-placed source; John Templeton, one of Ann Corkery\u2019s funding sources; and John Bryan of Oregon, a retired oil and chemicals executive who spoke at one of the Koch confabs.\n\nConservative control of the Wisconsin court, enabled in no small part by the big pots of dark money dumped into the state, has proved vital to the rejection of challenges to two signature conservative policies championed by GOP Governor Scott Walker.\n\nTV ads sponsored by JCN and its dark money ally showed up closer to the election, with some attacking McMillen (one made her appear to have been lenient with a habitual offender) and others praising the challengers. \u201cThey were on every half-hour,\u201d McMillen told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was relentless.\u201d There was radio, too, and a torrent of direct mail.\n\nBhargava did not respond to numerous requests for comment.\n\nIn any case, JCN\u2019s Wolverine State crusades didn\u2019t work out too well. McCormack is now a Supreme Court justice and McMillen won her contest, too. In early 2013, she ruled against Bhargava.\n\nAttorneys general become focus\n\nJCN\u2019s surging dark money dollars found a new outlet last year when the network ponied up $1 million to the Republican Attorneys General Association for its 2014 drive to help the GOP capture AG seats in Nevada, Colorado, and elsewhere. That made JCN RAGA\u2019s third-largest donor in a year when RAGA was instrumental in helping Republicans capture enough AG posts that they now hold the majority. RAGA and similar 527 organizations must disclose their donors, but the sources of JCN\u2019s contributions remain in the dark.\n\nOn top of that, JCN sent $750,000 to the Iowa-based American Future Fund, which started its own AG project between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2013, tax filings show\u2014JCN\u2019s largest grant of that fiscal year. In turn, AFF chipped in $680,000 to RAGA last year.\n\nState attorneys general had been moving higher on JCN\u2019s political radar. Policy director and chief counsel Carrie Severino, who succeeded Wendy Long as JCN\u2019s counsel in 2010 and, like her, once clerked for Justice Thomas, wrote in National Review right before the 2012 elections that conservative AGs are \u201cemerging as key leaders in the battle for limited constitutional government.\u201d Many of them, she noted, had joined the challenge to Obamacare, and a number were also fighting the Dodd-Frank financial services overhaul and EPA regulations.\n\nDark money ties that bind\n\nThe JCN spending through RAGA to boost the GOP\u2019s share of AG slots is just one example of the synergies that the network has forged as a dark money vehicle. Other ties binding JCN to various groups it has funded\u2014and received money from\u2014are evident in the comings and goings of personnel, consultants, and board members. For instance, when Gary Marx stepped down as JCN\u2019s executive director in mid-2011, he took a similar post with Ralph Reed\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition (a group that Wellspring helped in 2010 with a $250,000 check). Likewise, last year Chris Jankowski became a consultant to JCN after spending several years running the Republican State Leadership Committee until he departed suddenly in early 2014, according to multiple sources. Both JCN and Wellspring had funneled hundreds of thousands to the RSLC, which has helped the GOP chart major gains in legislatures and other state offices. (RAGA had been part of that group but was spun off early last year.)\n\nTV ads sponsored by JCN and its dark money ally showed up closer to the election, with some attacking McMillen. \u201cThey were on every half-hour,\u201d McMillen told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was relentless.\u201d\n\nBut JCN\u2019s tightest ties with any group or individual revolve around Ann and Neil Corkery, which meant that Wellspring\u2019s links to JCN were personal as well as political. Serendipitously Ann Corkery\u2019s husband Neil was JCN\u2019s treasurer, a paid part-time gig. The group\u2019s small board also includes Dan Casey, a veteran GOP operative and \u201cthe political and PR brains\u201d of that shop, says one source. Wellspring\u2019s board was made up of Ann Corkery and two people the Corkerys knew from their work with Catholic groups.\n\nBut in 2011, the ties between these two dark money machines grew even closer when Ann Corkery sacked her two fellow board members at Wellspring and replaced them with her daughter and the son of JCN board member Casey, according to IRS filings and former board members. One of those ousted, treasurer Steven Wagner, said, \u201cI never saw any financial records. I was treasurer in name only.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, tax records show that Neil Corkery was not only treasurer of JCN, president of its allied Judicial Education Project, and executive director of a charity called the Sudan Relief Fund, all of which paid him salaries; but he also drew paychecks from at least four other organizations: the anti-gay union National Organization for Marriage, ActRight Action, the Catholic Association Foundation, and Catholic Voices. His total earnings were almost $450,000, and his weekly workload was 105 hours in the first half of the year, the groups' IRS filings show, before dropping back to a mere 80.\n\n\n\nSome who are familiar with the groups are dubious about that workaholic schedule\u2014especially at the Sudan charity, where Corkery was paid $235,000 for a supposed 40-hour workweek. Neither Ann nor Neil Corkery responded to phone messages or written requests for comment on this story.\n\nMoving Ahead\n\n\n\nCritics notwithstanding, the board changes at Wellspring a few years ago seemed to spell good news for JCN, coinciding with the two recent years in which JCN received close to $3 million from Wellspring and allowing the network to ramp up its efforts in the states.\n\nAnd JCN has been otherwise busy, too\u2014churning out, for example, amicus briefs for major legal challenges to Obama administration policies, including the high-profile case that now threatens to undermine key sections of Obamacare which was argued before the Supreme Court in early March.\n\nThe group doesn\u2019t always toe the mainstream GOP line: It has at times weighed in against Republicans in what look like internal party spats fueled by donor preferences.\n\nUltimately JCN looks poised to continue its role as a dark money juggernaut in 2016 in state and federal elections\u2014both directly and via allied dark money and 527 conduits. If JCN\u2019s recent history proves a guide, that means voters going to the polls in 2016 will remain largely uninformed about who\u2019s writing the network\u2019s big checks for ad and grassroots drives to help elect the highest judicial and legal officers in the states, and senators who may well have to approve nominees to fill future Supreme Court vacancies.\n\nRobert Maguire of the Center for Responsive Politics contributed to this piece", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:42.503+0000"}
{"entityId": 1638, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Muslim Americans are a natural fit for the GOP. But as the recent attacks on Carly Fiorina show, they\u2019re not over Islamophobic rhetoric.\n\nI\u2019m baffled by why the GOP continues to demonize and alienate Muslim Americans given that they could be making inroads with the community. As Suhail Khan, a Muslim-American Republican who served in the Bush administration, explained when he recently appeared on my SiriusXM radio show, many Muslims would be a perfect fit for the GOP.\n\nKhan is right. Muslim Americans are now climbing in economic status and numbers. In 2007, only 13 percent of Muslim Americans earned over $100,000, but that number has now climbed to over 20 percent, eclipsing the average in the United States. Many of those people will, of course, support lower taxes and smaller government.\n\nAnd the number of well off Muslim Americans will likely rise quickly in the near future considering 39 percent of Muslim Americans have college degrees, which is well above the national average of 27 percent. Plus Muslims cherish another issue championed by the right: religious liberty. (But in the truest sense, not as a ruse to discriminate against people.)\n\nBut the extreme voices within continue to drive Muslims away. At this point I can only assume that Republican leaders want to build a coalition for the 2016 race composed primarily of angry white Christian men.\n\nThis, however, is truly a losing strategy. Even Senator Lindsey Graham candidly warned back in 2012 that the GOP is losing the demographic battle because \u201cWe\u2019re not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\u201d But so far the 2016 race has shown us more of the same from his fellow Republicans\u2014horrible comments about Latinos, extreme positions on women, and now more hate towards Muslims.\n\nWhat is surprising is that I honestly thought the GOP would be more embracing, even to Muslims, in 2016. My optimism was buttressed a few months ago after Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal regurgitated a wholly fabricated claim by Fox News that there were Muslim \u201cno go zones\u201d in Europe where non-Muslims fear to tread and he warned that American Muslims would soon do the same here.\n\nThis claim was so preposterous that Fox News apologized not once but four times on air after one of their regular guests offered such a baseless assertion. After those remarks, Jindal didn\u2019t move up on the polls. (Technically I may be running ahead of Jindal right now.) And when I didn\u2019t hear leading Republican presidential candidates spew anti-Muslim bigotry, I thought things were truly changing.\n\nBut I was wrong. First a few weeks ago we heard, during the \u201ckid\u2019s table\u201d GOP debate, both Lindsey Graham and George Pataki call for monitoring mosques in America.\n\n\n\nAnd now Carly Fiorina is being attacked by some on the right for saying nice things about Muslims. (Unreal, I know.)\n\nAnd now Carly Fiorina is being attacked by some on the right for saying nice things about Muslims. (Unreal, I know.) Fiorina\u2019s comments weren\u2019t even recent: She made them 14 years ago, in the weeks after 9/11, while she was the CEO of Hewlett Packard.\n\nAt that time we had just witnessed a spike in anti-Arab and anti Muslim hate crimes. A Sikh man wearing a turban was even killed in Arizona simply because he appeared to be a Muslim. So Fiorina spoke to her diverse group of employees expressing concern for the safety of her Middle Eastern and Muslims colleagues. She also mentioned the contributions that Islam and Arabs had made throughout history, with comments like, \u201cThe technology industry would not exist without the contributions of Arab mathematicians.\u201d\n\nThis is not much different from what we heard form President George W. Bush in the weeks after 9/11. But it was simply too much for Michele Bachmann and others on the right. How dare anyone show compassion for Muslims! So on Sunday Bachmann shared with her 240,000 Twitter followers an article attacking Fiorina for having the audacity to praise Muslims.\n\nThe article\u2019s author, Bethany Blankley (a Bachmann wannabe), takes issue with the concept that Muslims ever contributed anything to the world. I hope Blankley doesn\u2019t like coffee or ever have to use a hospital, both Muslim inventions.\n\n\n\nShe further claimed that Fiorina\u2019s comments were \u201coffensive\u201d and angrily suggested: \u201cPerhaps [Fiorina] she should move to Saudi Arabia where women are prohibited from driving; or Iran, where women are prohibited from working.\u201d\n\nNow Blankley is correct that, out of the 57 Muslim-majority nations, Saudi Arabia is the only one that bans women from driving\u2014proving this is a Saudi issue, not one based on Islam. But she\u2019s wrong about women in Iran. A quick Google search reveals that women in Iran are highly educated and hold jobs in both the government and in the private sector in a range of professions from doctors to teachers. (Although work on gender equality is very much needed in Iran.)\n\nOther conservative outlets, like The American Thinker, also chided Fiorina. This is no different than in past generations when progressive politicians were demonized as \u201cNegro lovers\u201d for championing equal rights for black Americans.\n\nIt\u2019s all in keeping with a theme of Republican attacks on minorities and women this cycle. Most on the right remained silent when Donald Trump called Mexicans \u201crapists.\u201d They didn\u2019t speak out when Scott Walker and Marco Rubio advocated that women raped must carry the rapist\u2019s baby to term. And they didn\u2019t say a peep when Mike Huckabee stated over the weekend that a 10-year-old girl who was raped should be forced to carry the rapist\u2019s baby until birth.\n\nAnd praising Muslims\u2014even 14 years ago \u2014is simply too much for the right-wing fringe. Of course, we\u2019re unlikely to hear other Republican candidates defending Fiorina or condemning the attacks.\n\nApparently the GOP can\u2019t get out of its own way. The 2016 election has been another parade of appeals to angry white men at the expense of women and minorities. We saw how well that worked for them in 2008 and 2012. Given the changing demographics in America, it should be even worse for them in 2016.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:43.283+0000"}
{"entityId": 1639, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Most Christians are going to adapt to the new America just fine.\n\nSince the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that legalized marriage equality in America, some conservative Christians have been downright apoplectic. In a ridiculously offensive analogy, right wing anti-equality zealot Bryan Fischer tweeted:\n\nChanneling a similar anger, though in a more commonly heard form, Fox News commentator Todd Starnes tweeted:\n\nMeanwhile, Rod Dreher of the American Conservative has, in his own words, a more sober analysis of the decision on Time\u2019s website:\n\n\u201c[W]e have to accept that we really are living in a culturally post-Christian nation. The fundamental norms Christians have long been able to depend on no longer exist. To be frank, the court majority may impose on the rest of the nation a view widely shared by elites, but it is also a view shared by a majority of Americans. There will be no widespread popular resistance to Obergefell. This is the new normal.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo which the vast majority of Americans say, \u201cHallelujah!\u201d Dreher is correct\u2014the idea of equal treatment for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans (if not its full realization yet) is indeed the new normal in America. Even before the court\u2019s decision, 6 in 10 Americans supported the right of same-sex couples to marry\u2014and over half of Americans said they would be less likely to support any 2016 presidential candidate who opposed marriage equality.\n\nYet some conservatives have tried to paint this cultural evolution\u2014or even revolution\u2014as fundamentally at odds with Christianity. That\u2019s where they\u2019re wrong.\n\nThe Episcopalian Church embraced gay marriage last week. Earlier this year, the Presbyterian Church (USA) affirmed its support for marriage equality, joining many other major Christian denominations that officially endorse LGBT rights. And according to an April 2015 poll, majorities of congregants within many Christian faith traditions support marriage equality\u2014including 60 percent of all Catholics, 52 percent of all orthodox Christians and 62 percent of white mainline Protestants. They\u2019re joined by 94 percent of Unitarian Universalists and 77 percent of all Jews.\n\nPerhaps most strikingly, 64 percent of self-identified Millennial evangelicals support same-sex marriage. As the literal future of orthodox Christianity, it would be hard to paint their views as at odds with such orthodoxy. Rather, they are a portrait of that future\u2014not of a post-Christian America, but a post-homophobic Christianity. That is the \u201cnew normal\u201d that Obergefall does not singularly usher in but merely reflects. The world has changed. Christians and Christianity has changed, too. And again, I say, \u201cHallelujah!\u201d\n\nWill anti-gay Christians be politically and socially ostracized? I sure hope so.\n\nWill anti-gay Christians be politically and socially ostracized? I sure hope so. Just as those orthodox Christians who still believe in strict, traditional gender roles have been increasingly mocked as absurd. Once upon a time, marriage constituted property\u2014the wife was the literal property of the husband, and could not legally let alone culturally own anything of her own. The governing cultural norm was that women should be barefoot, pregnant and subservient.\n\nThose norms were reinforced by religion, but our interpretation of religion, like the Constitution, is obviously influenced by contemporary conditions. We apply the Constitution to Internet regulations, even though the Founding Fathers definitely didn\u2019t foresee such technological evolutions. And we demand our faith traditions stretch and grow as well.\n\nThere are, of course, still congregations that haven\u2019t caught up with the times. But churches have always been able to use their discretion to decide whom to marry or turn away, and the Supreme Court ruling in Obergefell specifically noted such First Amendment protections for religious institutions.\n\nAs for everyone else, including florists and county clerks, yes, you will now have to provide the same services to straight couples that you provide to gay couples. Don\u2019t like it? Find a new job. The law also requires that clerks issue birth certificates to the children of single mothers and that florists provide flowers for interracial weddings, regardless of the religious beliefs that have definitely been cited now and throughout history to condemn these families as well. Still, that doesn\u2019t mean the law is trouncing on religion. It means the law is prioritizing equal treatment for all, as it should.\n\nIn 1992, Pat Buchanan gave a speech to the Republican National Convention, known as \u201cThe Culture War Speech.\u201d In it, he spoke for those like himself who felt their traditional values under attack: \u201cThere is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war, as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as was the Cold War itself, for this war is for the soul of America.\u201d\n\nWell, wars are won and lost. Liberty, freedom and the ever-bending arc toward equality have won. Intolerance and hate have lost. But this was not a war of liberty versus religion; the war itself took place within religion, including within Christianity itself. And Christianity is ultimately taking the side of equality and liberty, too.\n\nTo those who remain in the fringe minority stubbornly mired in hatred and the dark rationalizations of the past, please try to lose gracefully.

I got temporarily famous.\n\nI\u2019ll be honest: I was kind of dreading jury duty. And when I heard Donald Trump was going to be there, I wasn\u2019t excited\u2014I just figured there would be more security and longer lines.\n\nAfter I made it through the sea of reporters huddled on the courthouse steps and through security, I found my way to the jury selection room and took a seat in the back row. I chatted with a friend from school (who had also been selected) about our study-abroad experiences and the coming semester.\n\nThen Donald, who had been standing in the back of the room, took a seat three chairs away. The millennial urge to take a selfie immediately struck me.\n\nAfter a few test runs with my camera, I was ready for the Snapchat.\n\nI started with an image of myself and slowly panned it to the left capturing the Donald in all his glory. I labeled it \u201cjust your average day at jury duty.\u201d I posted it to my story. I posted it to the New York Snapchat story. Then I went back to talking to my friend.\n\nI have to say: I felt a little weird about taking a covert Snapchat. It seemed like everyone in the room was sneaking photos of the poor guy as he sat there talking to no one and doing nothing.\n\nAfter the two women in between us left, I worked up the courage to talk to him. As a life-long New Yorker, I\u2019ve always said I feel comfortable speaking to anyone.\n\n\u201cWhat are you eating for lunch?\u201d I asked.\n\nHe kind of chuckled and told me he hadn\u2019t thought about it. That had to be a lie because there\u2019s little else to think of during the morning session.\n\nAn announcement broke up further conversation and then I was swarmed by reporters asking for my name, age, and reaction to the conversation. Minutes passed and I decided to talk to him again.\n\nWhen I started looking at some of the sites that posted my video, I was disappointed to see that many of them claimed that my Snapchat showed Trump napping.\n\n\u201cIs it nice to have a break from the campaign trail?\u201d I asked. He laughed again.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly different,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat would you do as president to speed up this jury selection process?\u201d I said, joking.\n\n\u201cI think this is pretty good,\u201d he replied.\n\nI have to agree with him, actually. Irene, the jury clerk who was running the selection process, was full of energy and clear in her directions. We talked a bit more about how good of a job she was doing before another announcement for lunch rang out. We all got up and left.\n\nIt didn\u2019t take long for my phone to start blowing up with texts from friends telling me that my video had become famous. Snapchat picked up my video for their New York story, websites had written articles about my Snapchat, and ABC wanted to interview me. I found the whole thing hilarious and somewhat exhilarating.\n\nHowever, when I started looking at some of the sites that posted my video, I was disappointed to see that many of them claimed that my Snapchat showed Trump napping. The jury duty room is one of the most boring places on Earth, so it\u2019s not uncommon for people to close their eyes and try to visualize a happier place. Trump closed his eyes from time to time, but I can definitively say he was never napping.\n\nI felt somewhat complicit in what was becoming a big lie.\n\nI guess I haven\u2019t had time to reflect on my conversation with Trump or my video\u2019s rise to fame. I\u2019m not voting for Trump, and my complete rejection of his political and social views remain intact.\n\nBut I will say this: He didn\u2019t have to speak to the random 22-year-old who tried to start a conversation with him nor did he have to praise the work of the clerk in the jury selection room.\n\nTomorrow, he\u2019ll go back to being a fire-breathing presidential candidate, but today he was just another New Yorker sitting in the jury room.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:44.068+0000"}

It\u2019s a big win for the deal\u2019s critics.\n\nIn the standoff with Congress over the Iranian nuclear deal, President Obama just blinked.\n\nFaced with the prospect of a backlash from members of Obama\u2019s own party on his signature foreign policy initiative, the White House on Monday said it\u2019d be willing to sign a bill that will prevent the administration from lifting sanctions on Iran while Congress reviews whatever final deal is reached with Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\nThe bill was passed unanimously, 19-0, by members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, of which declared Republican presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Rand Paul are members.\n\nNow the White House will have to submit to the very congressional scrutiny it had long sought to avoid. A former U.S. weapons negotiator told The Daily Beast that congressional inspection of the deal was a win for the deal\u2019s critics and could potentially upset further haggling over the fine print.\n\nThe bill, once signed, would also give lawmakers access to the full text of the deal as well as any classified information underlying it. The administration faces a deadline of June 30 to finalize the deal with Iran and the other five parties to the talks.\n\nSenator Bob Corker, the committee chairman, insisted that the White House had caved once it became clear that the bill was attracting enough support from Democrats that Congress could override a presidential veto. \u201cI know they\u2019ve relented because [of] what they believed to be the outcome here,\u201d Corker said during a hearing Monday. Later, in an exchange with reporters, Corker accused the White House of \u201cspinning\u201d by suggesting that recent modifications to the bill were significant and somehow didn\u2019t mean that the Congress would have a vote on sanctions relief.\n\n\u201cThis is the same piece of legislation that they\u2019ve always opposed and they are spinning you mightily,\u201d Corker said. \u201cIt\u2019s always been a vote on the sanctions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis bill had growing bipartisan support,\u201d Doug Stafford, the senior adviser to Paul, told The Daily Beast. Paul has been an advocate for congressional review. \u201cIt seems they may have recognized the reality that Congress was finally prepared to exercise their authority against executive overreach,\u201d Stafford said. \u201cCongress passed many of the sanctions by law. Only Congress should remove them.\u201d\n\nRubio, who declared his candidacy in Miami on Monday, has said that if he\u2019s elected, he\u2019ll scrap the Iran deal entirely.\n\n\u201cThis is the same piece of legislation that they\u2019ve always opposed and they are spinning you mightily\u2026 It\u2019s always been a vote on the sanctions.\u201d\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest had earlier framed the president\u2019s change of heart as the product of a difficult negotiation.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a piece of legislation that the president would veto to \u2026 a compromise that the president would be willing to sign,\u201d Earnest told reporters.\n\nEarnest added that the bill had undergone \u201csubstantial revisions.\u201d Yet it\u2019s unclear why those changes were \u201csubstantial\u201d enough to compel the White House to reverse course on its strategy of avoiding congressional review to the greatest possible extent.\n\nOne change to the bill now gives Congress 52 days to review the final agreement, instead of 60. But that still gives lawmakers plenty of time to have their say and potentially muck up the works. The White House would also now be freed from having to certify that Iran no longer supports terrorism. But the original legislation also didn\u2019t expressly tie that certification to the lifting of sanctions.\n\nBen Cardin, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s top Democrat and who\u2019d served as a bridge between Congress and the White House, said the administration had responded to changes in the legislation that he\u2019d pushed through.\n\n\u201cWe have, if anything, reinforced the president\u2019s ability to negotiate, and there will be no action taken by Congress on the substance of the agreements until we receive the agreements,\u201d Cardin told reporters.\n\nU.S. intelligence experts had earlier told The Daily Beast that they were pleasantly surprised by the initial agreement, which is paving the way to a final deal, that the U.S. and its partners struck with Iran in Switzerland this month. They noted that more details were put on paper than they\u2019d expected. They also said they saw more concessions from Iran than they thought were possible given that the talks had appeared headed toward a stalemate.\n\n\u201cI think that [the negotiators] were able to specify enough detail in this agreement to justify the effort to continue another three months and try to complete a comprehensive agreement,\u201d said Gary Samore, Obama\u2019s former coordinator for arms control.\n\nBut in the days after the agreement was reached, it became clear that the Iranian version of what the parties had agreed to differed in substantial ways from what the Americans were putting out in Washington. Chiefly in dispute was whether sanctions would be lifted as soon as Iran and the other parties reached a final agreement\u2014which is what Iran\u2019s leaders are now insisting must happen\u2014or if the Iranians would have to verify that they are complying with the specifics of a final deal before sanctions are eased in phases\u2014as the Obama administration has said is actually what the parties agreed.\n\nAmid the ambiguity, one thing was clear: The framework agreement reached in Switzerland was by no means a final deal, and there was still a lot of ground to cover before June 30. Now that Congress is going to have its turn, the nuclear drama looks to hang around well into the summer.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:44.293+0000"}
{"entityId": 1642, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "They weren\u2019t the most popular guys around Washington. But they all had Clinton\u2019s private email address. And boy, did they use it.\n\nAt 10:03 p.m. on June 23, 2009\u2014five months into Hillary Clinton\u2019s tenure as secretary of state\u2014she received an email from Sidney Blumenthal, her longtime, and long-controversial, confidant. The subject: \u201cHillary: If you\u2019re up, give me a call. Sid.\u201d\n\nDuring her early days in the Obama administration, newly released State Department emails show, Clinton received dozens of such messages on her private account from a motley, sycophantic crew of outside advisers\u2014many of whom carried significant baggage from past controversies.\n\nMark Penn, who abruptly resigned in April 2008 as Clinton\u2019s chief presidential campaign strategist, offered his opinions of Obama\u2019s Afghanistan strategy (or lack thereof). Lanny Davis, who counted dictators among his lobbying clients, asked Clinton to raise the issue of a Washington Times reporter held by the Iranians with the Greek foreign minister.\n\nBlumenthal emailed over and over and over again: He sent analysis on Iran, the latest gossip in the U.K., and advice on how to deal with Chinese disrespect for President Obama. At one point, Blumenthal apparently acted as a backchannel between Clinton and U.K. Prime Minister Gordon Brown.\n\nAt the same time, Clinton\u2019s emails from 2009 illustrate a strange disconnect from the White House she served: a canceled meeting at the White House, finding out about a Cabinet gathering on the radio\u2014and senior White House staff asking for her personal email address.\n\nOf course, the emails, released Tuesday night by the State Department, present just one window into Clinton\u2019s communications and interactions. (It\u2019s the second large-scale release of Clinton\u2019s emails, following the publication in May of hundreds of her communications on the 2012 attacks in Benghazi.) The documents only show declassified emails and exclude phone calls, meetings, and classified communications\u2014none of which we can see.\n\nBut that imperfect window reveals some odd things. Blumenthal, in particular, comes across as the foreign policy equivalent of a late-night drunk texter. The \u201cgive me a call\u201d email is one of many the moonlighting adviser fired off in 2009. Blumenthal sent that message in June, as Clinton was considering whether to bring him onto her State Department staff, an idea the White House eventually nixed. But that didn\u2019t stop the journalist and longtime Clinton loyalist from chiming in on myriad issues and personalities on which he purported to have insider knowledge.\n\nBlumenthal gave Clinton advice on what she ought to say on U.S. policy toward Iran. He passed her a laudatory opinion piece in Foreign Policy magazine, noting there \u201cwill likely soon be other analyses in the same vein as I am led to understand,\u201d without specifying his source.\n\nBlumenthal also pressed Clinton on how she should deal with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, and Irish politicians. And he dished gossipy tidbits he was picking up through his personal contacts in the British government.\n\nIn a May email, titled \u201cfrom rome... Sid,\u201d Blumenthal wrote, \u201cI also should relate to you when I return information about [U.K. Prime Minister Gordon] Brown government re foreign ministry.\u201d\n\nIn another email, Blumenthal updated Clinton on the U.K. results for the 2009 European Parliament election. In another, he wrote that \u201cit would seem proper and decent for the President to call Berlusconi to express his concern about his health and wish him a speedy recovery.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal apparently was eager to brag to strangers about how essential he was to the secretary of state. On June 5, 2009, State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley wrote Clinton to say Blumenthal had \u201couted himself\u201d about coming to work at the department during a conversation with an Associated Press reporter, \u201cmentioning it without realizing he was talking to someone who actually covers our building.\u201d\n\nMark Penn, Clinton\u2019s widely disliked 2008 campaign strategist, also offered his two cents on foreign policy from time to time.\n\nBlumenthal \u201couted himself\u201d about coming to work at the department during a conversation with an Associated Press reporter, \u201cmentioning it without realizing he was talking to someone who actually covers our building.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell if anyone is listening to Obama at [the United Nations] but the lack of clear Afghanistan policy is unwinding the coalition and threatens to cause a massive deer in headlights problem for administration if not resolved soon,\u201d he wrote in an email on Sept. 24, 2009.\n\nIn October of that year, Penn sent another email, this time criticizing Obama\u2019s action toward the Taliban, calling it \u201cpolitically\u2026quite dangerous.\u201d\n\nWhile Penn has managed a number of overseas political campaigns, his experience in matters of international security is thin. Yet he continued to opine.\n\n\u201cObama maintained througout [sic] the campaign and the start of his presidency that this is the one to fight and backing down here makes him and the administration vulnerable to losing moderate support and seeming weak and indecisive,\u201d he wrote Clinton. \u201cA single terrorist incident would be blamed on the admin. failing to do the job right.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s Lanny Davis, the Clinton ally for decades. He knew her at Yale Law and was the chief counsel who dealt with Whitewater and other Clinton tribulations in the 1990s.\n\nIn one email exchange, Davis reached out to Hillary on behalf of John Solomon, then editor of the Washington Times, who was trying to get help for a reporter being held by the Iranians. Davis noted before the request that Solomon had been \u201calways fair to us as AP reporter and later Wash Post reporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says Greeks have good relations and he believes they are trying to help. He believes you are meeting with Greek Foreign Minister tomorrow and hopes you can raise the issue with him - he may already know something about it,\u201d Davis wrote. \u201cAny information he knows would help family. Hope you can do this - And hope your elbow is better.\u201d\n\nClinton, in turn, sent an email to her State Department aide Jake Sullivan: \u201cWould you pls give Lanny a report and do you know who is keeping Solomon informed?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, the newly released communications also reveal a strange detachment between Clinton and the White House.\n\nIn June 2009, Clinton reached out to top aides about a supposed meeting at the White House. \u201cI heard on the radio that there is a Cabinet mtg this am,\u201d she emailed. \u201cIs there? Can I go? If not, who are we sending?\u201d Turns out there was no full Cabinet meeting.\n\nDays later, Clinton arrived at the White House and was told her meeting was canceled, the second time this had occurred.\n\n\u201cI arrived for the 10:15 mtg and was told there was no mtg,\u201d Clinton wrote in an exasperated email to senior aides. \u201cMatt said they had \u2018released\u2019 the time. This is the second time this has happened. What\u2019s up???\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only communication difficulty between the White House and Clinton. While many of Clinton\u2019s outside advisers had her private email, many of the top officials within the administration weren\u2019t able to reach her on it.\n\nIn June 2009, an aide emailed Clinton to say that White House aide David Axelrod was looking for her private address. In September, her chief of staff raised the same issue with Clinton regarding White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel.\n\n\u201cAxelrod wants your email - remind me to discuss with you if i forget,\u201d Cheryl Mills wrote in the subject line of an email to Clinton.\n\nThe emails indicate that famed diplomat Richard Holbrooke, the administration\u2019s point man on Afghanistan and Pakistan, did not have the same access to Clinton enjoyed by outside advisers like Blumenthal. Despite being the most prominent State Department official besides Clinton, it appears that Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s right-hand woman, was his main point of contact when trying to reach the secretary.\n\n\u201cDoes [Holbrooke] have an email address?\u201d Clinton asked an aide in November 2009, 11 months after they both joined the administration.\n\nWhen Clinton broke her elbow in the summer of 2009, both John Podesta and Colin Powell emailed her jokes about Holbrooke tripping her.\n\nPowell, former secretary of state and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote: \u201cHillary, Is it true that Holbrooke tripped you? Just kidding. Get better fast, we need you running around. Good being with you the other evening.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons even appeared to be somewhat reliant on gatekeepers when dealing with each other.\n\n\u201cIf u r still up, wjc landed in brazil for refuel,\u201d Abedin wrote Clinton in June 2009. \u201cHe should be on ground for an hour or so. Call dougs cell.\u201d\n\n\u201cI tried Doug twice but it went right to voice mail,\u201d Hillary responded at the end of the email chain. (The \u201cDoug\u201d in question is likely then-Bill Clinton aide Doug Band.)\n\nThe former president didn\u2019t even tell his wife when he became the U.N. special envoy to Haiti, instead conveying the news via Band. \u201cWjc said he was going to call hrc but hasn\u2019t had time,\u201d Band wrote to Abedin and Mills after the news of the appointment had already gone public.\n\nThere are also several emails arguing over the substance of the U.S. policy in Afghanistan, often filled with biting criticism and assertions the policy was, as one adviser wrote in a September 24, 2009, email, \u201cunwinding.\u201d\n\nLongtime Clinton advisers addressed efforts to get around the flailing government of then-Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai\u2014by working with Pakistan or striking some kind of deal with the Taliban.\n\nThe implication was they didn\u2019t trust the then newly re-elected president to solve Afghanistan\u2019s intractable problems.\n\nAnd even Clinton had trouble sorting out what the U.S. was supposed to say to Karzai. In a December 28, 2009, email from Clinton titled \u201cKarzai call?\u201d the secretary of state asks: \u201cWhat, if anything, was decided about whether I should call him? The email traffic I read has Holbrooke saying \u2018yes\u2019 and Frank R disagreeing. Can you update pls.\u201d\n\nBy then Obama had delivered a speech at West Point, New York, outlining the U.S. withdrawal plan from Afghanistan. In the email chain, no one has an answer for Clinton on whether she should call the U.S.-backed Karzai.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Jackie Kucinich, Nancy A.

As a national politician trying to contest Florida, Huckabee needed a Cuban American to act as a human shield for criticism of his flip-flop.\n\nFar less clear, however, is what Rubio got out of the deal. Top-tier Republican candidates had courted him, but Rubio had rebuffed them. Even then, it was puzzling.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s a nice Cuban-American boy like Rubio doing hanging out with these characters?\u201d wrote Ana Menendez, a columnist for The Miami Herald, after the 2007 endorsement. \u201cWhat\u2019s [Huckabee\u2019s] appeal to the traditional Cuban-American voter? Until recently, Huckabee didn\u2019t think the embargo was a good idea: It hurt Arkansas\u2019 rice farmers.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Rubio said he was convinced on the basis of Huckabee\u2019s sincerity and staunch stance on abortion.\n\n\u201cI want the Republican Party to be the party of life and family, and Mike Huckabee is the best candidate on those issues,\u201d Rubio said during the endorsement on Dec. 11, 2007, according to the Tampa Bay Times.\n\nBut one former Rubio aide explained the endorsement as a political calculation on the part of the then-Florida House speaker. At the time, Rubio was on his way out of the speakership, and he was looking to have a greater presence on the national scene. He would get more of a return with Huckabee, more so than with Fred Thompson or Rudy Giuliani or Mitt Romney or John McCain.\n\n\u201cThat was an endorsement really where they had nothing to lose, especially Marco,\u201d the aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt was more of an introductory move to get his foot in the door. Back then Marco was really pitching his conservative values, and it mirrored where Huckabee was\u2026 It just elevated him a little bit, elevated himself on the national scene. If Huckabee had legs, [Rubio] would have had a pretty big presence.\u201d\n\nPerhaps Rubio also saw a version of himself in Huckabee, who also grew up in poverty. Rubio praised Huckabee in January 2008 as \u201ca guy who is one generation removed from dirt floors and outdoor plumbing.\u201d\n\nThe Florida senator himself is the son of a bartender and a maid, a point he highlighted during his campaign launch in April.\n\nMike Haridopolos, who was serving in the Florida legislature in 2007 as the Senate majority whip, said Rubio also admired Huckabee\u2019s ability to relate to a crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat attracted us both was [Huckabee\u2019s] ability to communicate,\u201d said Haridopolos, who will be supporting Huckabee again in the coming election cycle. \u201cThe positive nature of Huckabee\u2019s campaign, for building people up rather than tearing people down\u2014those were the discussions Marco and I had.\u201d\n\nHuckabee eventually came in fourth during the Florida GOP primary, but not before he did a little obligatory pandering in state: at Versailles restaurant, a staple for local politics in Miami, the former governor who once opposed the Cuban embargo tied the \u201cmurder\u201d of abortion to Castro\u2019s dictatorship.\n\nLater, Huckabee would endorse Rubio for Senate in the 2010 election.

Now they have to kill the law\u2019s most hysterical provisions for good.\n\nHowever short the current reprieve from three expired and generally useless provisions in the Patriot Act turns out to be, this much seems certain: It\u2019s going to take a solid Republican majority to toss out the most hysterical aspects of post-9/11 lawmaking.\n\nThis makes a certain amount of intuitive sense, even if it means it\u2019s going to be a tough fight to give the current version of the surveillance state a final heave-ho. Only Richard Nixon, who made his bones as an Alger Hiss-baiting anti-communist, could go to Red China, and only the Democratic Party, which had long been home to segregationist politicians, could make the final push on civil rights legislation in the 1960s.\n\nAlthough the Patriot Act was passed by overwhelmingly bipartisan votes when the Trade Center was still a steaming mass of wreckage in Lower Manhattan, the law is rightly understood as an essentially Republican piece of legislation that sailed through a majority Republican House and Senate and was signed by a Republican president.\n\nAs important, the Democrats put up effectively no fight against the Patriot Act, either out of fear of going against the zeitgeist in the weeks after the 9/11 attacks or sincere conviction that the Patriot Act was absolutely necessary. (That no one read the bill before it passed makes it difficult to draw any conclusions that speak well about members of either party.) A couple of years later, the Democrats pulled the same spineless trick with Iraq, where more Democrats supported the 2003 invasion than did the 1991 action put together by Bush I after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.\n\nAs liberal national security state supporters such as Dianne Feinstein only too happily illustrate, whatever Democrats may believe about civil liberties doesn\u2019t get in the way of voting for security over freedom whenever the opportunity presents itself. Barack Obama might have campaigned as a critic of the Patriot Act, but it was his CIA director, John Brennan, this past weekend who was pushing for reauthorization of bulk collection of telephone metadata, roving wiretaps, and the \u201clone wolf\u201d provision, which allows law enforcement to track suspects unaffiliated with any known terrorist group or foreign power. Recently sworn-in Attorney General Loretta Lynch couldn\u2019t even announce corruption charges against FIFA members without calling for re-upping on those Patriot Act provisions, too.\n\nSo it falls to Republicans to clean up the mess they did so much to create. To their credit, they are doing exactly that, even as they fight among themselves over the details. On the one hand, you\u2019ve got wracked-with-guilt characters such as James Sensenbrenner, the Wisconsin representative who introduced the Patriot Act in 2001 and who\u2019s been denouncing the way the government has implemented the legislation. In 2013, only after Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations and a long history of protecting the Patriot Act from any sort of congressional criticism, Sensenbrenner finally flipped and wrote Attorney General Eric Holder that the National Security Agency\u2019s request for Verizon records was \u201cnot consistent with the requirements of the Patriot Act.\u201d\n\nThe Patriot Act should never have passed in the first place, so it\u2019s good to see the Republicans openly discussing how to whittle it down to something that might fit within defensible practice.\n\nSensenbrenner introduced the USA Freedom Act, which reforms parts of the Patriot Act, most obviously by changing how the feds can search for metadata. The bill sailed through the House, even as hard-core Republican firebrands such as Michigan\u2019s Justin Amash voted against it, saying it still gives too much power to the surveillance state. In the Senate, Tea Party favorites Mike Lee and Ted Cruz led the charge in favor of the legislation. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was pushing for a straight-up reauthorization of the Patriot Act, which went nowhere after Rand Paul\u2014joined by Ron Wyden, the only Democrat who spoke during Paul\u2019s epic 2013 filibuster against Brennan\u2019s confirmation vote\u2014ran out the clock on the Senate\u2019s session last week.\n\nOn Sunday, Paul got his wish, which was to see the Patriot Act provisions governing bulk collections, roving wiretaps, and \u201clone wolves\u201d expire even as he conceded that the USA Freedom Act \u201cwill ultimately pass\u201d and thus restore versions of the same.\n\nBut the debate within the Republican Party is still important, even if most of the outcome is symbolic in the near term. Mass opposition to a clean reauthorization of the Patriot Act is a clear sign that we are coming out of the 9/11-induced fog that allowed for way too much trust being placed in the hands of the government.\n\nWe\u2019ve watched officials in both the Bush and Obama administrations lie to the public about what was going on, and we\u2019ve seen the FBI itself admit that Section 215 has proved incredibly useless in fighting terrorism and that the \u201clone wolf\u201d provision has never been used.\n\nThe Patriot Act should never have passed in the first place, so it\u2019s good to see the Republicans openly discussing how to whittle it down to something that might fit within defensible practice. As Ohio State\u2019s John Mueller has written, laws and practices put into place during national security emergencies tend to last for decades, even when the threat has receded or been unmasked as mostly illusory. In 1972, Mueller and co-author Mark G. Stewart note, \u201cthe FBI opened 65,000 new files as part of its costly quest to ferret out Communists in the United States. The pursuit died out only when international Communism collapsed at the end of the Cold War.\u201d\n\nIn this sense, then, the intra-Republican debate over the Patriot Act, including the reformist USA Freedom Act, shows we are moving into a new and, one hopes, more reality-based discussion of countering terrorist threats to America. The USA Freedom Act may well be similar to the legislation it will supplant, but at the very least it\u2019s a step in the right direction. And compared to other examples of laws and practices that stick around long after the threat that birthed them no longer matters, we\u2019re practically moving at warp speed.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:45.511+0000"}

But \u201cwhat no one wants to say out loud is that this is a big win for the NSA,\u201d one former top spook says.\n\nCivil libertarians and privacy advocates were applauding yesterday after the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed legislation to stop the National Security Agency from collecting Americans\u2019 phone records. But they\u2019d best not break out the bubbly.\n\nThe really big winner here is the NSA. Over at its headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, intelligence officials are high-fiving, because they know things could have turned out much worse.\n\n\u201cWhat no one wants to say out loud is that this is a big win for the NSA, and a huge nothing burger for the privacy community,\u201d said a former senior intelligence official, one of half a dozen who have spoken to The Daily Beast about the phone records program and efforts to change it.\n\nHere\u2019s the dirty little secret that many spooks are loath to utter publicly, but have been admitting in private for the past two years: The program, which was exposed in documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013, is more trouble than it\u2019s worth.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very expensive and very cumbersome,\u201d the former official said. It requires the agency to maintain huge databases of all Americans\u2019 landline phone calls. But it doesn\u2019t contribute many leads on terrorists. It has helped prevent few\u2014if any\u2014attacks. And it\u2019s nowhere near the biggest contributor of information about terrorism that ends up on the desk of the president and other senior decision makers.\n\nIf, after the most significant public debate about balancing surveillance and liberty in a generation, this is the program that the NSA has to give up, they\u2019re getting off easy.\n\nThe bill that the House passed yesterday, called the USA Freedom Act, doesn\u2019t actually suspend the phone records program. Rather, it requires that phone companies, not the NSA, hold on to the records.\n\n\u201cGood! Let them take them. I\u2019m tired of holding on to this,\u201d a current senior U.S. official told The Daily Beast. It requires teams of lawyers and auditors to ensure that the NSA is complying with Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which authorizes the program, as well as internal regulations on how the records can and can\u2019t be used, he said. The phone records program has become a political lightning rod, the most controversial of all the classified operations that Snowden exposed. If the NSA can still get access to the records but not have to hold on to them itself, all the better, the senior official said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big win for common sense and for the country,\u201d Joel Brenner, the NSA\u2019s former inspector general, told The Daily Beast. \u201cNSA can get to do what it needs to do with a higher level of scrutiny and a little more trouble, but it can do what needs to do. At same time the government is not going to hold the bulk metadata of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat no one wants to say out loud is that this is a big win for the NSA, and a huge nothing burger for the privacy community.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe NSA is coming out of this unscathed,\u201d said the former official. If the USA Freedom Act passes the Senate\u2014which is not a foregone conclusion\u2014it\u2019ll be signed by President Obama and create \u201ca more efficient and comprehensive tool\u201d for the NSA. That\u2019s because under the current regime, only the logs of landline calls are kept. But in the future, the NSA would be able to get cell phone records from the companies, too.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s great,\u201d the former official said. \u201cI think no one thought it was in the realm of the possible before this bill.\u201d\n\nAnd there\u2019s another irony. Before the Snowden leaks, the NSA was already looking for alternatives to storing huge amounts of phone records in the agency\u2019s computers. And one of the ideas officials considered was asking Congress to require phone companies to hang onto that information for several years. The idea died, though, because NSA leaders thought that Congress would never agree, current and former officials have said.\n\nEnter Snowden. Suddenly the NSA found itself under orders from the White House to come up with some alternative to the phone records program that preserved it as a counterterrorism tool, but also put more checks on how the records are used. That\u2019s when General Keith Alexander, then the agency\u2019s director, dusted the old idea off the shelf and promoted it on Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cThe USA Freedom Act\u201d\u2014the supposed reining in of the NSA\u2014\u201cwas literally born from Alexander,\u201d the former official said.\n\nSo the NSA effectively got what it wanted. But that doesn\u2019t mean privacy activists got nothing, or that they\u2019d count the law\u2019s passage as a loss.\n\nConsider their significant victories. Before Snowden, the NSA was secretly collecting records on hundreds of millions of Americans, a program that some members of Congress didn\u2019t even understand they were voting for when they renewed the Patriot Act, and that an appeals court ruled last week is illegal. Now the world knows what the agency exposed hundreds of millions of innocent people to potential scrutiny.\n\n\u201cThese are reforms NSA ultimately was prepared to accept; it\u2019s not as though the agency had been secretly wishing for these changes all along and was finally able to get them only now,\u201d Julian Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, told The Daily Beast. \u201cSo it seems a little odd to call it a \u2018win\u2019 for them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut,\u201d Sanchez continued, \u201cI\u2019d certainly agree it\u2019s not a loss for NSA in any meaningful way. Indeed, there are some respects in which a shift to the carrier-centric model is likely to give them greater flexibility by allowing them to query on data the FISC order doesn\u2019t permit them to collect.\u201d For instance, billing addresses, which the NSA database doesn\u2019t have now, but that the phone companies could, in principle, provide.\n\nThe FISC is the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which has been secretly authorizing the program for years. Under the new law, the NSA would have to get court approval to query the phone records. That adds another layer of oversight to the intelligence operations, but it doesn\u2019t suspend them. And there\u2019s no guarantee it would curtail them, either. The court has repeatedly found that the phone records program is legal. Presumably it\u2019s not going to stop granting NSA\u2019s requests just because the records now sit in an AT&T database instead of one owned by the U.S. government.\n\n\u201cThe NSA is coming out of this unscathed... No one thought it was in the realm of the possible.\u201d\n\nBut the NSA is not out of the woods, because surveillance critics don\u2019t see the USA Freedom Act as the last chapter. \u201cThe only downside for privacy advocates would be if the passage of this bill were invoked to claim we\u2019ve now accomplished \u2018surveillance reform\u2019 and there\u2019s no work left to be done,\u201d Sanchez said.\n\nNow, advocates will turn their sights on another controversial portion of surveillance law, Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That\u2019s what lets the NSA collect email and other electronic data from big tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Yahoo, including under the so-called Prism program that was the subject of the second big leak from Snowden.\n\nThat program does provide the NSA with a huge amount of information. According to intelligence officials, it\u2019s the single largest source of intelligence included in the president\u2019s daily national security briefing. And it also allows the NSA to collect large amounts of global communications as they course through equipment in the United States.\n\nTake those authorities away, and it\u2019d be like putting out one of the NSA\u2019s eyes. Section 702 is slated to sunset in 2017. If members of Congress and privacy activists mount an effort to restrict or repeal those authorities, the NSA will go to the barricades to stop them.\n\nBut that\u2019s another day. For now, the NSA is taking its lumps, and thanking its lucky stars.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:45.680+0000"}
{"entityId": 1646, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Clinton is slipping with female voters, providing an opening for Republicans. Can any of them exploit it\u2014or are they just too extreme?\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign continues to dominate headlines and airtime thanks in part to his controversial comments about women, from Megyn Kelly to Rosie O\u2019Donnell. But that doesn\u2019t change one fact: Almost no one actually believes Donald Trump has a chance at winning the nomination or the presidency.\n\nWith new polls showing Hillary Clinton\u2019s support slipping with female voters, there is a clear opening for the GOP. The question is which Republican candidate has the best shot at seizing the opportunity\u2014despite the gender train-wreck that Trump\u2019s candidacy has been so far?\n\nWhile it has been treated as somewhat of a given that Hillary Clinton would easily win female voters, history has proven the reality to be much more complicated. For starters, Clinton has a complicated relationship with female voters. Most female candidates do.\n\nGoing back to her husband\u2019s 1992 campaign when she made her infamous \u201ccookies\u201d crack, which was perceived as a slight to stay-at-home mothers, women have tended to be divided about Clinton. She lost the women\u2019s vote in early primary states Iowa and South Carolina to Barack Obama. A potential challenge for a Clinton\u2019s current campaign is that a January poll found that while 69 percent of Democratic women said it is important to see a female president in their lifetime, only 20 percent of Republican women said the same.\n\n\u201cBeing a woman does not give you the right to be the next president,\u201d said Republican strategist Susan Del Percio in a phone interview. \u201cWhether you\u2019re Carly Fiorina or Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s going to be your campaign that matters.\u201d\n\nAnd at the moment, Clinton\u2019s campaign is being weighed down by an email server scandal, which seems to be affecting her poll numbers. A new Wall Street Journal poll has found that her favorability with white female voters declined by 10 percent in one month. Del Percio and another Republican strategist, Cheri Jacobus, both predicted that Clinton\u2019s slip could provide an opening for a candidate like Ohio Governor John Kasich.\n\nThough a late entrant to the race, and therefore not enjoying the coverage that some other candidates are, Kasich appears to be one of the GOP\u2019s best hopes for winning female voters\u2014across party and racial lines \u2014in a general election. As governor of Ohio, one of the most important presidential battleground states in the nation, his previous campaigns should be considered a decent indicator of his appeal to different types of American voters\u2014and exit polls for his 2014 re-election indicate he appeals to female voters in a major way. He won 60 percent of female voters, including 71 percent of white female voters.\n\nAlso likely to help his case was his recent debate performance. While other candidates generated more airtime and attention, Kasich turned in a solid performance that displayed compassion on issues such as poverty and even same-sex marriage, and most important, avoided any controversial statements likely to be used in an attack ad later. Not all of the other candidates can say the same.\n\nWhile Trump has been most widely criticized for alienating women with his debate performance, Clinton has made clear she believes he\u2019s not the only one. She took aim at Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who had what many considered a stellar performance in the debate. Clinton said: \u201cWhen one of their major candidates, a much younger man, the senator from Florida, says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest, that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeing a woman does not give you the right to be the next president. Whether you\u2019re Carly Fiorina or Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s going to be your campaign that matters.\u201d\n\nClinton is right in theory. Polls have consistently shown that a large majority of Americans (more than 70 percent), including women, support access to legal and safe abortion in cases of rape or incest.\n\nWhat is less clear is how many women actually vote on this issue. Just because someone believes abortion should not be illegal does not mean it will ultimately determine her final vote. Furthermore, unlike the 2012 election in which birth control coverage was the leading reproductive rights debate, the controversy surrounding the recent Planned Parenthood videos could impact casual pro-choicers. In other words, if someone is technically pro-choice, but considers it a second- or third-tier issue, then the Planned Parenthood videos combined with a likable and non-extreme pro-life candidate could shake up the election.\n\nDel Percio, the Republican strategist, said that at the end of the day it is highly unlikely reproductive rights will define this election. She did say, however, that candidates perceived as too extreme may alienate women and named Texas senator Ted Cruz as likely too conservative to gain traction with women nationwide.\n\nCruz is not the only one who may face an uphill climb. During the debate Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker refused to articulate an exception to his opposition to abortion when a mother\u2019s life is at stake. Even women who do not define themselves as reproductive rights voters will likely find it tough to vote for someone who believes he has the right to decide if they should live or die when faced with a challenging or dangerous pregnancy. Mike Huckabee talked about sidestepping the Supreme Court\u2019s authority on the issue, which also may raise flags among voters. Governor Kasich, in contrast, is on the record as pro-life but also as believing in exceptions in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother.\n\nFormer governor Jeb Bush seems to be a bit more of a wild card. He tied his Democratic opponent in total female voters during his 1998 election, but won white female voters by a sizable margin, 56 to 43 percent. He has been among the most aggressive critics of Trump\u2019s rhetoric on women, being the first GOP candidate to call on Trump to apologize, and going further by expressing concern Trump will hurt the party with women. But it is unclear how much his clumsy comment that \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues,\u201d will haunt him.\n\nIf Bush, a policy-heavy, business-minded, corporate-friendly, establishment candidate stumbles, then that leaves an opening for another business-minded, corporate-friendly, establishment candidate, Carly Fiorina. Thanks to her winning performance in the pre-debate debate, voters and media are taking another look at the only female GOP presidential candidate.\n\nRepublican strategist Jacobus emphasized that Fiorina is on an upswing because of her performance in recent weeks, \u201cnot because of her gender.\u201d But with her newfound success comes newfound scrutiny. The former executive is facing criticism from some women for her opposition to a federal mandate for paid maternity leave. Fiorina has no biological children of her own.\n\nThere hasn\u2019t been the same outcry regarding male candidates\u2019 maternity- or paternity-leave positions. Which just goes to show that whether your name is Hillary Clinton or Carly Fiorina, often times women voters can be the toughest crowd when you\u2019re a woman running for office.\n\nThe other takeaway may be this: With every step closer toward women\u2019s equality, defining what constitutes \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d that matter to all women will get harder and harder and that means figuring out how to win the so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s vote\u201d will keep getting harder for both parties.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:45.827+0000"}

Her daughter wasn\u2019t getting adequate dental treatment, she wrote, and she was in excruciating pain.\n\nThen she emails James Crosby, the secretary of the Department of Corrections.\n\n\u201cThe Govenor sd he was going to look into the matter & NOTHING was done at all,\u201d she writes. \u201cI\u2019m sure something would have been done if it was his daughter!\u201d\n\nCrosby\u2019s response sounds chagrined. They sent her daughter to a dentist, he wrote, they checked up on her medical care, they have a new warden for the institution, and they\u2019ve had higher-ups check on the institution\u2019s work programs.\n\nPlus, he notes, only three women ever asked to be taken out of the program that Buchholz describes as so nightmarish.\n\n\u201cSince her arrival on December 19, 2003, at Lowell CI, you have sent 71 e-mails to me and 3 to medical,\u201d Crosby wrote. \u201cAt your request, we have transferred her three times over a six month period, and again have a pending transfer to work release. A review of your requests and my responses show a significant amount of personal attention on the part of many has been taken to try and ensure Dawn is both appropriately cared for and that she is offered every opportunity.\u201d\n\nBuchholz\u2019s next email to Bush was totally different, and crushingly human. The subject line is \u201capologize,\u201d and she was sorry.\n\n\u201cSometimes she\u2019s like a little girl so helpless & I get too protective like an animal if somone comes near her babies,\u201d she writes. \u201cI want you to know I feel for all these women & would also fight like crazy if I heard someone was hurting your daughter. That could be me in there & I never forget that. I will not bother you two men again but will ALWAYS remember the two of you as good men in a crazy world.\u201d\n\nFlorida\u2019s character- and faith-based prisons\u2014like the one that held Buchholz\u2019s daughter\u2014is one of the success stories from his tenure as governor that Bush will likely cite on the campaign trail, should he decide to run.\n\nAt the New Hampshire First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit last weekend, literature handed out by Bush\u2019s Right to Rise PAC listed the faith-based prisons among a smorgasbord of his conservative accomplishments.\n\n\u201cTo foster the rehabilitation of inmates, Governor Bush also opened the nation's first entirely faith-based prison at Lawtey Correctional Institution in North Florida,\u201d his PAC trumpets.\n\nThat\u2019s a pretty loaded sentence, as the mother above understood. There\u2019s debate about whether these programs actually fostered rehabilitation, and they also drew substantial criticism and legal challenges for being too intertwined with religious faith.\n\nAnd Bush\u2019s record on criminal justice issues could present challenges for him on the campaign trail, since it\u2019s hard to distill into a handy talking point. But it could also bring interesting opportunities.\n\nIn 2003, Bush signed legislation to have some prisons and prison dormitories take on entirely faith- and character-based programming and to have a massive influx of unpaid volunteers\u2014most of whom came from churches near the prisons\u2014pour into the facilities to teach and mentor prisoners.\n\nThese volunteers provided free labor, which saved the state a substantial chunk of money. And the programs, still in place, seem popular.\n\nA 2009 report from the state\u2019s Office of Program Analysis and Government Accountability said there were 8,890 inmates on a waiting list to get into the institution-based programs (or the programs that encompass entire prisons) and another 1,600 waiting to get into character- and faith-based dorms.\n\nVicki Lopez, who chaired the governor\u2019s Ex-Offender Task Force, said the new prison programming had a dramatic impact on incarcerated people\u2019s quality of life.\n\n\u201cThere was this notion that redemption was possible, and I believe Governor Bush absolutely believes that,\u201d she said.\n\nShe even heard from prison guards who said the new environment had begun to change them.\n\nAllison DeFoor, who chairs Florida State University\u2019s Project on Accountable Justice, is an Episcopal priest and volunteer prison chaplain at the Wakulla Correctional Institution.\n\nDeFoor said the faith- and character-based programming makes the prison feel calm and sane.\n\n\u201cIt is unlike any prison I\u2019ve ever been in my life,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a profoundly different place\u2014with the exception of Lawtey.\u201d\n\nHe added that levels of violence and tension are far lower than in conventional prisons.\n\n\u201cYou can feel it in the air,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, because of the volunteer involvement, these programs cost the state nothing.\n\nBut they\u2019ve highlighted some of the larger, systemic problems that Bush was unable to fix. Budget cuts, for example, hit prisons hard.\n\nMany Florida prisons didn\u2019t (and still don\u2019t) have air conditioning. Lopez recalled walking into a conventional prison dorm without air conditioning that housed pregnant women.\n\n\u201cIt looked like something out of the old South,\u201d she said.\n\nThat wouldn\u2019t have happened in a faith- and character-based prison, she added, because volunteers often become outspoken advocates for prisoners.\n\nAnd DeFoor noted that making larger policy changes\u2014like sentencing rules that can give nonviolent offenders lengthy terms\u2014is incredibly difficult. Florida\u2019s tough-on-crime culture means prisons get short-circuited when the budget is getting written and that convicted criminals get lengthy, onerous sentences. So while it\u2019s politically painless to get volunteers into prisons, it proved formidable to shorten nonviolent offenders\u2019 time there.\n\n\u201cOn the front end, which is sentencing reform, that was very difficult in Florida, and it remains highly difficult,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cThe state has always been known as \u2018hard on crime.\u2019\u201d\n\nChanging Florida\u2019s affinity for jam-packed prisons isn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cThe system wants more prisoners,\u201d DeFoor said. \u201cDon\u2019t kid yourself. The cultural ethos of the corrections system is to grow.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact that Bush wasn\u2019t able to change that ethos may be an issue for him on the campaign trail. In his first year as governor he signed a bill that increased some mandatory minimum sentencing requirements for juvenile offenders.\n\nIt will present a particularly sharp contrast with Rick Perry, the outspoken, gun-totin\u2019 former Texas governor who signed off on sweeping criminal justice reforms that reduced recidivism rates, shuttered a handful of prisons, and saved the state a bunch of money.\n\n(Not to mention contenders like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky), was has advocated for changing the mandatory minimum sentencing for nonviolent offenders on the federal level.)\n\nPerry\u2019s reforms paved the way for other states to focus on being smart about crime, instead of merely tough.\n\n\u201cAt some point, we have to say \u2018Enough is enough\u2019 to young people who are dangerously out of control,\u201d he said at the time, per the Sun Sentinel.\n\nSo, while Bush\u2019s reforms showed that prison didn\u2019t have to be as bad as it was\u2014they also show his limits as a reformer.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:46.155+0000"}
{"entityId": 1648, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "George W. Bush was able to successfully show us where he split with his dad. The future of Jeb\u2019s candidacy depends on his ability to pull off a similar trick.\n\nA while back, my friend and boss, Tucker Carlson, refused to condemn his brother for some inappropriate comments that were accidentally made public. \u201cYou know what, if my brother committed a mass murder, I would not criticize him in public,\u201d Carlson later explained. \u201cHe\u2019s my brother. Period. Under no circumstances will I criticize my family in public\u2014ever. That\u2019s the rule, and I\u2019m not breaking it.\u201d\n\nAs an only child, I can\u2019t fully identify with this fraternal loyalty. But I respect the hell out of it. It\u2019s a dangerous world, and if your brother doesn\u2019t have your back, who will? But there are consequences to adhering to this sort of code. And right now, Jeb Bush is finding out that his reluctance to publicly criticize and break with his brother could potentially doom his presidential bid.\n\nOn Thursday he finally pulled the trigger and stated the obvious: No, he now says, he wouldn\u2019t have invaded Iraq given what we know now. It was an important moment in his campaign. It was also flat-footed\u2014his fourth answer to the question in a week\u2014and probably didn\u2019t go far enough. But it had to be said.\n\nIn the last 48 hours or so, we\u2019ve seen Ted Cruz, Chris Christie, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson, and John Kasich all say that\u2014knowing what we know now\u2014the war was a mistake. And, of course, Rand Paul has been pushing this line all along (without need of the \u201cknowing what we know now\u201d caveat). Jeb lagged far behind the rest of the field on what should have been an easy question.\n\nBut of course\u2014because the man who ordered the invasion was his brother\u2014Jeb finds himself in a unique situation. And so, he spent several news cycles failing to adequately answer a serous question about what might be the most important foreign policy decision of the early 21st century.\n\nJeb\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m my own man\u201d act was, of course, never going to fly. Not without proof. And it wouldn\u2019t have flown for Dubya, either, even though his father\u2014the last Republican president (you always have to distance yourself from the last guy)\u2014wasn\u2019t as much of an albatross in 2000 as W. is today. In fact, a big part of the reason Dubya succeeded is that he broke with his dad, who still had a toxic reputation on the right, what with the tax hike and the disdain for \u201cvoodoo economics\u201d and the losing to Bill Clinton.\n\nPoppy made his bones in the GOP as a pro-choice moderate, an ally of Nixon and Ford; George W. ran as the personification of the religious right.\n\nIn all theater, including politics, the first rule is Show, don\u2019t tell. And George W. Bush didn\u2019t just tell us he was different; he showed us he was different. He spoke differently. He wasn\u2019t a WASP from the Northeast; he was a born-again evangelical from Texas. \u201cThere is a higher father that I appeal to,\u201d he once told Bob Woodward. Poppy made his bones in the GOP as a pro-choice moderate, an ally of Nixon and Ford; George W. ran as the personification of the religious right.\n\nAnd guess what? It worked. George W. Bush managed to get elected and, unlike his dad, re-elected. In one fell swoop, Dubya avenged his father\u2019s defeat at the hands of Bill Clinton\u2014by simultaneously disowning his father. Jeb\u2019s reluctance to make a similar break with his brother\u2019s legacy cost him dearly this week, and despite his comments on Thursday, it will dog him for months.\n\nGranted, what Dubya pulled off was a difficult trick. Despite sending the aforementioned signals to everyone that he would be more like Reagan than his own old man, he never completely threw Poppy under the bus. In fact, it was pretty clear that he loved his dad, even as he surrounded himself with Poppy\u2019s old enemies like Don Rumsfeld. And then, just as he would do what his dad couldn\u2019t do electorally, he would also finish the job in Baghdad.\n\nNot to play Maureen Dowd pop psychologist here, but how much of the last few decades can be explained by the psychological need to avenge George H.W. Bush\u2019s presidency\u2014not by means of revisionist history, but by means of reliving it \u2026 getting it right this time?\n\nThe irony, of course, is that 41 did a good job of winding down the Cold War and effectively neutering Saddam. As you\u2019ll recall, H.W. Bush managed to assemble an impressive coalition, and refused to get bogged down in some quagmire. But no good deed goes unpunished. He wins a war, and some lecherous hillbilly from Arkansas takes his job? And to add insult to injury, Saddam tried to have Poppy assassinated.\n\nSo here you have this interesting psychology whereby George W. Bush is willing to publicly distance himself from dear old dad, do things dad wouldn\u2019t approve of, in order to avenge him. This would be fascinating enough, were it not for John Ellis Bush.\n\nAnother weird twist to this story is that Jeb, always the favorite son, is probably more like 41 than 43 in temperament and outlook. And maybe that means that, had Jeb been elected president in 2000, instead of his brother, he wouldn\u2019t have gotten us involved in the Iraq War, while he simultaneously lacks the killer instinct to tell us that. Maybe\u2014just as 41 had the governing skills, but lacked the political instincts that might have made him a two-term president\u2014Jeb Bush is just too decent a guy to get elected.\n\nBut here\u2019s the bottom line: Jeb has to really distance himself from his brother, albeit in some respectable manner, if he wants to be president. He needs to show us how he\u2019s different, what he\u2019d do differently, and where he and his brother diverge on issues both foreign and domestic. Where does he stand on the bailouts, the massive growth in government spending, the Medicare expansion, and all the other facets of the Bush presidency that still anger conservatives? He has to make a break with all that if he wants to make it to the nomination and, ultimately, the White House.\n\nThis insanely difficult choice\u2014whether to stay with his brother or leave him behind\u2014will largely define Jeb\u2019s candidacy. The Bushes have always prized loyalty, but for Jeb, absolute loyalty to his brother\u2014and winning the presidency\u2014might be mutually exclusive. Some presidents would run over their own mother if that\u2019s what it takes to win an election. What is Jeb willing to say about his brother\u2019s policies\u2014if push comes to shove?", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:46.799+0000"}

For shame.\n\nBush framed his tax-return-dumping as a gesture of openness and goodwill.\n\n\u201cOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income,\u201d Jeb Bush wrote.\n\n\u201cYou might remember a few months back, in the spirit of transparency, I posted 280,000 emails from my time as governor on JebEmails.com,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome of them were funny, some serious, some a little embarrassing. But I put them all out because I wanted people to have a window into my leadership style and be able to see for themselves how I handled the issues facing our state.\u201d\n\nNevermind that under Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law those emails were already public record.\n\nAnyway, Bush\u2019s release of 1,150 pages of tax returns is explicitly designed to burnish his transparency credentials.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also given him a chance to ding the U.S. tax code.\n\n\u201cI just came back from Estonia where it takes residents less than five minutes to file their taxes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe tax release process sure would\u2019ve been a lot easier if we were following the Estonia model.\u201d\n\nBush also used the moment to tout his business experience.\n\nAnother graph shows that his business grew from 3 to 250 employees, and depicts that change in a chart, in case you have trouble getting your mind around the difference between those two figures.\n\nBush gave a very cursory description of the work he did between his governorship gig and presidential bid.\n\nHe mentioned, for instance, that he worked as a senior adviser to Barclay\u2019s, a multinational bank based in Britain. But he didn\u2019t mention that before taking that gig, he became an adviser to Lehman Brothers, as Bloomberg noted last December.\n\nOmitting Lehman\u2019s from his e-resume makes sense, given its connection to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\n\nA few hours after Bush\u2019s tax returns come out, the State Department will release a trove of emails Clinton sent while serving as Secretary of State.

So why even bother with this very strange ritual of staged chats and photo-ops?\n\nRunning for president frequently involves the unnatural pursuit of the natural. It\u2019s like trying to choose a spouse through the Miss America Pageant or The Bachelor. How do you begin to get a sense of what someone is really like through an oddly ritualized process that seems to inevitably embarrass everyone?\n\nWhy do we this? Why do we force candidates to try to look natural when engaged in activities that are preposterously ridiculous? There\u2019s Hillary Clinton sitting in a neighborhood coffee shop talking to three young Iowans\u2014watched by a media \u201cpool\u201d who are just a small percentage of the huge media flock trailing the former Secretary of State. Yes, talking to young voters can be casual and natural; so can having sex. But when it happens on the fifty-yard line of the Homecoming game, it becomes a different sort of thing. And then, of course, the \u201cyoung voters\u201d aren\u2019t really \u201cregular\u201d voters but Democratic party activists who have been carefully vetted and driven to the events like, well, talent. Which is what they are.\n\nWho\u2019s being fooled by these most insincere attempts at sincerity? The press surely knows it\u2019s ridiculous. Does anyone really believe that a single Iowan sees this on television and thinks, \u201cOh, how nice, Mrs. Clinton just happened to be having coffee with these young people.\u201d\n\nPlease. This is one of the most sophisticated political markets in America. So many presidential candidates have spent serious time in Iowa that if you don\u2019t have a picture of you and a future president hanging in your living room, John Edwards can probably file a discrimination suit on your behalf.\n\nBut phony as they are, we\u2019re likely to see many variations of the Hillary coffee shop moment repeated by other candidates, though it\u2019s doubtful that many will be as staged as to recruit and vet the participants.\n\nI\u2019m sympathetic to the instinct. The one thing a campaign does control\u2014in theory\u2014are events of its own planning and execution. Inevitably there is a natural human tendency to try to over-control that which you think you can. Campaigns are a study in controlled chaos. On any given day, a campaign is likely to be dealing with some wacky or worse thing a supporter has said, economic numbers that could be good or bad depending on the spin, any number of angry news outlets who feel they haven\u2019t been treated fairly and probably an equal or greater number the campaign believes has treated it unfairly, surrogates who want remarks carefully scripted by top policy gurus or surrogates who refuse to consider remarks crafted by top policy gurus. And then there are the random issues that always crop up, like trying to track down exactly who got food poisoning at that fundraiser when the shrimp seemed to have been a bit off.\n\nSo you don\u2019t have to be a total control freak to just want one simple event to go off smoothly. No surprises. Follow that breadcrumb trail very far and the next thing you know you are interviewing potential coffee shop talent and driving them to the event. It all makes sense at the moment. Like Iran-Contra. We\u2019ve got guns. They\u2019ve got hostages. Why not?\n\nIt\u2019s a self-defeating cycle: Campaigns try to control everything, reporters resent that control, and campaigns resent that resentment.\n\nBut why this obsession with presenting inauthentic authenticity? What does this quality we seem to value so much in today\u2019s political marketplace have to do with being a great president? It\u2019s difficult to imagine a more inauthentic president than John Kennedy, with his double and triple hidden lives. Was Franklin Roosevelt, who tried to mask the defining reality of his physical life, \u201cauthentic\u201d? Then again, try to imagine FDR handling the Hillary coffee shop set piece without wincing. Should that have been held against him as a potential president?\n\nThe truth is that every campaign struggles with how to campaign. In 2008, Barack Obama was a rare speaker who could draw rare crowds and the campaign wisely played to his strength. But by 2012, it was more difficult to repeat that magic and there were the awkward, inevitable crowd-size comparisons to 2008.\n\nIn the 2012 primary, Mitt Romney focused on the economy and we tried, when possible, to have events at settings that drove an economic message: small businesses, factories, job incubators. When we got away from that, we often stumbled, like a disastrous, half-empty event in a soulless convention hall in the South Carolina primary.\n\nThe scene of reporters chasing after Hillary Clinton\u2019s luxury van\u2014what CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby deftly labeled \u201cthe running of the reporters\u201d\u2014was a terrible omen for the months ahead. In a time of fewer reporters with fewer resources, my plea to the media would be to focus less on spending time with candidates and campaigns and more with voters. Don\u2019t worry about trying to get something new out of multimillion (or billion)-dollar enterprises dedicated to denying them that novelty.\n\nIt\u2019s a self-defeating cycle: Campaigns try to control everything, reporters resent that control, and campaigns resent that resentment. Out of it often comes the almost unavoidable magnification of the trivial\u2014what one random voter said or what a candidate ate or didn\u2019t eat or what dangling participle was mangled in a speech everyone has heard a million times.\n\nCandidates mostly try to be boring and predictable\u2014that\u2019s called message control\u2014and, more often than not, they are pretty good at achieving that goal. But the good news is that candidates won\u2019t decide this election\u2014voters will. In an ever DC-NYC centric media world, it\u2019s never been more critical to spend more time with voters. Journalists can watch the candidates and their staged events from phones or computers while spending serious face-to-face time with real voters. Yes, I know, many reporters do this now and that\u2019s a good thing. I\u2019m not suggesting anything radically new but praising those who do and gently encouraging the trend to do more.\n\nTo me, it\u2019s like war reporting. Being with a candidate is like reporting from the Pentagon or inside a big U.S. base. Worthwhile? Of course. But the great stories, the ones who help us understand what we don\u2019t, are out there, waiting to be told. And best of all, no campaign can try to tell you what to do.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:47.413+0000"}

Wait \u2019til people see how the Hillary-friendly operation spent what money it managed to bring in.\n\nBy Carrie Levine, Center for Public Integrity\n\nLiberals have slammed Priorities USA Action, the pro-Hillary Clinton super PAC, for not raising enough money, but that didn\u2019t prevent a pair of prominent Democratic operatives from scoring lucrative paydays with the group.\n\nPriorities USA Action made the handsome payments to Bill Burton and Sean Sweeney\u2014or companies connected to them\u2014during 2013 and 2014, when the formerly pro-Barack Obama super PAC effectively went dormant, neither raising money nor spending its reserves directly on midterm elections.\n\nWhat was Priorities USA Action doing? Spending nearly $2 million on expenses, including salaries, consulting fees, rent, legal fees, health care, and taxes, as it positioned itself to become the flagship super PAC supporting a Clinton presidential run.\n\nHundreds of thousands of dollars of that money were directed at Burton and Sweeney, former Obama White House aides who founded Priorities USA Action in 2011 to support Obama\u2019s re-election bid.\n\nThe expenditures are striking in light of the current situation at Priorities USA Action, which is shaking up its leadership ranks amid reports of infighting and disappointing fundraising.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported this week that the super PAC expects to collect only about $15 million through the end of June\u2014not an insignificant amount, but far less than the amounts reportedly raised by super PACs backing Clinton\u2019s likely Republican rivals, including those supporting Jeb Bush and Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.\n\nThe super PAC directly paid Burton $30,394 and Sweeney $24,781 during early 2013, according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission. But these payroll disbursements ended by March 2013, around the time Burton left the super PAC\u2019s staff.\n\nBeginning in early 2013, Priorities USA Action began paying what would amount to $220,000 over the two-year period to Independence Avenue LLC, a limited liability company incorporated in Washington, D.C.\n\nPaul Begala, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton who consults for Priorities USA Action, took in $240,000 from the super PAC during the two-year period, records show.\n\nIncorporation records list Sweeney and Burton as the corporation\u2019s only members, the Center for Public Integrity has found. Priorities USA Action\u2019s payments to Independence Avenue LLC almost all went for \u201cstrategy and media consulting,\u201d according to disclosures filed with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nPriorities USA Action is the only federal political action committee that has paid Independence Avenue LLC for services, according to an analysis of reports filed with the FEC since the beginning of the 2012 election cycle.\n\nIn addition, Priorities USA, a sister nonprofit of Priorities USA Action that folded last year, paid Independence Avenue $150,000 for \u201ccommunication and strategy\u201d in 2013, according to the group\u2019s final tax filing (PDF). An Internal Revenue Service filing indicates the $150,000 went to Sweeney personally.\n\nThe tax filing also shows Priorities USA, the nonprofit, paid $200,000 in 2013 to Global Strategy Group, where Burton worked as an executive vice president until he jumped to SKDKnickerbocker in January 2015.\n\nSweeney is also a partner at the Messina Group, the consulting firm started by Jim Messina, Obama\u2019s 2012 campaign manager and a former White House staffer. Messina is a co-chairman of Priorities USA Action.\n\nThe super PAC reported paying the Messina Group nearly $90,000 in rent during 2013 and 2014.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether Priorities USA Action\u2019s leadership overhaul will affect future paydays for Burton and Sweeney.\n\nPeter Kauffmann, a spokesman for Priorities USA Action, declined to comment. Burton and Sweeney did not respond to requests for comments.\n\nOther notable Democratic consultants likewise received payments from Priorities USA Action during 2013 and 2014, its period of near-dormancy.\n\nPaul Begala, a former adviser to President Bill Clinton who consults for Priorities USA Action, took in $240,000 from the super PAC during the two-year period, records show.\n\nThe super PAC reported paying about $127,000 during the 2014 election cycle to the Ashmead Group for fundraising consulting. Diana Rogalle, the president of the Ashmead Group, has also been a senior advisor to Priorities USA Action.\n\nOverall, hundreds of millions of dollars flow through federal super PACs, which can be lucrative for political consultants.\n\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s Priorities USA or [anti-Clinton] America Rising, there\u2019s just a lot more money in the age of super PACs and a lot more people willing to spend it,\u201d said Adam Smith, communications director for Every Voice, an advocacy group that wants to reduce the influence of money in politics.\n\nPriorities USA Action did give $1.4 million to other political groups during the 2014 election cycle, with the bulk of the money going to super PACs that unsuccessfully spent millions of dollars in an effort to elect Democratic majorities in the U.S. House and U.S. Senate.\n\nPriorities USA Action also urged its donors to give money to other liberal political groups during the 2014 election cycle, saying it didn\u2019t want to interfere with other fundraising efforts supporting Democratic control of Congress.\n\nThe Priorities USA Action leadership shakeup is largely bad news for Obama loyalists who\u2019ve previously worked with the super PAC.\n\nThe rejiggering most notably involves Guy Cecil, who at one point managed Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, taking over as the super PAC\u2019s chief executive officer and co-chairman of the board. Messina will remain with the group, but reportedly in a reduced role.\n\nBuffy Wicks, Priorities USA Action\u2019s executive director, is expected to take a role either with the Clinton campaign or the Democratic National Committee upon leaving.\n\nWicks is being replaced by Anne Caprara, the vice president of campaigns at EMILY\u2019s List, a political committee that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights.\n\nThis story is from The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

{"entityId": 1653, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There will be six Democratic debates announced this week\u2014and if candidates stray from the DNC\u2019s strict rules, they will be punished by the Party Elite.\n\nOnce the Republican presidential candidates leave the debate stage, the spotlight will shift to the Democrats. The Daily Beast has learned that the Democratic National Committee will announce its debate schedule later this week, with six debates beginning in the fall, and with penalties for candidates and media outlets that stray from the sanctioned schedule.\n\nDemocrats are way behind the pace they set in the 2008 cycle\u2014the last time there was an open Democratic nomination. By this point in the primary calendar, there had already been five debates, the first one in South Carolina in April \u201907. Anita Dunn, a Democratic strategist and debate expert, said in an e-mail that the process got off to a later start this year because Democrats didn\u2019t have a declared candidate until May, when Hillary Clinton announced. In 2007, meanwhile, the field was pretty well set by May, she recalled.\n\n\u201cIf we had tried to hold debates in April 2015 we would have had no candidates. The Republicans are starting in August, we will start in the fall, and I think both parties felt this was the right balance,\u201d Dunn wrote.\n\nDebate planning has been underway at the DNC since early last year, and Vice President Biden\u2019s staff has been kept in the loop all along as a party leader and someone who has openly talked about possibly running. Lobbying by the campaigns has been intense, with Clinton\u2019s campaign wanting fewer than six debates, while the staffs of Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders asking for more than that.\n\nThe sooner the debates begin, the sooner candidates like Sanders and O\u2019Malley are helped. They need the oxygen, the airtime, the access to donors -- all the benefits that flow from standing on the stage with the frontrunner. Contrary to conventional wisdom, Clinton will be helped as well, says Washington lawyer and Democratic activist Paul Equale.\n\nOne thing is sure, Clinton is going to follow the rules; she won\u2019t do more than the six debates.\n\n\u201cThe sooner the phony war becomes a real campaign, the better for Hillary,\u201d he says. \u201cShe has the worst of all worlds now with this pseudo campaign going on. Once she stands on the stage with people who are running against her, she can be spontaneous and authentic and present herself as a real candidate, as opposed to a heir apparent waiting to be coronated.\u201d\n\nFormer DNC chairman Howard Dean first introduced the idea of limiting debates to six when he chaired the DNC at the beginning of the \u201908 cycle. There had been 24 Democratic debates during the \u201904 cycle and candidates could do little else but go from debate prep to debate to debate prep, with little time for campaigning. With so many debates, there were diminishing returns for the candidates, the voters and for media outlets whose budgets were strained.\n\nDean\u2019s proposal fell apart almost immediately. Univision invited Democrats to debate, and no one was going to say no to that. Then the invitations kept coming, from labor, from environmentalists, and by the end of the \u201908 primaries, there had been 27 debates.\n\nSo this cycle, determined to put a lid on the process, Democrats took an idea from the Republicans, who had announced there would be penalties on their candidates if they went outside the Republican National Committee\u2019s sanctioned debates. If Sanders or O\u2019Malley tries to test the DNC, they would risk getting aced out of the other debates. Ditto for a media outlet that tried to mount something separate on the side, as they would risk losing Hillary Clinton as a contender.\n\nOne thing is sure, Clinton is going to follow the rules; she won\u2019t do more than the six debates. And the networks understand the DNC has control of the process because Hillary is on board with the plan and she\u2019s not going to show up for any debates that are not sanctioned.\n\nForums are allowed because they\u2019re more of a cattle call. All five Democratic candidates will be speaking at the DNC summer meeting in Minneapolis on August 28th, but they won\u2019t be sharing a stage.\n\nThe DNC will also announce this week uniform criteria for inclusion in the debates. Democrats aren\u2019t concerned about the number of candidates as they don\u2019t have that many. But they want to head off what happened in \u201907 and \u201908, when debate hosts changed the rules from debate to debate.\n\nThe result was former Alaska Senator Mike Gravel, the first in the field to announce for president, being allowed into several debates. He quickly achieved notoriety for his anti-war position and curmudgeonly demeanor. Then, after failing to exceed 1 percent in the polls, he was barred from debating.\n\nAnti-war candidate Dennis Kucinich suffered much the same fate. The criteria for when he was in or out of a particular debate was subject to change, and after MSNBC excluded him from a January \u201908 debate in Las Vegas, Kucinich sued the network. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled against him, and Kucinich was out of the race by late January, citing his exclusion from the debates as a factor in his decision.\n\nThis time the DNC isn\u2019t leaving anything to chance as the party lays out its debate agenda. In politics, however, the best-laid plans often go awry, and this level of control by the party establishment is almost certain to get pushback from some Democrats.

{"entityId": 1654, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The king of talk radio could take out Trump if he wanted to, so why won\u2019t he sack up and do it?\n\nThe New York Times recently ran a piece titled, Rush Limbaugh Rallies Listeners to Donald Trump\u2019s Defense. In reading Rush\u2019s full transcript, I found that headline a bit unfair. On Monday, he did cite ex-CBS reporter Sharyl Attkisson\u2019s defense of Trump\u2014which I (and others) found to be unpersuasive. But his comments were far more nuanced than the Times\u2019 headline suggested.\n\nApparently Limbaugh felt that way, too. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t join in the condemnation of Trump,\u201d he explained on Tuesday, \u201cI might as well be supporting him [in the media\u2019s mind]. \u201cI\u2019m not coming to the rescue of anybody,\u201d he added.\n\nFair enough, all that. So while it would be a stretch to ding Limbaugh for coming to Trump\u2019s rescue, I\u2019m equally interested in what Rush Limbaugh did not do. He did not take this opportunity to help the Republican Party and the conservative movement by excommunicating Donald Trump.\n\nAnd that, I would suggest, wasn\u2019t just a missed opportunity, but rather an abdication of responsibility.\n\nAs I\u2019ve written on numerous occasions, one of the major problems confronting the conservative movement today is that individual actors have perverse incentives to tarnish the collective brand.\n\nWe see this play out when politicians like Trump say controversial things for the sake of buzz and poll numbers, but also true of conservative \u201cpersonalities\u201d who, after all, also need buzz and ratings and page views. Everyone is looking out for themselves, not conservatism or conservatives in general. It\u2019s basically a \u201ctragedy of the commons\u201d-type situation, where there are no adults looking out for the common good.\n\nBut with great power comes great responsibility. And Limbaugh is one of the few leaders in the conservative movement who has the megaphone and the juice to enforce discipline and good behavior, the way Bill Buckley did when he chose to write Ayn Rand, the Birchers, and a whole host of other unpleasant factions, out of the conservative movement.\n\nEveryone is looking out for themselves, not conservatism or conservatives in general.\n\nTrump, who until quite recently was a pro-choice, Hillary Clinton-supporting believer in single-payer health insurance, is no conservative. And while many of the usual suspects\u2014Ann Coulter, Ted Cruz, Mark Levin, Laura Ingraham, et al.\u2014are providing Trump aid and comfort, one wonders whether they\u2019re using him to advance their own self interest. (Even Bill Kristol was playing this game until it finally became untenable.)\n\nFor Coulter and company, it\u2019s easy to see that their popularity is the result of reflecting the whims of the masses of grassroots conservatives, and that this audience is (for today, at least) somewhat enamored with Trump. These conservative personalities are not leaders, that is; they\u2019re followers, and they\u2019re cozying up to The Donald to leech off his popularity with some of the base, boost their ratings, and prove their \u201cauthenticity\u201d by associating with the candidate most loathed by \u201cthe establishment.\u201d\n\nThis is not to suggest that nobody on the right has the cajones to stand up to Trump. In fairness, The Wall Street Journal has pointed out Trump\u2019s horrible record and rhetoric, but their audience tends to be free market or fiscal conservatives\u2014not the more angry, populist-leaning sort who listen to talk radio, read Breitbart.com, and might be susceptible to someone like Trump. These are the people who Limbaugh, who is still the king of talk radio, could dissuade from backing a charlatan like The Donald, and his refusal to thus far is truly dispiriting.\n\nBut there is at least one conservative blogger and talk radio host who is presenting an intellectually honest critique of Donald Trump. Although Erick Erickson suggests the establishment is ultimately responsible for creating the environment where Trump would flourish, he pulls no punches in a recent blog post.\n\nErickson also notes (and this really can\u2019t be said enough) that Trump was \u201ca Hillary Clinton donor,\u201d a supporter of a \u201cCanadian style universal healthcare system,\u201d a past \u201csupporter of abortion rights,\u201d someone who told MSNBC he was \u201cevolving on gay marriage,\u201d and someone who thought Mitt Romney\u2019s rhetoric about illegal immigrants was too harsh.\n\nErickson is exactly right. And while he certainly qualifies as a prominent conservative opinion leader, it\u2019s a real shame that he\u2019s one of the few in his space willing to tell grassroots conservatives the truth about their phony new hero.\n\nWhy would any real conservative want to defend this guy?

But Clinton\u2019s deafening and widely criticized silence since announcing her candidacy isn\u2019t a weakness or a failing on her part. It underscores exactly the professionalism, strategizing, and discipline that explain why she is atop the polls.\n\nShe has nothing to gain and everything to lose from shooting off her mouth for at least the rest of the year. Like an aging boxer who survives more by smarts than by slugging, Clinton knows that the fight for the White House is a 15-round bout that will certainly go the distance. Only a showboating chump would punch themselves out in the early rounds.\n\nSure, over the past few weeks, she\u2019s lost some ground among Democratic voters to socialist Bernie Sanders. But she\u2019s still ahead of him, not to mention the ever-growing gaggle of Republican rivals. Sure, ever since announcing she was running for president, Clinton has stayed awfully quiet, popping up in Chipotle surveillance camera footage like Patty Hearst on the lam and eschewing actual public events for \u201cintimate\u201d meetings with vetted, handpicked supporters.\n\nOn the rare occasions when she does step out of her bubble, things have gotten hinky, like when she literally roped off the press during a Fourth of July parade in New Hampshire. The optics of that scene\u2014photogs and journos being physically restrained from getting close enough to her highness to take good pics or ask embarrassing queries\u2014would be shame-inducing if not suicide-inducing to most candidates.\n\nBut do we need to spell it out, really? Hillary Clinton is not most candidates.\n\nHillary is turning into a defensive master, but on her own terms.\n\nShe\u2019s learned from the acknowledged master\u2014husband Bill, who can\u2019t even be bothered to flatly promise not to give paid speeches if he becomes First Dude\u2014that there\u2019s never a reason to give in to common decency and slink off into the dark night of political oblivion. Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t driven a car since 1996 and it\u2019s a safe bet that she hasn\u2019t felt shame for even longer.\n\nSince announcing for president, Clinton has granted exactly one televsion interview, with CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar, and smartly used the occasion to attack the Republican field for their weak-tea responses to Donald Trump\u2019s muy stupido assertion that Mexican immigrants are mostly rapists. Indicating that she was \u201cdisappointed\u201d (read: elated) \u201cin those comments,\u201d Clinton went on to note that her Republican rivals \u201care all in the same general area on immigration.\u201d\n\nThe worst part of that? She\u2019s absolutely right. Once the party of near-open borders (watch this video from 1980 in which Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush one up each other on praising the contributions of illegal immigrants), today\u2019s GOP, with minor exceptions, vilifies the wretched yearning to breathe free, at least when they come from Latin America.\n\nIn 2004, George Bush won 44 percent of the Hispanic vote. Eight years later, Mitt Romney\u2014who counseled that illegal immigrants should practice \u201cself-deportation\u201d\u2014pulled just 27 percent. In the GOP \u201cautopsy\u201d of Romney\u2019s failure in 2012, the authors wrote, \u201cIf Hispanic Americans hear that the GOP doesn\u2019t want them in the United States, they won\u2019t pay attention to our next sentence.\u201d Given the way that the current candidates have been non-reacting to Trump, that might be the best outcome the Republican Party could hope for.\n\nAgainst such a backdrop, Clinton is right to keep mum, except when making easy layups against her opponents. Let Bernie Sanders whip Democrats into a progressive frenzy and then step in with vague nods toward equality and growth for all. She knows full well that Sanders is not her real rival\u2014that will be the GOP nominee, not a frothing-at-the-mouth socialist from a state with a population smaller than Washington, D.C.\u2019s.\n\nShe also knows as well as anyone that her toughest challenge will be sweetening the air of inevitability that surrounds her like noxious secondhand smoke. No one outside of their immediate families wants to see a Clinton-Bush contest, but such a showdown is more likely than not. She may indeed be as \u201carrogant\u201d as Commentary and a thousand other similar publications contend, but she\u2019s likely smart enough to realize that nothing humanizes her more than right-wing outlets foaming at the mouth about everything from blowjobs to Benghazi.\n\nThis is not to say that she\u2019s a perfect candidate. In fact, the roping off of journalists\u2014on a day celebrating independence, no less!\u2014suggests Hillary Clinton is in many ways singularly off-putting. Her feminist bona fides were rightly called into question during her time as First Lady, her time as senator from New York was unmemorable, and her tenure as secretary of state nothing short of disastrous. When under attack, she\u2019s capable of mind-bogglingly stupid comments, like when she started talking about Bobby Kennedy\u2019s assassination during the end days of her 2008 run for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThis is why she is smart to be running a rope-a-dope strategy, essentially letting her opponents (Democratic and Republican) punch themselves out in the early rounds. When they\u2019ve taken their best shots and mostly exhausted themselves, she can come off the ropes and throw a haymaker or two. Along with forgoing shame, this is another great tactical advantage she\u2019s learned from her husband.\n\nBill Clinton outlasted his opponents\u2014think Newt Gingrich and a gaggle of moralistic congressmen, many of whom had skeletons of their own to hide. Bill was like Muhammad Ali taking on George Foreman in the jungle heat, a personable motormouth who loved to talk and press the flesh (sometimes a bit too much, to be sure). Hillary is turning into a defensive master, but on her own terms. She\u2019s more like Floyd Mayweather, nobody\u2019s idea of a fun person to hang out with, but capable of taking huge amounts of punishment and coming off the ropes in the late rounds to secure victory.\n\nIf the eventual Republican nominee\u2014whether it\u2019s Jeb Bush or Rand Paul or god help us all Donald Trump\u2014wants a real chance at the crown, they\u2019d do best to back away from Hillary and the anger-bear rhetoric that only makes her more sympathetic. The nominee would do well to outline an actually positive and inclusive message about how they plan to guide the country into the 21st century rather than constantly harp on last century\u2019s scandals, the need for even newer and bigger wars, and protecting us from the scourge of immigrants so desperate for a better life that they\u2019re willing to risk arrest to come to America.\n\nA Republican employing positive rhetoric\u2014which is exactly how Barack Obama toppled Clinton in 2008\u2014would pull her out of her crouch and cause her to swing recklessly and wildly. In all that lunging, she\u2019d be likely to knock herself out.

But 2016 is going to change that.\n\nIf you\u2019re not flaxen-haired yourself, you may not have noticed (or you might not care) but, right now, both parties\u2019 front-runners have unmistakably blond hair. Not fair, not fading, but full-on blond like champagne or a field of wheat. For any student of presidential hairdos, this is the equivalent of a Halley\u2019s Comet sighting\u2014it\u2019s incredible and you may not see it again for decades.\n\nMuch has been made of Donald Trump\u2019s comb-over\u2014more of a comb-forward, really\u2014but its color is just as remarkable. In his new Time cover story, it practically glistens, like a nest of golden tinsel delicately arranged atop his head. The bald eagle in the Time photo shoot is as white-headed as the vast majority of former presidents but The Donald is unapologetically blond.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s own blond tresses have received plenty of undue attention in sexist faux controversies over the past two decades. She is an out-and-proud bottle blonde, telling South Carolina voters this May, \u201cI\u2019ve been coloring my hair for years.\u201d French stylist Isabelle Goetz, who has been cutting the former Secretary of State\u2019s hair since 1999, still claims her as a client.\n\nTrump and Clinton: two parties, two genders, two famous heads of hair, one hair color. There must be something in the water\u2014or in the salon mixing bowl\u2014because Carly Fiorina\u2019s bob has been looking a little lighter lately as well. The 2016 election is officially the blondest one in electoral history.\n\nNearly 70 percent of women said that if they had to hire someone based on hair color alone, they\u2019d choose a brunette.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be worthy of comment if it wasn\u2019t so rare. In an ideal world, a politician\u2019s hair color shouldn\u2019t matter but, in contemporary image-obsessed American politics, it almost certainly does. Politics is perception and perception is hair\u2014at least in part. And so far, light-haired political aspirants haven\u2019t had much luck reaching the highest office.\n\nWhat\u2019s been holding them back?\n\nFor one, there\u2019s some evidence to suggest that blond hair could be a liability for women running for the Oval. Hair color company Clairol has surveyed women several times over the years asking them to predict the hair color of the first female president. In 2002, 76 percent of women and 74 percent of men predicted that she would be brunette. By 2008, when we had a better idea of who \u201cshe\u201d might be, the results were more split but respondents still perceived brunettes as being more serious and trustworthy. Nearly 70 percent of women said that if they had to hire someone based on hair color alone, they\u2019d choose a brunette.\n\nBy now, too, several scientific studies have shown that negative stereotypes about blond women may have more of an impact on our perception than we\u2019d like to admit. One famous 1996 study found that 136 college students reviewing identical r\u00e9sum\u00e9s with different photos attached were more likely to rate blond women and redheads as less capable. To add insult to injury, they also assigned blondes lower starting salaries.\n\n\u201cThus, regardless of their actual performance, blondes and/or redheads may have a difficult time overcoming any initial skepticism about their capabilities,\u201d the authors concluded.\n\nHowever, there are currently several blond female senators\u2014like Elizabeth Warren and Claire McCaskill\u2014so perhaps the blond ceiling will prove to be less difficult to crack than the glass one.\n\nBlond male candidates, on the other hand, may face even more challenging obstacles, the most inevitable being age.\n\nCarly Fiorina\u2019s bob has been looking a little lighter lately as well. The 2016 election is officially the blondest one in electoral history.\n\nIn over 200 years, we\u2019ve had a mere handful of blond heads of state and almost all of them have gone gray by the time they took office. Jefferson is commonly said to have \u201creddish blonde\u201d hair as a young man but any golden hues had vanished by the time his stoic portrait was painted.\n\nAs Hillary Clinton playfully put it, American presidents tend to \u201cgrow grayer and grayer and by the time they leave, they are as white as the building they live in.\u201d\n\nWhich ones were blond before their first term? Depends who you ask. Remembering the hair color of men that we know best as white-haired statesmen takes a bit of research. It\u2019s also complicated by the inherent subjectiveness of blond hair\u2014there\u2019s no denying that a young Trump had blond hair, for example, but a young Jimmy Carter is up for debate.\n\nFortunately, an Oregon artist by the name bijijoo painstakingly documented the shifting hair colors of every U.S. president when he painted oil portraits of each one holding a ham.\n\nBenjamin Harrison, the artist notes, was \u201ccorn-silk blonde in his youth\u201d and white in his old age. Jackson, Coolidge, and Carter were \u201csandy,\u201d but did not quite cross the blond threshold. James Garfield he describes as having had \u201clight brown\u201d hair, although others have labeled him blond. Gerald Ford likely had the blondest hair of all U.S. presidents but, as his biographer would later observe, it was \u201cshading to gray\u201d well before he took office.\n\nGiven the prevalence of blondeness in the European countries from which our presidents\u2019 ancestors tend to hail, there probably should have been a few more in the bunch.\n\nBut blond men face stereotypes unique to their gender. We can already see some of them at work in popular depictions of Trump.\n\nIn film and television, the trope of the bad blond man is particularly well-worn. In romantic comedies, blond men often play the role of \u201cother guy\u201d who briefly distracts the heroine from her darker-haired destiny. In action movies, they\u2019re usually villains. According to one tally, there have been eight blond Bond villains\u2014most recently Javier Bardem\u2019s effete, bleached-blond, sport coat-wearing turncoat in Skyfall.\n\nOf course, by bragging about his wealth and flying into the Iowa State Fair in his $7 million helicopter, Trump isn\u2019t exactly distancing himself from the trappings of Bond villain either. One columnist has already called him \u201cthe swaggering blonde supervillain of the GOP\u201d and the comparison has not been lost on comedians.\n\nBuzzfeed, being Buzzfeed, has already published a \u201cWho Said It: Donald Trump or a James Bond Villain\u201d quiz but Trump\u2019s side-by-side resemblance to Max Zorin from A View to Kill is more interesting than any similarities in conversational style.\n\nNow imagine Trump with a classic Reagan cut. The Bond villain comparison might still be made but it wouldn\u2019t be nearly as tempting. It\u2019d be hard to picture any headlines dubbing him the \u201cbrown-haired supervillain of the GOP,\u201d for instance.\n\nAnd there\u2019s more than just media-based evidence to support the idea that the American public might prefer a brown-haired man in office.\n\nA 2012 study from social psychologist Nicolas Gu\u00e9guen found that women were less likely to respond to dance requests from men with blond hair than men with brown or black hair. An earlier U.S. study found that less than 20 percent of a small sample of straight white undergraduate women preferred blond men. Everything from dating websites to romance novels can attest that blond men, for some reason, are not as desirable to the masses.\n\nWrote one romance novel reviewer decrying the lack of blond love interests, \u201c[I]f you are one of the romance readers who lives in the U.S., you might think a blond guy is weak, effeminate, safe, vain, a morally perfect angel, or just too \u2018model good looking\u2019 to be interesting.\u201d\n\nRunning for president is not the same as dating, true, but both involve a degree of courtship. And in a country where the so-called \u201cbeer test\u201d seriously impacts a candidate\u2019s chance of success, it\u2019s not crazy to think that a brown-haired man might have a head start.\n\nAfter all, we need only look as far as Dan Quayle to see what can happen when politicians bet on blond. When the elder Bush first announced his VP pick back in 1988, the Los Angeles Times recorded the following humdinger of a prediction: \u201cBush strategists said that the blonde Quayle, sometimes described as a Robert Redford look-alike, would bring glamour to the ticket.\u201d\n\nYears later, political columnists remember Quayle as \u201ca dumb blonde male.\u201d That\u2019s probably how Trump will be described in the future, too.\n\nBut the present is still a time bursting with potentialities. Clinton may get toppled and Trump will almost certainly lose if he makes it to the general election but, for now, we can simply bask in the golden rays of light emanating from the front-runners\u2019 coiffures and dream, for the first time, of a breathtakingly blond president.\n\nBlondes may have more fun but they have fewer nuclear codes.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:50.023+0000"}
{"entityId": 1657, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "After the ACA and marriage rulings, liberals might be feeling, hey, the court\u2019s not so bad. But it is. And rulings can always be reversed.\n\nIt would be understandable if liberals were feeling kind of relaxed, kind of \u201cSupreme Court, what\u2019s so bad?\u201d over the weekend. John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy delivered for our team on Obamacare, and then Kennedy came through again on same-sex marriage. If this is a conservative court, is getting a liberal one\u2014which will be one of the trump-card arguments for voting for Hillary Clinton next fall\u2014really a matter of such pressing urgency?\n\nWell, yes. As we saw yesterday with the court\u2019s death-penalty and EPA rulings, it\u2019s still a long way from being a liberal court. But there\u2019s more to it than that. People should remember that if a Republican is elected president next year and has the chance to replace Kennedy and/or Ruth Bader Ginsburg with another Samuel Alito, the Obamacare and same-sex marriage standings could easily be reversed. And don\u2019t think there aren\u2019t conservatives out there thinking about it, because there most certainly are, and they literally want to roll back the judicial clock to 1905.\n\nAn interesting and important debate opened up over the weekend in conservative legal circles that you should take time to educate yourself about. Many conservatives, of course, are furious with Roberts and Kennedy and are wondering, with conservatives like this, who needs liberals?\n\nThe ins and outs of the debate were deftly summarized yesterday by Ian Millhiser of Think Progress. I\u2019m not going to take you as deep into the jurisprudential weeds as Millhiser does, but here\u2019s the basic story. Since the 1980s, \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d has been the guiding principle of conservative jurisprudence\u2014the idea that judges shouldn\u2019t make law from the bench but should rule more narrowly and modestly, deferring to the other branches. Roberts was invoking judicial restraint during his confirmation hearings with that famous line about judges just calling \u201cballs and strikes.\u201d\n\nJudicial restraint was appealing to conservatives at the time because to a large extent, majorities of the public shared their views on pressing issues of the day. It was liberals back then who were trying to gain through the courts what they could not accomplish through legislatures and the political process.\n\nBut now that reality is to a considerable extent reversed. Public opinion is firmly against conservatives on same-sex marriage, and even on Obamacare, though the law (or the name of the law) remains unpopular, polling before last week\u2019s decision showed that majorities didn\u2019t want the Court to take away people\u2019s health-care subsidies. And besides, Obamacare is after all a law, duly passed by the people\u2019s representatives in Washington.\n\nJudicial restraint, apparently, breeds certain counter-revolutionary tendencies.\n\nSo now it\u2019s the right trying to achieve through the courts outcomes that it could not through the political process. This is what Roberts in essence said in his majority opinion upholding the health-care law. \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cIf at all possible, we must interpret the Act in a way that is consistent with the former, and avoids the latter.\u201d\n\nAll of this takes us back to Lochner v. New York, a 1905 decision that I\u2019m not going to get into here (Millhiser does) but that in essence used the Fourteenth Amendment to extend rights not to individuals but to employers. The decision led to a series of decisions up through the New Deal that invalidated several key pieces of progressive legislation protecting workers and more. The Lochner majority relied on a view of the Fourteenth Amendment that is now discredited\u2014except on the far right.\n\nWhich brings us to this past weekend. Conservative Georgetown law professor Randy Barnett wrote a column lambasting judicial restraint, arguing that \u201cselecting judges with the judicial mindset of \u2018judicial restraint\u2019 and \u2018deference\u2019 to the majoritarian branches leads to the results we witnessed in NFIB [the first upholding of Obamacare back in 2012] and King.\u201d He wants judges who embrace Lochner and who understand the \u201cduty of judges to invalidate unconstitutional law without restraint or deference.\u201d\n\nBarnett specifically cited Clarence Thomas as an example of a judge who has this depth of understanding. And conservative law professor Jonathan Adler, one of the two, ah, creative minds who brought us the bogus King v. Burwell lawsuit in the first place, tweeted over the weekend that if a Republican wins the election next year, he ought to put Utah Senator Mike Lee on the court. As Millhiser notes, Lee is huge Lochner-ian, to the point that he thinks that Social Security, Medicare, and child labor laws are all unconstitutional.\n\nBarnett wrote in his column that there would heretofore be a new standard that conservative legal scholars will demand of Republican presidential nominees. Now, dimwit candidates like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio who yammer on about \u201cjudicial restraint\u201d and \u201cdeference to the other branches\u201d will be exposed as the traitors in waiting that they are, capable of upholding abominable notions like letting people who love each other get married or giving working-class and poor people a little financial help so they can take their kids to the doctor. Judicial restraint, apparently, breeds certain counter-revolutionary tendencies.\n\nAnd this, finally, circles us back to the 2016 election and health care and marriage equality. Several legal challenges to Obamacare are still pending. Other inventive approaches no doubt await us. For example, a group of legislators in some red state could sue claiming that as the elected representatives of the people, they were denied by the court their proper deliberative role in the process of deciding how to bring health care to their state. If we get a Republican president and he puts a Barnett/Adler-approved justice on the court, poof, sayonara subsidies.\n\nSame-sex marriage\u2019s majority is even more precarious. For example: A gay plaintiff or plaintiffs could bring some kind of discrimination lawsuit (despite the marriage win, there still are other kinds of discrimination lawsuits on the books). A Lochner-loving majority of five could use that suit as the occasion to say, actually, discrimination here is legal, and while we\u2019re at it, this marriage business\u2026\n\nAnd mind you, from a legal point of view, this would be legitimate. After all, think of it this way: If Kennedy had retired shortly after Citizens United and Barack Obama had put a liberal on the bench, liberals would have advanced at least one legal vehicle to try to get campaign-spending issues before the Court again hoping for reversal. All\u2019s fair in campaign-finance, health care, love, and bigotry.\n\nImagine how that would feel\u2014same-sex marriage overturned. Right now it\u2019s hypothetical, but it is a long, long way from impossible. And if the Republican wins in 2016, and if Barnett\u2019s arguments carry the day, we could end up with two or three more Alitos on the bench.\n\nStill feeling relaxed?\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:50.998+0000"}

Our thoughts and prayers are with these brave officers who, like thousands of their brethren across the United States, form a thin blue line that protects citizens in communities large and small regardless of their wealth, skin color, or religious beliefs.\n\nYet, something perverse has permeated our culture in America today, a culture where taking personal responsibility for one\u2019s actions has been replaced by a grievance industry that promotes white privilege as the root cause for all that ails them. Sadly, America\u2019s first African-American President and Attorney General have encouraged this myth\u2014with the media promoting an agenda rather than dispassionately reporting facts.\n\nThe fact is, most Americans never should have even heard about a shooting involving Michael Brown and police officer Darren Wilson. Every day in communities large and small, criminals commit crimes that elicit interaction from the police. In the instant case, it is a fact that Michael Brown committed a crime in a small town on August 9, 2014, failed to heed Officer Wilson\u2019s instructions, and was shot to death when the officer thought his life was in danger. The shooting never should have happened\u2014a young man never should have committed a crime and never should have rushed at a police officer.\n\nSadly, this incident provided the perfect opportunity for those who think that America is inherently racist and permanently ensconced in a 1965 Selma, Alabama, mindset with an opportunity: an opportunity to declare that a racist cop had gunned down an innocent black youth as the teen shouted \u201cHands up, Don\u2019t Shoot\u201d\u2014a fictional account that never happened.\n\nOn matters of race involving local police investigations, President Obama has not been shy about injecting himself into the narrative while shaping the desired outcomes. In 2009 when Harvard Professor Henry Louis \u201cSkip\u201d Gates had a disagreement with a Cambridge police officer outside of his home leading to his arrest, the president opined that the officer \u201cacted stupidly.\u201d Never mind that Mr. Gates didn\u2019t have his keys and was thought to be breaking into a home by the police officer in question. What I found revealing at the time is that the president offered the Gates incident as showing how \u201crace remains a factor in this society today\u201d when the facts revealed race had nothing to do with the interaction between a professor and a police officer.\n\nThe fact is, most Americans never should have even heard about a shooting involving Michael Brown and police officer Darren Wilson.\n\nTurning to the ginned-up cauldron of race that is now Ferguson, the president was once again quick to offer his opinion on local matter on which he knew nothing of the facts at hand. Days following the shooting the president assured the press that he had sent both the FBI and the Department of Justice to investigate the shooting of Michael Brown. Of particular relevance, Mr. Obama offered:\n\n\u201cOf course, it\u2019s important to remember how this started. We lost a young man, Michael Brown, in heartbreaking and tragic circumstances. He was 18 years old. His family will never hold Michael in their arms again. And when something like this happens, the local authorities\u2014including the police\u2014have a responsibility to be open and transparent about how they are investigating that death, and how they are protecting the people in their communities.\u201d\n\nThe circumstances under which Brown lost his life are both heartbreaking and tragic\u2014but not in the manner implied by the president. Rather than waiting for local authorities to complete their investigation, the president took sides\u2014particularly with the \u201chis family will never hold Michael in their arms again\u201d line. The implication here is that a white police gunned down a young black man in a manner that was irresponsible and opaque.\n\nThe narrative thus set, Al Sharpton and the media descended upon Ferguson alongside outside agitators who marched with such slogans as \u201cNo Justice, No Peace\u201d or \u201cHands Up, Don\u2019t Shoot.\u201d More unrest would follow when the grand jury elected not to indict the officer for the tragic shooting. Riots and looting would ensue\u2014with breathless coverage in the media and little from the President of the United States and the Attorney General to quell the violence.\n\nThe promised civil rights investigation by the Department of Justice was delivered on March 4, 2015. While the DOJ cited specific incidents of racism in the Ferguson police department leading to the resignation of the Mayor and the Chief of Police, the federal government substantiated the fact that Wilson\u2019s shooting of Brown wasn\u2019t motivated by race. The same Department of Justice that went into Ferguson to determine whether Michael Brown\u2019s civil rights were violated left having concluded that Wilson\u2019s shooting was deemed justified in light of the facts. I must give Holder\u2019s Justice Department credit for this impartial finding. But I\u2019m saddened that it was a finding that neither the president nor the media were interested in learning in the first place. The \u201cAmerica is racist\u201d narrative was broadcast endlessly, and our president did nothing to stop it.\n\nSo today in Ferguson, our thoughts and prayers are with two shot police officers who are tasked to protect and serve their community. If only they were protected and served by an irresponsible president who sees racism around every corner and reported by a corrupt media all to happy to help write the storyline.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:51.437+0000"}
{"entityId": 1659, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why we should all give thanks to ACT UP! founder and civil rights icon Larry Kramer.\n\nIt\u2019s been a pretty big week for legendary HIV/AIDS activist Larry Kramer, who celebrated his birthday on June 25, just one day before the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in favor of marriage equality. For a man who has lived with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) for many years, it may have come as a bit of a surprise to him to have lived to the ripe old age of 80. Countless numbers of Kramer\u2019s friends were not so lucky, and like so many gay men in the \u201980s and \u201990s, he nursed to their deaths (and all-too-quickly buried) many of his friends.\n\nLarry Kramer\u2019s story is movingly\u2014and unflinchingly\u2014told in a new HBO documentary about his life and remarkable achievements against overwhelming odds\u2014not just for gay men, but for all of us. Larry Kramer, In Love & Anger premieres tonight. Brilliantly directed by Jean Carlomusto, it chronicles the life of this complex, passionate and fearless activist.\n\nLarry Kramer reminds me of an Old Testament prophet: irascible, tough, morally righteous, certain of the truth he is telling, and willing to do almost anything to get his message heard. We see Kramer in the first decade of the HIV/AIDS pandemic when gay men were contracting and then rapidly dying from diseases known only to those with devastatingly compromised immune systems.\n\nLarry founds the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis both to signal to the world that this is a crisis and to begin to provide support to those whose deaths are attracting little attention or sympathy. Kramer rails against a President of the United States who will not publicly say the word \u201cAIDS,\u201d despite the fact that over 40,000 Americans have died from it. He screams\u2014yes, screams\u2014at audiences to call this what it is: a plague. And Kramer knows why this health crisis isn\u2019t getting any attention or funding: because those most affected are people the society deems disposable.\n\nKramer is out-of-control, in-your-face, crazy-mad about it, and says so at every possible opportunity.\n\nImpatient with the Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis\u2019s lack of progress\u2014both societally and medically\u2014Larry begins to fight with the leadership of the organization he founded. Not being one to mince words or to hold back harsh words for anyone not fighting as hard as he is, Larry leaves GMHC and founds Act Up!\u2014what might be called the commando unit in the fight to stop AIDS. Act Up!\u2019s language and tactics horrify many\u2014including many gay men!\u2014but Larry is on a mission. Act Up! unrelentingly pounds the American public health system for not doing more, and doing it faster.\n\nWe gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people are often woefully ignorant of our own history.\n\nDuring this time, Kramer is working on a way to chronicle the history of this plague and the public\u2019s indifference to the deaths of so many. Being an artist, writer, and poet, Kramer writes a brilliant, searing, and heartbreaking play, The Normal Heart. But there is nothing \u201cnormal\u201d about the raw emotion packed into this semi-autobiographical drama. Kramer spares no one\u2014not even himself\u2014from his biting critique of what went wrong in America when HIV invaded us.\n\nIn interviews recorded as recently as a year or two ago, this documentary allows us to see and hear Larry\u2019s reflections on that terrible time, before we knew what caused AIDS and how it was transmitted, when there was so much fear and so much hate. Early in the film, we see Larry rather mercilessly attacking Dr. Anthony Fauci (of the federal Centers for Disease Control) for the lack of progress in AIDS research, and then later hear Dr. Fauci crediting Kramer\u2019s raging advocacy for turning the tide against HIV.\n\nWe see Kramer chastising the gay community, which seemed to him to be valuing uninhibited sex over their health and lives. Finally, we see recent interviews of Larry while he was in the hospital during a medical emergency caused by his long-term infection with HIV (and the often debilitating drugs used to fight it).\n\nThinking back on his fight with Gay Men\u2019s Health Crisis, Larry rather wistfully says, \u201cWe destroyed each other. We destroyed the greatest thing we had created.\u201d The valiant and courageous warrior now looks frail and vulnerable (as we all will be someday), and his judgments seem a bit gentler\u2014on himself and on us all. But the prophet\u2019s fire is still there, just under the surface. He\u2019s still wilder and more passionate than anyone else, but nevertheless a bit softer.\n\nIt is said that a prophet is not honored in his own land. Even though he\u2019s become more famous in recent years, many gay men, and others who live with HIV, probably don\u2019t know who Larry Kramer is, or that he saved their lives. They have no idea that he\u2019s the one who pushed the government to develop the \u201ccocktail\u201d of drugs that now makes their viral loads undetectable and their lives livable. And that\u2019s a shame, because this is a prophet who should be honored by his own tribe and by the people of this land.\n\nWe gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people are often woefully ignorant of our own history. Many of our real heroes are unknown and \u201clost\u201d to our younger generation. Thanks to HBO and Larry Kramer: In Love and Anger, the profound legacy of this hero will endure.\n\nThank you, Larry, for giving us your passion, your life, your far-from-normal heart.

But now that her husband is a serious contender for the GOP nomination, your wait for the former supermodel to hit the 2016 campaign trail in all its deep-fried glory may soon be over.\n\nDonald Trump said as much a few weeks ago when he told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that Melania, whom Trump called \u201cmy pollster,\u201d will soon begin campaigning for his presidential bid.\n\nThus far, the 45-year-old third wife of Trump has been advising her husband behind the scenes (scolding Trump for making fun of Jeb Bush, for example, advice he clearly hasn\u2019t taken to heart). But she has been nearly invisible to the public. While other Republicans are dispatching their wives to recruit volunteers, greet voters and headline events, Mrs. Trump has appeared just twice alongside her husband, once at his campaign kickoff and again at the GOP debate in Cleveland.\n\nThe Trump campaign has declined to make Melania available for interviews, including for The Daily Beast. When a local Republican Club in Iowa called to ask for Melania to speak, \u201cthe Trump campaign said, \u2018How about Ivanka instead?\u2019\u201d referring to Trump\u2019s eldest daughter, who has made appearances on his behalf.\n\n\u201cI have a birth certificate from Slovenia. And do you want to see President Obama birth certificate or not?\u201d\n\nIn the CNN interview, Trump explained that he had held back on asking his wife to campaign for him, but that was about to change. \u201cShe will. She would certainly like to,\u201d Trump said, adding that she\u2019ll be \u201cunbelievable\u201d speaking on women\u2019s health issues.\n\nSo now that Melania is apparently ready for America, is America ready for her? Will conservatives warm up to a European supermodel who lives on three floors of Manhattan\u2019s Trump Tower, travels by private 757, and once posed alongside a blowup whale for the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition?\n\nA little bit Jackie Kennedy, a little Carla Bruni, Melania Trump is the first potential First Lady of her kind. In addition to her past success as a high fashion model, the former architecture student now has successful QVC jewelry and skin-care lines and is mother to 9-year-old Barron Trump.\n\nBorn in the former Yugoslavia, Melania would also be just the second American First Lady born outside of the United States (John Quincy Adams\u2019s wife, Louisa, was British), which raises the question of whether her status as a naturalized citizen will be a sticking point for Trump\u2019s anti-immigration supporters.\n\nTrump said that his wife shares his position on illegal immigration. \u201cShe agrees with me because she went through a long process to become a citizen. It was very tough,\u201d Trump told CNN. \u201cWhen she got it, she was very proud of it. She thinks it\u2019s a beautiful process to go through when it works.\u201d\n\nIn one of the few instances she has discussed politics publicly, Mrs. Trump also defended her husband\u2019s demands to see President Obama\u2019s birth certificate in the run up to the 2012 elections. \u201cI have a birth certificate from Slovenia. And do you want to see President Obama birth certificate or not?\u201d she asked Joy Behar in a 2011 interview.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only Donald who wants to see it. It\u2019s American people who voted for [the president] and who didn\u2019t vote for him. They want to see that.\u201d\n\nAt a recent Trump event in South Carolina, where Trump\u2019s tough talk on illegal immigration and international trade drew roars of approval from the audience, his fans knew little about Mrs. Trump, but said they had no problem with her foreign roots.\n\nRalph Kaiser from Hartwell, Georgia, described himself as \u201cTrump all the way\u201d and said he agrees completely with Trump\u2019s immigration plan.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a really drastic problem with illegal immigration,\u201d Kaiser said. \u201cThey\u2019ve broken into our country and we\u2019re accepting it and that\u2019s not right.

{"entityId": 1661, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, it\u2019s great to shift the paradigm from war-making to deal-making. But there are questions that shouldn\u2019t be left to neocon demagogues.\n\nSo, Senator Chris Coons, what do you think of the Iran deal?\n\nThere\u2019s a pause. I have spoken a few times in recent weeks to the Delaware Democratic senator, because a) he is deeply immersed in the details of this negotiation and b) he\u2019s coming from what seems to me roughly the right place here: He wants to support his president and he wants to see diplomacy succeed, but he doesn\u2019t trust Iran and he wants a deal that has a chance of actually working. He\u2019s thoughtful and smart and not a demagogue, and his ultimate support (or not) of the thing really will hang on the details and what he concludes about them.\n\nSo he opens by telling me that he first wants to give credit to President Obama and John Kerry for getting this done, because any negotiation is hard, this one almost incomprehensibly so. Then he gives an answer: \u201cIt seems on the face of it from press accounts to meet most of the goals that were set.\u201d He hadn\u2019t read it yet, but he\u2019d read enough about it to draw a few conclusions.\n\nStill, Coons says he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet how he\u2019ll vote. \u201cI\u2019m aware that it\u2019s easier to be critical than supportive because this deal is so complex and the stakes are so high,\u201d he told me. \u201cI do think the diplomacy was worth exploring.\u201d He wouldn\u2019t say this, of course, but it seems to me unlikely that Congress can kill the deal; Obama needs the backing of only 34 senators, which would result in a failure to override his certain veto of a \u201cno\u201d vote. It\u2019s hard to imagine he can\u2019t get that.\n\nCoons says he hasn\u2019t made up his mind yet how he\u2019ll vote.\n\nWe\u2019ll circle back to Coons, but first let\u2019s acknowledge a point that liberal Obama-backers everywhere ought to acknowledge in this case: The deal is a big gamble. Nobody can know today that it will work in the main goal of keeping the Islamic Republic from getting a nuclear weapon. Of course, nobody knows for certain that it will fail either, and Lindsey Graham and Tom Cotton and John Boehner\u2019s instant and predictable Munich-ification of a deal they obviously hadn\u2019t even read was revolting.\n\nBut the way to counter their false, know-nothing certitude is not with more false, know-nothing certitude. From a liberal internationalist point of view, it\u2019s clearly a good thing that Obama is trying to shift the reigning Washington foreign-policy paradigm from war-making to deal-making. The war-makers have been wrong about everything for the last 15 years, have told us endless lies, have harmed American credibility, have sown destruction and death\u2014and, by the way, have done a hell of a lot more to strengthen Iran than we doves have. So deal-making is a fine principle for which to strive. But that doesn\u2019t mean the deal is without risks and downsides, and liberals do themselves and the world no favors by not acknowledging them just because Tom Cotton is such a dreary soapbox haranguer.\n\nHere were Coons\u2019s four concerns in the order he listed them to me. First, the inspections regime; second, the timing of the sanctions relief; third, the degree to which the International Atomic Energy Agency will be able to keep track of the possible military dimensions of Iran\u2019s nuclear activities; and fourth, restrictions on centrifuge development after about year 10. \u201cI need to have a much better sense of the breakout time after 10 years,\u201d Coons said, noting concerns that limits on centrifuge development might ease after the tenth year.\n\nFor my money, Coons\u2019s second concern is the biggest potential problem here. Iran will get a $150 billion windfall starting in December, and while the regime will presumably spend some of that money at home, it\u2019s a certainty that the Syrian regime and Hezbollah and Hamas and the Houthis in Yemen are all going to get their share.\n\nCombine this money with the deal\u2019s lifting of the conventional arms embargo, which hasn\u2019t gotten much attention yet but you can be sure will get more, especially once Congress starts holding hearings on this, and you have a recipe for Iran to make far more trouble in the region than it has been in recent years. It should not comfort Americans, and American liberals in particular, that the likes of Bashar al-Assad and Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, both busy murdering Syrian children and suppressing any chance of real democracy being able to grow in Syria and Lebanon, praised the deal to the heavens.\n\nCoons told me he had a lengthy phone call with Joe Biden on Tuesday, and \u201cthat\u2019s precisely what I was discussing with the vice president.\u201d He said he\u2019d let Biden speak for himself, but he did tell me that he pressed Biden on questions like what we\u2019d be doing to beef up our commitments to our allies and to check Iranian influence. He says Biden assured him that stern measures were in the works. We\u2019ll see about that. This, too, will be much discussed in the upcoming hearings, and it\u2019s not only Republicans who have these concerns.\n\nObama says people should judge the deal only on whether it prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, that it isn\u2019t designed to change the nature of the regime or address regional terrorism. What this means is the administration made the decision that keeping a nuke out of Iran\u2019s hands was the job that took precedence over all other tasks. All in all that\u2019s probably the right call. Lindsey Graham said Tuesday that this deal would start an arms race. Not if it holds. If anything, it\u2019s the opposite that\u2019s true: Without a deal, Iran would surely develop a bomb more quickly, leading Saudi Arabia and perhaps others to do the same.\n\nBut surely Obama doesn\u2019t mean to suggest that we shouldn\u2019t discuss the other possible consequences of the deal. American liberals in particular should discuss these things. Nuclear nonproliferation is an old-school liberal value, but so is seeing our country take stands against the fundamentalist extremism that Iran exports and the kind of slaughter of civilians we see in Syria.\n\nI was pleased to see that Hillary Clinton\u2019s statement on the deal took both of these concerns seriously. Oddly, it\u2019s not on her website. I got it via email, and the part that impressed me says this: \u201cGoing forward, we have to be clear-eyed when it comes to the broader threat Iran represents. Even with a nuclear agreement, Iran poses a real challenge to the United States and our partners and a grave threat to our ally Israel. It continues to destabilize countries from Yemen to Lebanon, while exacerbating the conflict in Syria. It is developing missiles that can strike every country in the Middle East. And it fuels terrorism throughout the region and beyond, including through direct support to Hamas and Hizballah. We have to broadly confront and raise the costs for Iran\u2019s destabilizing activities...\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s real liberal internationalism, and I hope she spells out in the coming weeks what \u201cbroadly confront\u201d means. I\u2019d rather have her doing it than Jeb Bush or Scott Walker.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:53.645+0000"}
{"entityId": 1662, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Jeb has moved from far right toward the center. Walker\u2019s done the opposite. Why can\u2019t anyone just take a consistent position and defend it?\n\nScott Walker and Jeb Bush were bound to collide sooner or later. It turned out to be sooner.\n\nAs the son of a Baptist minister, and the son of the 41st president of the United States, these two were destined to be the odd couple of the 2016 election. Walker is running against the establishment and the Washington elites. Bush embodies both. Walker will need at least $100 million to compete in the GOP primary, and more if he makes it to the general. Most of the Republican donors who write those kinds of checks are on Bush\u2019s speed dial.\n\nBush could be successful in a general election but he first must survive what is likely to be a brutal primary battle for the GOP nomination. He\u2019ll have to convince far-right voters that he is conservative enough, and those are some of the very people who seem so enamored of Walker. Small world.\n\nThe collision was over immigration. During a recent trip to New Hampshire, Bush was asked by a reporter if he believed the Wisconsin governor had changed his views on the issue to appeal to the far right.\n\n\u201cHe changed his views on immigration,\u201d Bush said of Walker.\n\nBush knows a lot about change. On this issue, the former Florida governor has done some flipping and flopping himself.\n\nAs of this moment, Bush supports a kind of comprehensive immigration reform not unlike what his brother, President George W. Bush, proposed more than 10 years ago: border security, guest workers, and eventual legal status for undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cThe best plan, the most realistic plan, the grown-up plan, once you control the border ... is to say, \u2018Let these folks achieve, earn legal status,\u2019\u201d Bush said during the same trip to New Hampshire. \u201cIf we just keep people in the shadows, we\u2019re not going to solve our immigration problems.\u201d\n\nAll of which leads me to ask: When the topic at hand is immigration, how many Jeb Bushes are there anyway?\n\nFor Walker and his loyal followers on the right\u2014the Walkeristas\u2014that kind of thinking is the problem. They hear what Bush and his many supporters in the Republican establishment and business circles consider to be real immigration reform and the only word that flashes into their heads, in big red letters, is \u201cAMNESTY.\u201d They define that concept, narrowly, as anything that allows the undocumented a way to escape deportation and legally remain in the United States.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Fox News Sunday, Walker made his views plain and couldn\u2019t resist using the \u201ca-word.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don't believe in amnesty, and part of the reason why I've made that a firm position is I look at the way this president has mishandled that issue,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI think the better approach is to enforce the laws and to give employers, job creators, the tools like E-Verify and other things to make sure the law is being upheld going forward.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Walker may not \u201cbelieve in amnesty\u201d now. But, not long ago, he sure sounded like a believer.\n\nIn July 2013, Walker sat down for an interview with the editorial board of the Wausau (Wisc.) Daily Herald. He was asked his view on immigration reform, and whether he supported a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. His response, according to a video of the meeting: \u201cI think it makes sense.\u201d Walker explained that any accommodation for the undocumented should be part of an overall \u201cfix\u201d of the immigration problem. But despite protests by the governor that the newspaper had quoted him \u201cerroneously,\u201d there is no denying that he approved of giving citizenship to illegal immigrants.\n\nAnd now, Walker may have returned to the stance that he had previously taken and later disavowed. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that, this month, at a private dinner of Republicans in New Hampshire, Walker expressed support for allowing undocumented immigrants to stay in the country and eventually apply for citizenship. This is the first time we\u2019ve heard this, and it further muddies Walker\u2019s position.\n\nWhat will the Walkeristas\u2014not to mention assorted members of the Tea Party\u2014say about that? Sounds like Walker himself has a pretty good idea what they\u2019d say, because the same afternoon the Journal posted its piece, a Walker spokeswoman said, \u201cWe strongly dispute this account.\u201d\n\n\n\nBut Walker isn\u2019t alone. Bush has also had trouble being consistent on the immigration issue. First, he may claim now that he wants to get people out of \u201cthe shadows.\u201d But in January, during a speech in San Francisco, he seemed more eager to get illegal immigrants out of the country. In those remarks, Bush zeroed in on those people who overstayed their visas, and said: \u201cWe ought to be able to find where they are and politely ask them to leave.\u201d\n\nAlso, on the issue of giving undocumented a path to citizenship, Bush has said that he supports the idea, and has even suggested an \u201caccelerated\u201d path for young people brought here as children by their parents. But, in his book Immigration Wars (co-authored by Clint Bolick), Bush comes out against a path to citizenship. His most recent position is that he could support a pathway if it were proposed by Congress. Does that mean he no longer opposes it? Who can decipher this?\n\nNext, Bush opposed the Arizona immigration law, which roped local cops into enforcing federal immigration law and promoted ethnic profiling of Latinos. But again, in his book, he said that he supports letting local police be \u201cthe eyes and ears\u201d of the Border Patrol. That\u2019s the essence of the Arizona law.\n\nFinally, Bush tells conservative audiences that any reforms to allow the undocumented to remain in the United States will only be possible once the U.S.-Mexico border is secure. It\u2019s a message that has been reinforced by Bush aides. Yet, a few years ago, during an interview with Univision, Bush insisted that it was \u201cnot possible in a free country to completely control the border without us losing our freedoms and liberties.\u201d\n\nAll of which leads me to ask: When the topic at hand is immigration, how many Jeb Bushes are there anyway?\n\n\n\nWalker and Bush certainly aren\u2019t the only politicians on the planet who have altered their views on immigration.\n\nJust about every elected official in both parties who has ever taken on the issue has wound up in a different place than where he started. They\u2019ve changed course, told whoppers, misled constituents, broken promises, pretended to be something they\u2019re not, and spoken out of both sides of their mouths.\n\nWhy? Survival. Most politicians worship at the altar of re-election. And so they\u2019re leery of issues that can trip them up, cause them trouble, or cost them votes.\n\nImmigration is just such an issue. It actually splits the parties.\n\nDemocrats have to referee an intramural brawl between two core constituencies: Latinos who want to give undocumented immigrants, most of whom are also Latino, a path to legal status if not outright citizenship, versus white and African-American blue-collar workers who feel threatened by immigrant labor and want to give the undocumented a one-way bus ticket home.\n\nRepublicans have an internal scuffle of their own: Nativists who want fewer immigrants, whether they came legally or illegally, because they fear the changing complexion of the United States, versus business interests that want more immigrant labor and are willing to look the other way if the immigrants come illegally, because they fear that Americans won\u2019t do the jobs they need filled.\n\nHow does an elected official, in either party, cater to one of his constituencies without ticking off the other?\n\nThat\u2019s the key question. Up to now, neither Bush nor Walker have come up with an answer.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:53.835+0000"}
{"entityId": 1663, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "OK, we don\u2019t have many details yet, and she could work on the populist anger. But Hillary Clinton has identified the main economic crisis of our time.\n\nHere\u2019s one thing I\u2019m sure of about the economic speech Hillary Clinton gave Monday morning at the New School: If a relatively unknown Democratic governor of Illinois or Michigan were running for president, and he gave the speech Hillary Clinton gave Monday morning at the New School, rank-and-file liberals would be turning rapturous cartwheels. She correctly identified the central economic problem of our time; she talked very clearly about the kinds of solutions she\u2019d pursue to address it; she even tossed a few threats in Wall Street\u2019s direction.\n\nThe problem is the wages of middle-class workers. The solutions are varied but boil down to a range of policies that would do two things: one, give corporations incentives to share profits and think less about short-term profit-maximization; two, help middle-class families meet the life expenses (college tuition, day care, etc.) that have increased greatly over the last 20 years while wages have remained stagnant. And as to Wall Streeters who gamble with middle-class people\u2019s money, she said, \u201cWe will prosecute individuals and firms\u201d who do so. She used the word \u201ccriminal\u201d in this context more than once.\n\nMy hypothetical governor giving exactly this speech would be showered with liberal praise. But Clinton says it, and it\u2019s like so what. She faces too much distrust from liberals over her past centrism; and for the moment everybody\u2019s all Bernie Bernie Bernie. And that\u2019s all fine. Sanders is fun and sometimes exhilarating, and a primary contest needs a candidate who can speak the unvarnished truth.\n\nBut it\u2019s the speakers of varnished truth who usually win presidential nominations, and Clinton is at least 90 percent likely to win this one. And as varnished truths go in Democratic presidential politics, Clinton\u2019s are about as liberal as any liberal could reasonably hope for. There\u2019s an art to taking it right up to line, but not an inch past, and she\u2019s doing that.\n\nOne way of testing whether proposals have any ideological bite to them is to imagine whether anyone from the other party could put them forward. Everyone can and will say they want to help the middle class. But how? Jeb Bush says with 4 percent growth into infinity. First of all this is a big fat lie of a promise, and he\u2019s surely smart enough to know he\u2019s lying. From 1975 to 2014 (for 40 years), annual GDP growth in the United States averaged 2.79 percent, according to World Bank data (the stuff I used came in the form of an Excel spreadsheet, so there\u2019s no URL, but Google something like \u201cReal Historical Gross Domestic Product\u201d and you\u2019ll find it). So it doesn\u2019t happen. The best years of sustained GDP growth we\u2019ve ever had were under\u2014yep\u2014Bill Clinton, but even in the late 1990s, we had only four straight years of plus-4-percent growth, and that\u2019s a modern record (there was a three-year run under Ronald Reagan from 1983-1985).\n\nThere\u2019s an art to taking it right up to line, but not an inch past, and she\u2019s doing that.\n\nSo it\u2019s a lie, number one, but more importantly, it means nothing as a measure. No, actually, it means something, and what it means is toxic: It means that if we actually do experience growth at 4 percent but without taking any of the ameliorative measures Clinton is talking about, the main impact of that growth will be to give us more inequality, more wage stagnation, more corporate profit-hoarding, more stock buybacks, and more roulette-wheel banking. Bush\u2019s is a flawed way of looking at the economy, and this is a very old point of contention between right and left; As Robert Kennedy once said, GDP \u201cmeasures everything, in short, except that which makes life worthwhile.\u201d\n\nClinton is talking about growth too, but she\u2019s emphasizing equitable growth. And she puts forward numerous proposals that no Republican would touch, from raising the minimum wage\u2014remember, Bush wants no federal minimum wage\u2014to strengthening unions to offering paid family leave to cracking down on employers who misclassify workers as contractors to expanding on Dodd-Frank to endorsing the Buffett Rule, which applies a minimum effective tax rate of 30 percent on earners north of $1 million.\n\nShe left a lot of the details for later, and she was fuzzy here and there\u2014she was noncommittal on trade, and it will be interesting to hear what \u201cdefending and enhancing\u201d Social Security actually means.\n\nBut for now, it\u2019s enough that she\u2019s linking the concepts of fairness and growth and that she\u2019s making that link the centerpiece of her economic agenda. This is important because until very recently, the economics profession hasn\u2019t regarded fairness as anything it should care about. But that has begun to change. This was the big question in my mind last year as I contemplated Clinton\u2019s candidacy last year. Believe me, I had no small amount of doubt about how aggressively she\u2019d embrace the equitable growth proposition. I\u2019d say she\u2019s answered my questions. Last year, on her book tour, she pooh-poohed paid family leave. Now it\u2019s a centerpiece of her platform.\n\nIt\u2019s still going to take time for liberals to believe this, and of course some never will. This is where Clinton still has some work to do. When it comes to economics, liberals don\u2019t really want to hear policy proposals. They want to hear FDR-style attacks on the economic royalists. This is not something Clinton is known for, to put it mildly. I don\u2019t think anyone expects her to be Elizabeth Warren, but in her own way, she has to go there, especially when you consider that she might become the wealthiest president in modern times.\n\nThis, from the speech, started moving in that direction, and it\u2019s the first time I recall her talking like this: \u201cAnd while institutions have paid large fines and in some cases admitted guilt, too often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences\u2014or none at all, even when they\u2019ve already pocketed the gains. This is wrong and, on my watch, it will change.\u201d\n\nMaybe if she keeps this up and the royalists start attacking her, and she stands her ground, the Warrenites will finally come around. In the meantime, liberals ought at least to recognize that the old cautious Hillary they have in their minds would never have gone this far this fast.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:53.977+0000"}

Not yet.\n\nBy announcing so close to the debate, Kasich could get a bump of a percentage or two that would put him just inside the top tier. His announcement was followed by an appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s show, a three-day swing through New Hampshire, then on to stops in Iowa and South Carolina. In short, he\u2019s going to be everywhere.\n\nOne Ohio Republican strategist with knowledge of the governor\u2019s strategy said the old-fashioned barn-storming, coupled with TV appearances and ads from Kasich\u2019s Super PAC, could give him the needed boost to get into the main stage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely vital he\u2019s in the debate, it\u2019s his home state,\u201d the Republican said.\n\nMeanwhile, former Texas governor Rick Perry has talked his way back into the news cycle by aggressively going after Trump.

Before that, Perry had been extremely critical of Trump\u2019s comments on immigration.\n\nAnd their fight doesn\u2019t end there. As Trump launched withering criticism on Perry from the South Carolina stage\u2014he suggested numerous times that Perry was just too dumb to be president\u2014Perry\u2019s campaign retweeted old Donald Trump missives praising the then-Texas governor.\n\n\u201cRick Perry is right when he says we must stand by Israel in the UN,\u201d said one tweet from September 2011.\n\n\u201cRick Perry\u2014a good man, a great family and a patriot,\u201d said another from January 2012.\n\nAnd so on.\n\nBut did attacking Trump really raise Perry\u2019s profile? Maybe.\n\nAfter all, in a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, Perry jumped from 1 percent to 4 percent in the field. And since 0.5 percent is all that currently separates those who are in and those who will be banished to the B-list debate, why not give hitting it a try?\n\nBut actually it might not be that easy, said Jeff Horwitt, a vice president at Hart Research Associates, a D.C.-based polling firm.\n\nHorwitt said Perry\u2019s bump could be in the margin of error\u2014since moving polling numbers significantly is harder than it looks.\n\n\u201cThe criteria for the Fox News debate does put the lower-tier candidates in a somewhat unique position at this early stage of trying to attach themselves to the news of the day and make themselves relevant so they can hold on and be one of the 10 candidates standing on the stage,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cWhile the race is incredibly fluid at this early stage, it is going to take more than nipping at the heels of more relevant first-tier candidates to really move poll numbers.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of, Carly Fiorina has been fond of slamming Hillary Clinton and drawing comparisons between their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, which has earned her some headlines in her first months of the campaign.\n\nBut in the run-up to the final week before the debate, Fiorina\u2019s campaign is taking the more conventional route, introducing the candidate to voters and traveling to early states like Iowa, which she will visit this week.\n\nFor his part, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who, thanks to Trump, no longer gets the \u201cmost blunt\u201d award in the field, told reporters on Monday he wasn\u2019t worried about getting into the debate.\n\n\u201cThe source of my confidence is that the people behind me aren\u2019t gonna catch me and I\u2019m more likely to move up than I will to move down,\u201d Christie said during a campaign stop in South Carolina, according to a transcript of his remarks. \u201cSo, I\u2019ll be there. I know there are some who hope I\u2019m not. But, I\u2019ll be there. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d\n\nBut Horwitt said, at the end of the day, getting up in the polls and staying there all comes down to the basics.\n\n\u201cIt comes back to the fundamentals that separate first-tier from lower-tier candidates,\u201d he said. \u201cMoney, organization, and a uniquely clear and compelling rationale for your own candidacy.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:54.821+0000"}

Yelp reviewers say it\u2019s \u201cVery, very average and dated,\u201d and \u201cThere was a USED DIRTY UNDERSHIRT on the bed when we walked into the room.\u201d The rate for a room this evening is $137. Liberty, of course, is priceless.\n\nTuesday\u2019s announcement was a long time in the making.\n\nThe junior senator from Kentucky has been unsubtly campaigning for the Republican nomination for the better part of the last year. He has toured the country giving speeches, raising money, and waging war on Hillary Clinton and potential GOP rivals. He has, put simply, done everything short of say, \u201cI\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nPaul is, he would very much like you to know, different from other politicians. He is decidedly not slick: He speaks quietly and slowly, and often sounds as though he is in the middle of trying to figure out what he thinks of something while answering a question. He is not a natural when it comes to retail politics. At events, like a foreign policy speech in New York in the fall, he can be seen sitting, with his legs outstretched and his eyes glued to the table below him, half-heartedly picking at a piece of pie.\n\nHis voice seems to grow hoarse quickly from public speaking and making small talk with voters. All of which communicates the message that Paul really isn\u2019t in this game because he\u2019s good at bullshitting and backslapping.\n\nNot that he\u2019s been in the game for very long. Paul has only been in politics for five years. He entered the Senate in 2010 after getting elected on the strength of the support of his father, libertarian icon Ron Paul (who will, The New York Times\u2019 Jeremy Peters reported, be in attendance Tuesday).\n\nBefore that, Rand Paul was an eye doctor who sometimes dabbled in anti-tax activism and volunteered on his dad\u2019s campaigns.\n\nBut like many kids, as Rand has come into his own, things have gotten complicated with his dad.\n\nPaul is now in the often uncomfortable position of having to appease his father\u2019s libertarian-leaning supporters while moving enough toward the center not to scare off Republican primary voters.\n\nPaul is now in the often uncomfortable position of having to appease his father\u2019s libertarian-leaning supporters while moving enough toward the center to not scare off Republican primary voters.\n\nIt\u2019s a delicate dance, and he has already stumbled while trying to navigate on issues of foreign policy, specifically how to address the rise of ISIS (bomb them in Iraq and Syria, he decided, but formally declare war).\n\nBut Paul\u2019s subtle shift toward a more hawkish foreign policy has not endeared him to authentic interventionists, who regard him as an isolationist nut like his father. They oppose him so fervently that, Bloomberg View\u2019s Josh Rogin reported Monday, one group\u2014the Foundation for a Secure and Prosperous America\u2014is launching a million-dollar ad campaign against him on Tuesday.\n\nBut that\u2019s an issue for a different day.\n\nOn Monday, Paul was sitting in an SUV with his family, taking the two-hour, 116-mile drive from his hometown of Bowling Green to the Galt House.\n\nHis staff, meanwhile, was roaming the halls of the Galt House. There was Doug Stafford, Paul\u2019s main political adviser, who arrived here on Easter with his family. Holding an iced coffee on the third floor was Elise Jordan, a former speechwriter for Condoleezza Rice who, for the last few months, has served as an informal communications and foreign policy adviser for Paul and will be given a prominent communications position on the campaign.\n\nOnce Paul arrived here in Louisville, he was to attend dinner and a party in his honor and finally, end the night at Patrick O\u2019Shea\u2019s, an Irish pub a short walk from the hotel, where he planned to watch the NCAA championship game with the rest of his staff and members of the media.\n\nAn estimated 1,000 people are expected to show up to the Galt House ballroom to hear Paul\u2019s speech on Tuesday. Paul will, a source with knowledge of the event told me, be introduced first by a video highlighting his record as an ophthalmologist, then by a Kentucky doctor, and finally by his wife, Kelley Paul.\n\nPaul will walk out onstage to a song he has chosen from a list of about 10 rock songs by artists like Metallica and AC/DC (Paul\u2019s campaign has a deal with ASCAP and BMI.)\n\nThe source told me Paul will touch on all the obvious notes: debt (bad), tax cuts (good), peace through strength (also good), standing up to terrorists (great), nation building (bad). The source said the speech will focus on the big picture, and Paul will not make any specific policy proposals.\n\nIn an effort to hype Tuesday\u2019s event, Paul released a 2:43 video collage, titled \u201cDefeat the Washington machine/Unleash American Dream,\u201d on Sunday evening, consisting mostly of cable pundits talking about how \u201cinteresting\u201d he is, set to vaguely movie trailer-reminiscent rock music\u2014a preview, of sorts, of what fans can expect Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time for a new way,\u201d he says in the clip. \u201c A new set of ideas.

{"entityId": 1667, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "We cherish our freedoms? Value our privacy? Sort of. But the polls show we value our safety. So most of us don\u2019t mind being lied to.\n\nHeadlines abound touting the new curbs to our government\u2019s domestic spying program signed into law Tuesday by Presidents Obama. We see it described as \u201clandmark legislation ending the government\u2019s bulk telephone data dragnet\u201d and as a \u201clegislative overhaul\u201d to end the government\u2019s \u201ccollection of private telephone records.\u201d\n\nThis new law, known as the USA Freedom Act, purportedly provides that our government will stop collecting wholesale data on our phone calls. But let me ask you something: Do you actually believe our intelligence agencies will stop spying on us? Seriously, deep down, do you think our government will actually end this program that it claims has been keeping us safe?\n\nI doubt many of you do. Our overall trust in the government is all but gone. Indeed, a poll released a few months ago found Americans\u2019 trust in our government to do the \u201cright thing\u201d is at 13 percent, which is the lowest level in the 55 years of measuring that issue, even lower than in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal.\n\nAnd how can we be expected to trust the government especially on the issue of domestic spying given its recent track record?! After all, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath about the NSA surveillance programs to Congress in 2013? For those who may have forgotten, on March 12, 2013, Clapper appeared before the U.S. Select Committee on Intelligence where this exchange took place between Senator Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Clapper:\n\nWyden: \u201cDoes the NSA collect any type of data at all on millions, or hundreds of millions of Americans?\u201d\n\nClapper: \u201cNo, sir.\u201d\n\nWyden: \u201cIt does not?\u201d\n\nClapper: \u201cNot wittingly. There are cases where they could inadvertently, perhaps, collect, but not wittingly.\u201d\n\nA few months later Edward Snowden leaked documents showing that the NSA had been collecting massive amounts of metadata from phone companies about calls made by U.S. citizens. After this discourse, Clapper first defended his original answer to Congress but then ultimately admitted that his response was \u201cerroneous.\u201d\n\nNow if Clapper had been fired and indicted for perjury, at least then it would have given us the sense that the government valued being honest with us. Instead Clapper still serves as the director of national intelligence while Snowden remains in Russia, in essence a fugitive.\n\nSo how is it that privacy can be so important to so many yet we see a solid majority contradict that by supporting the government\u2019s spying program? The answer is fear.\n\nSo, no, we don\u2019t trust the government. But do we care if the government invades our privacy as long as it keeps us safe? Obviously some people, including myself, care a great deal about it. Our nation\u2019s Founding Fathers enshrined a right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment. It is truly one of the bedrock principles our nation was founded upon, namely that we have a \u201cright\u201d to be secure in our \u201cpersons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures\u201d by the government. And that \u201cshall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause.\u201d\n\nBut a CNN poll released Monday found that 61 percent of Americans, including majorities of both Democrats and Republicans, support the NSA\u2019s domestic surveillance program. So does this mean that most Americans truly do not care about privacy?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not that simple. Other polls show that when questions concerning privacy are asked, Americans overwhelmingly support the principle of not having others snoop into our lives. In fact, a Pew poll released just two weeks ago found that 74 percent of Americans think it is \u201cvery important\u201d to be \u201cin control of who can get info about you.\u201d\n\nSo how is it that privacy can be so important to so many yet we see a solid majority contradict that by supporting the government\u2019s spying program? The answer is fear. When we are afraid, we are willing to give up freedoms for that. And we have been a scared people since 9/11.\n\nAs Rand Paul, a person who I don\u2019t agree with often, stated Monday on Laura Ingraham\u2019s radio show (a person with whom I never agree) when asked about why some support a loss of liberty: \u201cOften we use fear, and we say, \u2018We won\u2019t be able to catch terrorists.\u2019\u201d\n\nPaul then asked how much of our civil liberties are we prepared to lose, \u201cSo should we put television monitors in every house to try to prevent terrorist attacks?\u201d Paul added, \u201cThere is a zero-sum game here that leads us down a slippery slope to where there would be no freedom left.\u201d\n\nPaul is right. With the advances in technology, who knows how the government will be able to monitor us in the future? Perhaps via our TV monitors, as Paul suggests, or things we can\u2019t even imagine at this time.\n\nI don\u2019t think most Americans truly want a loss of liberties or the \u201cfreedoms\u201d that the neocons claimed Bin Laden wanted to take from us. But they do want to be safe.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just best to let the government lie to us like Clapper did. I\u2019m sure some view Clapper\u2019s lie as not being sinister in intent but more akin to a \u201cgood lie\u201d in the sense of Mark Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn, when Huck lied to save the life of his black friend Jim.\n\nSo what do we want: honesty and less security, or lies and safety?

And finally, they set it up as Canadian so that other Canadians could contribute and receive the usual tax credit.\n\nUPDATE: The $2.35 million in question was not from Giustra. It came from Ian Telfer, a friend of Giustra's. Telfer also made other donations to the foundation of up to $5.6 million that according to The New York Times were reported\n\nOkay, whatever. Sounds quasi-plausible, I guess. But to most of Washington and some unknown percentage of Americans, it\u2019ll just sound complicated and fishy. And whether that skepticism is warranted or not, its existence is pretty obviously a fact that the Clintons will need to deal with, and they ought to deal with it sooner rather than later by announcing some clear, simple, new rules about what the foundation will and will not do if she becomes the president. They can make this issue, or \u201cissue,\u201d go away, if they want to.\n\nI\u2019d like to see Bill and Hill, and I suppose even Chelsea since her name is on the thing too, stand up and give a press conference sometime in May or June where they say the following: Yes, first, let them remind everybody of the great work the foundation has done, the lives saved, the anti-HIV drugs dispensed, the water made potable, all that. All that stuff is real. Let them say they want the foundation to continue doing this important work.\n\nBut then let them say words to the effect: \u201cHowever, we are aware of the appearances here involving some recent revelations. No one has found any smoking gun of a quid pro quo, and we\u2019re confident no one will; but we agree the standard needs to be higher than that. The presidency can\u2019t be compromised by appearances of conflict of interest. So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do, starting on X date\u201d\u2014while she\u2019s still a candidate, way before she\u2019s even president.\n\nIs there more? There\u2019s surely more. But you get the picture: The idea here is to put questions about the foundation to rest.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re gonna downsize. We\u2019re going to raise less, and we\u2019re going to do less. We\u2019re going to put a cap on the size of donations we accept (and that cap should be more like five figures than seven). We\u2019re going to move toward a fundraising model of relying more on smaller donations. We\u2019re going to disclose our donors frequently on our website\u2014not annually, not quarterly, but monthly. Bill and Chelsea are not going to accept exorbitant speaking fees anymore, because we get that to average people working hard to make $60,000 a year, that just looks kinda clammy, and we have enough money. We know that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to limit severely the kind and amount of money we accept from foreign governments and citizens. We\u2019re going to vet our donors more rigorously in terms of who might stand to profit from a decision of the executive branch, and we\u2019re going to turn down the money wherever our officers see the slightest possibility for the appearance of a conflict. And whenever an agency of the executive branch, or one of those complicated interagency bodies like the one involved in the recent brouhaha, makes a determination in an area where the foundation is doing work, we\u2019ll proactively disclose that, too.\u201d\n\nIs there more? There\u2019s surely more. But you get the picture: The idea here is to put questions about the foundation to rest.\n\nLet\u2019s go quickly through the foundation\u2019s 2013 financials. It took in $199 million in donations and $93 million in grants. Of the various initiatives those moneys fund, the Clinton Health Access Initiative is the biggest, costing $128 million (the price tag of the Clinton-Giustra partnership was just $5 million). I could be wrong here, but I don\u2019t recall seeing any negative stories about the health initiative. Why not just cut back and do only that? Who\u2019s going to argue with HIV/AIDS medications, vaccines (well, some people will argue with vaccines, but that\u2019s another story), building a health-care infrastructure in the developing world?\n\nThere\u2019s also something called the Clinton Health Matters Initiative, which is confined to doing similar good deeds in the United States. So fine, keep that. It\u2019s only $1.7 million anyway. A foundation that spends $130 million\u2014or somewhat less, assuming a new cap on the donation size\u2014improving people\u2019s health sounds to me like a perfectly respectable foundation, and I reckon most Americans would think okay, something like that seems just fine.\n\nSome kind of move like this, assuming no quid pro quo is brought to light between now and Election Day, and I think the whole controversy goes away. Most voters care less about what might have happened in the past than what they\u2019re going to do in the future. If these proposed new rules are bold\u2014if even critics have to go on cable TV and grudgingly acknowledge that they sound pretty good on paper\u2014and easy for regular people to understand, the foundation likely ceases to be an issue.\n\nQuietly on April 15, four days before most of the world knew about the Clinton Cash book from that Times story, the foundation did announce three new steps it was taking, not that anyone noticed. It\u2019s going to disclose donors quarterly instead of annually. It\u2019s going to more or less shut down the Clinton Global Initiative, or at least stop with the big glitzy events (after one that\u2019s already scheduled). And as for foreign governments, it will accept money only from Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom.\n\nIt\u2019s a start. But it isn\u2019t enough. And by the way the issue here isn\u2019t pleasing the media. The media will never be pleased with the Clintons. But they do need to think about, you know, voters. Because if these stories, full of innuendo as they may be, continue to pop up, and the Clintons don\u2019t acknowledge some error and pledge to fix it, lots of voters who might otherwise be inclined to vote for her could say \u201cenough already.\u201d\n\nLast point, and it\u2019s key: The responsibility to do something like this falls even harder on her because of the fact that she\u2019s the only Democratic game in town. If there were other plausible candidates, and the foundation story took her down during the primary season and she lost to some other equally viable nominee, that would be one thing. But there isn\u2019t another equally viable nominee. And there\u2019s too much at stake in 2016 for her to risk losing over this.

Even starting out with the huge lead that she did, Clinton can\u2019t allow Sanders to keep gaining votes while she loses votes in the hope that the bleeding won\u2019t be fatal in the long run.\n\nThinking that little tricks like getting an \u201corganizer\u201d to introduce the candidate at a rally will change an image built over four decades in politics is like McDonald\u2019s thinking they can take on Starbucks because they now sell espresso.\n\nSo far Clinton\u2019s approach has been to try to demonstrate to the element of the party that finds Sanders so appealing that she is really one of them. This seems like an extremely flawed strategy that plays directly to Sanders\u2019s strengths. If the contest is going to come down to who can be the most pure liberal, the best bet is on the guy who actually is a socialist. Particularly when running against someone with Hillary Clinton\u2019s long record of being everything that the current left of her party hates.\n\nThe truth is, Hillary Clinton has supported every U.S. war since Vietnam. She supported not only DOMA, which her husband signed, but a travel ban on those who were HIV positive. She supported welfare cuts (remember her husband\u2019s efforts toward \u201cending welfare as we know it\u201d?). She supports the death penalty and campaigned in her husband\u2019s place during the 1992 New Hampshire primary when he left to oversee the execution of an African-American man whose suicide attempt left him brain damaged.\n\nAnd if \u201cmass incarceration\u201d is a problem today, keep in mind she has long advocated for the criminal justice policies that called for locking up more people for longer periods. She supports\u2014and, as Secretary of State, participated in\u2014the U.S. policy of targeted assassinations, including when the targets were American citizens.\n\nIn a political environment in which income inequality is a rallying cry, she makes $300K plus expenses an hour. In fact, she would be the wealthiest person elected president in the modern era.\n\nWe can debate the merits of each of these positions but it\u2019s hard to argue it\u2019s not exactly the dream r\u00e9sum\u00e9 for the 2016 progressive candidate. And guess what? The politically active, motivated voters of Iowa and New Hampshire know the difference between someone who got to the White House with a DLC-backed president and a guy who went mainstream when he started calling himself a socialist and not a revolutionary.\n\nLike him or hate him, Bernie Sanders is the real deal. He\u2019s the most left-wing candidate to emerge as a serious threat to a front-runner in modern history and the faithful love him. Will he be the next president? No. But if Bernie Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in Iowa and/or New Hampshire, it is likely to set off a chain reaction that will topple Clinton.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s greatest strength\u2014more than being a woman, more than being a Clinton\u2014is the fact that polls show her consistently beating Republicans. Democrats see her as someone who can hold the White House. If she loses to Bernie in Iowa or New Hampshire, most likely the subsequent polls will show her losing to a handful of top Republicans.\n\nAnd then what happens? Will the Democratic Party rally around her?\n\nPerhaps. But more likely party voices, with great and solemn regret (masking their deep panic), will begin to say that Hillary had her chance, she fought a good fight, but we can\u2019t lose the White House.\n\nWho would get in? I still think Elizabeth Warren could be drawn in under this scenario. It\u2019s very different to get into a race to challenge the inevitable Hillary Clinton versus getting into a race to save the party from a wounded Hillary Clinton. John Kerry could get in. Who knows? Perhaps Martin O\u2019Malley does emerge as the viable alternative.\n\nSo how does Hillary Clinton avoid the danger of this scenario? Easy. She has to win Iowa and New Hampshire. She should win Iowa and New Hampshire, and handily. She\u2019s running against an obscure 73-year-old socialist from a tiny state that has few minorities and little organized labor, two of the longtime power centers in the Democratic Party.\n\nBut to beat Sanders, Clinton has to stop trying to be Sanders-lite and get about the business of explaining why he\u2019s wrong and she\u2019s right. That\u2019s how every race is won or lost. She has to lay out the case that Sanders has bad ideas\u2014and most of his are\u2014that will kill jobs and hurt people. She has to run as Hillary Clinton, not some new creation that a bunch of thirtysomething operatives put together as a poli-sci project.\n\nShe has been involved in political campaigns for longer than most of her staffers have been alive. Thinking that little tricks like getting an \u201corganizer\u201d to introduce the candidate at a rally will change an image built over four decades in politics is like McDonald\u2019s thinking they can take on Starbucks because they now sell espresso.\n\nOne of life\u2019s truths is that we all tend to become more like ourselves the older we get. If you\u2019re marrying someone over 65 with the hope they will change, the odds for success are slim.\n\nHillary Clinton, who has collected vast fortunes in campaign donations from Wall Street and hasn\u2019t driven a car in over a quarter of a century, can\u2019t win a progressive primary. So if she doesn\u2019t change the terms of the race, she\u2019s going to lose. Again.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:57.683+0000"}

But until we find a way to get money out of politics, they\u2019re all stillborn.\n\nAs the presidential primaries begin to heat up, the candidates, especially the second- and third-tier challengers to the early favorites, are pressing ever more bold ideas into the debate. Martin O\u2019Malley won the prize last week with the most ambitious Wall Street reform proposal in the campaign so far. And before O\u2019Malley, Bernie Sanders had even revived the idea of a \u201csingle payer\u201d health care system for all.\n\nRepublicans are doing the same on the right. Rand Paul has proposed \u201cblowing up\u201d the tax code, and replacing it with a single 14.5 percent rate on individuals and businesses. Three other Republicans have also jumped on the flat-tax bandwagon.\n\nThis is the stuff presidential campaigns are made for: bold ideas to capture a committed base, and launch candidates into nominations.\n\nBut to listen to these ideas requires a certain suspension of disbelief. Because putting aside the problem of divided government, none of these ideas has even a shot in Washington until we address the corrupting influence of money in politics.\n\nConsider O\u2019Malley\u2019s reform of Wall Street. The finance sector gives more to congressional campaigns than any other sector of the American economy. It spends more through super PACs than any other sector as well. And as the last eight years have taught Democrats, it spends its money strategically.\n\nIn 2008, 51 percent of finance\u2019s money went to Democrats. In 2010, that fell to 47 percent. The Democrats then enacted Dodd-Frank. Finance responded: In 2012, Democrats received 32 percent of finance\u2019s contributions. In 2014, it received 37 percent. That number is certain to fall if 2016 is a rally against Wall Street. Can the Democrats as a party afford a committed Wall Street reformer for president\u2014 at least so long as they depend on Wall Street\u2019s cash to stay competitive?\n\nThe same is true for Republicans and tax reform. The tax system is a complicated mess for many reasons. But one reason is the way it helps Congress finance its campaigns.\n\nThink about the R&D tax credit, which has been a \u201ctemporary\u201d provision in the tax code since 1981. Each time the credit is about to expire, Congress rallies support to renew the tax break from those who benefit from it. \u201cSupport\u201d means campaign contributions. As the libertarian Institute for Policy Innovation puts it, \u201cthis cycle has repeated itself for years ... Congress essentially uses this cycle to raise money for re-election, promising the industry more predictability the next time around.\u201d\n\nPractically every single important issue in Washington is now held hostage to big money, from climate change to addressing the debt.\n\nThese are not isolated examples. Practically every single important issue in Washington is now held hostage to big money, from climate change to addressing the debt. And amazingly, candidates from both parties are beginning to acknowledge this. Republicans like Lindsey Graham are openly criticizing Citizens United. And O\u2019Malley and Sanders have both endorsed fundamental changes to the way campaigns are funded\u2014at least, as Sanders said in his announcement, \u201cin the long run.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn the long run\u201d? What does Sanders believe he will get done in the short run, while Congress remains dependent on campaign cash from the very entities his reforms would dramatically affect? We live in a constitutional republic. Fundamental policy change requires Congress. But without a Congress that can act, sensibly, talk of revolution is just that.\n\nNone of these bold ideas for reform, from either Republicans or Democrats, are credible until they include a plan for liberating Congress from its corrupting dependence. Yet not a single candidate for president has offered a plan for that liberation. Almost every serious candidate acknowledges the problem. Yet none has come close to a plausible way to address it.\n\nIf these reformers are to be taken seriously, they need to give us a plan. They need to show us how they will deliver a Congress, as former governor and Republican presidential candidate Buddy Romer put it, \u201cfree to lead\u201d\u2014first. They need to identify the steps they will take immediately upon coming to office that would free Congress from special-interest money. They need to convince us those steps are plausible, and give us a reason to believe they can succeed.\n\nBecause if they can\u2019t, maybe we shouldn\u2019t be looking for another Superman or Superwoman for president. Maybe we should be looking for a leader who could make the most of a broken democracy. President Obama has done an amazing job over the past five years with a Congress that cannot function. If the reformers want us to believe they would be a president who could do more, they need to tell us how. Before we start another \u201cchange you can believe in\u201d campaign, someone needs to give us a plan that would make change believable again.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:57.946+0000"}

This is what the ex-governor says he\u2019ll do in Iraq if he is president\u2014but Obama is already doing it.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s Iraq policy sounds a lot like that of another American president\u2014but not his brother\u2019s. It\u2019s President Obama\u2019s.\n\nIn a sweeping address Tuesday evening, the former Florida governor pledged that if he were elected president, the United States would intervene more deeply in the Middle East to fight Islamic extremism. But there appear to be two competing instincts in Bush\u2019s anti-ISIS foreign policy: an Iraqi strategy that looks suspiciously like Obama\u2019s in its cautiousness, and a strategy in Syria that involves a serious escalation of American involvement.\n\n\u201cWell into this nightmare, President Obama\u2019s administration, by its own admission, has no strategy to stop it. In place of one, they are pursuing a minimalist approach of incremental escalation,\u201d Bush told a crowd at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. \u201cThe results have been a creeping U.S. involvement without any strategic results, the worst of both worlds.\u201d\n\nBush is calling for a change in America\u2019s policy in Iraq\u2014but certainly not an aggressive policy shift. Indeed, many of the things he is advocating for are being pursued by Obama and his administration. The former governor called for \u201csupport[ing] the Iraqi forces\u201d and \u201cgreater engagement with Sunni tribes,\u201d and for providing additional aid to Kurdish fighters who are fighting ISIS.\n\nThe Obama administration is supporting Iraqi forces and is already providing aid to Kurdish fighters. And on the issue of arming the Kurds directly instead of the current policy, sending aid through the central Iraqi government, an issue his fellow Republicans have raised, Bush is silent. The former Florida governor also called for the use of American airpower against ISIS fighters\u2014something the U.S.-led air campaign launched by Obama is already doing.\n\n\u201cAfter excoriating the Obama administration, what does Governor Bush propose for Iraq and ISIS? He appears to propose doing pretty much the same thing that President Obama is doing. What is he suggesting we do differently? More boots on the ground? If that is what he wants\u2014more American boots on the ground in combat in Iraq\u2014he should come out and say so,\u201d said Jake Sullivan, a senior policy adviser for Democrat Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, in a prebuttal of Bush\u2019s speech.\n\nBy delivering another speech about national security, Bush is inviting comparisons to his brother George W. Bush, the president who made the fateful decision to invade Iraq. But on Iraq policy itself, Jeb Bush sounds more like his brother\u2019s successor. Despite praising the surge implemented by the Bush administration, Jeb Bush has made no firm suggestion that additional U.S. troops be sent to Iraq.\n\n\u201cAfter excoriating the Obama administration, what does Governor Bush propose for Iraq and ISIS? He appears to propose doing pretty much the same thing that President Obama is doing.\u201d\n\nInstead, the former governor leaves open the door to more forces while pointing out that regional allies are not calling for them. \u201cWe have around 3,500 soldiers and Marines in Iraq, and more may well be needed. We do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces,\u201d he said Tuesday.\n\nThe changes Bush is calling for are slight, especially considering that Senator Lindsey Graham, a hawkish contender for the Republican presidential nomination, is calling for up to 20,000 additional ground troops in Iraq; and GOP primary front-runner Donald Trump is calling for an invasion to seize oil infrastructure in ISIS-held areas.\n\nThe former Florida governor\u2019s proposals are more minor tweaks to the role Americans would play. The United States would deploy forward air controllers to direct airstrikes, and troops already in the country would embed with the Iraqi forces they train, joining them on missions.\n\nBush\u2019s policy proposals for Syria are much more aggressive and require a substantial increase in American military might to implement.\n\nA Jeb Bush administration would create safe zones in Syria to protect civilians from ISIS and from Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad. Those would be combined with a no-fly zone, enforced by American and coalition airpower. Both are serious commitments that run the risk of dragging America even deeper into the conflict.\n\n\u201cA no-fly zone is a critical strategic step to cut off Assad, counter Iranian influence, keep the pressure on for a settlement, and prevent more needless death in a country that has seen so much of it,\u201d Bush said.\n\nCompared to Trump, Bush is a foreign policy genius. And his speech is the most detailed plan for fighting ISIS in Iraq and Syria that any Republican or Democratic presidential candidate has presented to date.\n\nBut cutting through the rhetoric, some questions remain.\n\nBush calls for additional resources to increase U.S. military capacity, a problem brought about by budget cuts known as sequestration. \u201cI assure you: The day that I become president will be the day that we turn this around and begin rebuilding the armed forces of the United States of America,\u201d he said.\n\nAn anagram of sequestration is \u201csenators quiet,\u201d and lawmakers have thus far been unable to come to an agreement on how to reverse the budget cuts in both military and non-military programs. The former Florida governor doesn\u2019t explain where the money for investing in the armed forces would come from.\n\nBush also calls the Iran nuclear agreement \u201cunwise in the extreme.\u201d But he does not outline any alternative to the Iran deal. How should America proceed once it has followed his advice and rejected the deal?\n\n\u201cIt should be rejected by the Congress of the United States of America,\u201d he said.

{"entityId": 1672, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "America has a long history of politicians mangling their words. But only Donald Trump has managed to find voters who don\u2019t really seem to mind.\n\nWilliam Gladstone, the shrewd Victorian-era prime minister of the United Kingdom, once called political speech \u201cthe art of saying nothing in many words.\u201d Today\u2019s major candidates try to perfect that art by staying relentlessly \u201con message.\u201d That\u2019s why media coverage of the early presidential campaign season so often focuses on gaffes, mistakes, and malapropisms.\n\nAnd for good reason. Campaign gaffes can produce real news. Former New Republic Editor Michael Kinsley famously defined a gaffe as a statement that inadvertently revealed something true\u2014such as views or policy plans that the politician would prefer to obscure. Kinsley\u2019s definition sprang out of reporting on a 1984 event at which President Ronald Reagan admitted to considering getting rid of the tax deduction on home mortgages.\n\nSubstantive mistakes, as when President Gerald Ford argued in 1976 that Poland wasn\u2019t dominated by the Soviet Union, get pounced on because they can be proven wrong with facts, and they challenge candidates to explain and justify themselves. Careful rehearsals of talking points have mostly eliminated these in recent years, though Texas Gov. Rick Perry didn\u2019t do himself any favors in 2012 when he forgot one of his points during an early Republican debate\u2014the \u201coops\u201d moment that came to define Perry\u2019s candidacy.\n\nBut the least consequential and most delightful campaign goofs are malapropisms, where a candidate gets tangled up in language and syntax and says something unintentionally funny. For example, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in February that one of his top priorities was \u201creforming a broken immigration system and turning it into an economic\u2014a catalytic converter for sustained economic growth.\u201d Few would think that Bush didn\u2019t know the difference between the metaphor of a catalyst (a chemical agent of change) and the automobile exhaust device, but the mistake was worthy of his famously inarticulate brother, the much misunderestimated President George W. Bush.\n\nIn a sense, Trump\u2019s attitude is his policy\u2014a stance that appeals to many potential voters who are unimpressed by carefully reasoned debate.\n\nA month earlier, when former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin\u2019s teleprompter failed during a speech at the Iowa Freedom Summit, she soldiered on, urging her audience to rise to the defense of fellow conservatives: \u201cAnd we don\u2019t sit on our thumbs this time when one of our own is being crucified and falsely accused of whatever the hip accusation of the day happens to be, right?\u201d This is what\u2019s known as a portmanteau malapropism, awkwardly fusing two related words or ideas\u2014in this case the expressions \u201csit on our hands\u201d (do nothing) and \u201ctwiddle our thumbs\u201d (waste time). The comment did little to refudiate perceptions that Palin is America\u2019s current champion malapropagandist.\n\nNor are Democrats immune to malapropisms. Boston\u2019s former mayor, the late Thomas Menino, was famous for them, notably lamenting that parking problems in the city were \u201can Alcatraz around my neck.\u201d And Vice President Joe Biden, often mentioned as a potential challenger to Hillary Clinton, once introduced his boss as \u201ca man I\u2019m proud to call my friend. A man who will be the next president of the United States\u2014Barack America!\u201d\n\nThe candidates most likely to commit malapropisms tend to be those who cultivate a folksy, plain-spoken image that insulates them from charges of elite intellectualism. Biden is a good example, even though he\u2019s a well-educated lawyer. By way of contrast, politicians such as Clinton and Barack Obama, also lawyers, cultivate a more wonkish, academic image, choosing their words precisely and rarely stumbling over them. We may admire their precision, but they\u2019re not as much fun to read and write about.\n\nThis summer much attention has focused on the candidacy of celebrity businessman Donald Trump, who cultivates the image of a no-nonsense boss. Trump is not known for malapropisms, and has seemed unafraid of gaffes and mistakes that would damage other candidates. So far, courting controversy has worked for him: His poll standing has risen despite impolitic comments on immigration and the patriotism of rivals.\n\nIndeed, Trump\u2019s fearless insistence that he is right on all points, and his scorn of the need to apologize or correct himself, is in its own way \u201csaying nothing in so many words.\u201d He makes no attempt to explain his assertions with detailed policies, and seeks to shut down the conversation by sheer force of personality.\n\nIn a sense, Trump\u2019s attitude is his policy\u2014a stance that appeals to many potential voters who are unimpressed by carefully reasoned debate.

But in my lifetime, there were certain episodes that I was very glad our government was willing to talk to other governments that were considered evil and monstrous.\u201d\n\nDrafted into the military in 1962, Paul said, \u201cDo you think I complained when Kennedy called up Khrushchev and said, \u2018Hey, maybe there\u2019s a better way? You take your weapons out of Cuba and I\u2019ll take \u2019em out of Turkey,\u2019 and the thing was over. So I would say that diplomatic conversation was very beneficial. So, to say that the Iranians aren\u2019t perfect people and we shouldn\u2019t talk to them? You know, we have been so obsessed, for probably 30 years, on the emergency of a nuclear weapon next week, next month, or next year\u2014on a weapon that doesn\u2019t exist. The Soviets had 30,000 of them, and then they\u2019d come back to us and say that we\u2019re a bunch of kooks for wanting to talk to these bad people? I would say that the advice is that friendship is a wise idea.\u201d\n\nWhen the younger Paul first began testing the waters for a presidential run, in spring 2014, one of his pseudo-campaign\u2019s central priorities, it seemed, was to dispel the notion that he was his father\u2019s clone. The emancipation is now complete, but the effect has been catastrophic for his presidential ambitions. Being a watered-down version of Ron Paul, the evidence suggests, doesn\u2019t make Rand Paul more appealing to other factions of the GOP his dad couldn\u2019t reach\u2014it just makes him less appealing to his natural base of supporters.\n\nNo one can know what goes on within a family, of course. But the elder Paul seemed to be sending a message to his son during his hourlong remarks.\n\nAt another point in the speech, he noted that in the presidential race, \u201cThere\u2019s two individuals right now who have sort of caught the attention: Trump and Sanders.\u201d\n\nHis son, who is polling at 6 percent\u2014behind not just Trump but Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee\u2014did not receive a mention.\n\nUpdate: Doug Stafford, a senior adviser for the campaign, sent me an email taking issue with the \u201cpremise\u201d of this story. He included a statement which does not contradict the premise of this story at all, but I\u2019m including it here nevertheless: \u201cBeing against a bad deal that is the product of bad diplomacy does not make one against diplomacy. In fact, Senator Paul has stated before, during and after these negotiations that he favors diplomacy and negotiations. He still favors them. He would leave the current interim deal in place and keep going as he has said publicly several times. He also believes in negotiating from strength as Reagan did, and believes this administration has failed to do that and came up with a deal that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:59.316+0000"}

And Scott Walker is no exception.\n\nThe 2011 protests against Governor Scott Walker\u2019s collective bargaining overhaul made for an emotionally challenging day for one intern.\n\nThe intern in question was working for a conservative think tank called the MacIver Institute, and his superiors sent him up to the capitol with a video camera to tape the protesters at their wackiest.\n\nWhen one protester spotted him and realized who he was with, he gave chase, yelling profanity.\n\n\u201cI felt bad,\u201d said Brett Healey, the president of the MacIver Institute, who relayed to me this tale\u2014noting the intern escaped unharmed and the protester apologized. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have to call his mom and say, \u2018Your son got into an altercation his first day.\u2019\u201d\n\nHis mom shouldn\u2019t have been surprised.\n\nAfter Democrats took full control of the state government in 2008, there was a Cambrian explosion of conservative organizations that have worked overtime to push the historically progressive state in a rapidly rightward direction.\n\nAnd while Walker\u2019s ascent on the national political scene (and, of course, in the Republican presidential sweepstakes) has been quick, dramatic, and seemingly inexorable, he couldn\u2019t have zipped to the top of the polls without the conservative groups that have propelled his rise and repelled his enemies.\n\nPerhaps more than any other candidate eyeing the Oval Office, Walker has benefitted from home-state organizers and funders who have mastered the art of defending conservatives and making their foes look like dopes. And the MacIver Institute has been right in the thick of it.\n\nMacIver, along with a host of other conservative groups, is backed in part by the Bradley Foundation, which has built a tiny empire in the Midwestern state and had substantial influence on Walker\u2019s conservative agenda.\n\nBradley-backed groups have helped expedite Walker\u2019s ascent to power, and their success shows just how much clout wealthy donors and strategic activists can have on the way a state gets governed.\n\nThis is a long story, so I\u2019ll try to be concise.\n\nIn 2008, Wisconsin Republicans got totally shellacked.\n\nBy the end of Election Night, Democratic Governor Jim Doyle had cruised to re-election and his party controlled both chambers of the state legislature. One Wisconsin Democratic consultant said his party had a sort of embarrassment of riches; they\u2019d had a great year in 2006 as well, so they found themselves with lots of power but (comparatively) little in the way of long-term strategy. Those were the salad days.\n\nThey didn\u2019t last.\n\nAround the time of the Tea Party wave, deep-pocketed Republicans started investing heavily in conservative infrastructure.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported in 2011, in an in-depth look at the organization , that the Bradley Foundation spent more than $350 million between 2001 and 2010 to support a host of philanthropic endeavors, including arts organizations and national policy groups. Recipients included the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, and Reason magazine.\n\nConservative activists in Wisconsin have been beneficiaries of much of that largesse.\n\nIn the Badger State, the Bradley Foundation has helped fund MacIver, as well as Media Trackers\u2014a group that digs for dirt on Democrats\u2014and the Wisconsin Reporter, a conservative news site that is a project of the Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, according to Wisconsin-based Cap Times . Bradley also helps fund the Wisconsin chapter of American Majority, a conservative organization that trains activists on how to volunteer on campaigns, do issue advocacy, and run for office.\n\nMatt Batzel, American Majority\u2019s national executive director, said its Wisconsin chapter has had about 140 activist training sessions since 2010. Among the people they\u2019ve trained, 128 have gone on to win races for local- or state-level offices in the state.\n\nSince they got hosed in 2008, conservative influence in the state has metastasized rapidly.\n\nBut Walker was their crown jewel.\n\nThese days behind every great man is a great think tank. And Scott Walker is no exception.\n\nIn 2010, Walker won the governorship, Republicans took control of the majority of the state\u2019s congressional delegation, and Democrats lost both chambers of the state legislature.\n\nLiberals were agog.\n\nNow, pretend you\u2019re Scott Walker and you\u2019ve just gotten inaugurated on a cold January day in 2011. You\u2019re governing a state that birthed the modern labor movement and that\u2019s been a stronghold for the blue-collar Democrats for most of the modern era. You\u2019re in power, but your situation is\u2014to put it lightly\u2014precarious. How do you govern? If you were a typical governor in a typical version of that scenario, you would govern very, very cautiously. You would tiptoe. You would hedge. You would compromise. You would be Mitt Romney.\n\nBut Scott Walker is not Mitt Romney. And a large part of the reason he implemented such a proactively conservative agenda\u2014defunding Planned Parenthood, dramatically curtailing public-sector unions\u2019 power, passing Right to Work legislation\u2014is because of the conservative infrastructure that simultaneously pushed him in that direction and made that direction an easy way to go.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the collective bargaining overhaul, known as Act 10.\n\nA few weeks after Walker won the race for governor, MacIver\u2019s then-communications director, Brian Fraley, wrote an op-ed arguing for changes in the laws regarding public-sector unions and collective bargaining. That op-ed is widely seen as the blueprint for Act 10.\n\n\u201cWe used to be a state where we make things,\u201d wrote Fraley. \u201cNow we are a state that makes excuses for why the government behemoth cannot be tamed. That must change.\u201d\n\nAnd that changed.\n\nJust two months after Walker\u2019s inauguration, he signed Act 10 and set off protests of Biblical proportions.\n\nMacIver not only helped lay the policy groundwork for Act 10, it also helped manage its aftermath.\n\nThough the organization is a think tank, it also has an effective media arm.\n\nMacIver sent staff members out with cameras to cover the protests, chatting up activists and making YouTube videos of the more eyebrow-raising encounters.\n\nA handful of MacIver videos went viral, got picked up by the Drudge Report, and nabbed national cable news coverage. One particularly popular video showed protesters writing fake doctor\u2019s notes so their fellow activists wouldn\u2019t get in trouble for skipping work.\n\nCritics charged there were problems with the video , and Democratic state Senator Chris Larson said it was \u201cessentially made up.\u201d But the push-back was powerless.\n\n\u201c\u2018There\u2019s people giving out doctor\u2019s notes at the protests\u2014that became the dialogue,\u2019\u201d Larson said. \u201cIt ended up changing the debate.\u201d\n\nAnother MacIver viral video showed protesters wearing zombie face paint crashing an event where the governor was trying to address Special Olympics participants. Nick Novak, MacIver\u2019s director of communications, said there were many other media outlets at the event. But they didn\u2019t seem interested in the zombie attendees.\n\n\u201cIt seemed we were the only ones who were actually covering that aspect of it,\u201d Novak said.\n\nThe Wisconsin press corps has faced the same problems as other local newsrooms around the country: shrinking budgets, smaller circulations, and fewer reporters.\n\nConservative news-gathering groups like MacIver have moved into that vacuum and used their resources to push stories that reflect right-leaning values.\n\n\u201cThe media capacity to look into a governor and hold him accountable is diminishing at the same time this right-wing capacity to influence the media is increasing,\u201d said Robert Kraig, who heads the progressive Citizen Action of Wisconsin.\n\nMedia Trackers and Wisconsin Reporter, along with MacIver, have had impact. And their critics have noticed.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf there was no Bradley Foundation, there would be no Scott Walker,\u201d Larson said. \u201cThey have provided the insulation from criticism as well as the lubricant to move him forward over the last 20 years of his career.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a full-blown communication apparatus to defend whatever the governor is doing,\u201d said Kraig. \u201cThey\u2019ve given him a lot of cover, so he doesn\u2019t have to be the only target.\u201d\n\nScot Ross, who heads One Wisconsin Now, calls MacIver \u201ca propaganda factory for the failed Walker policies that have put Wisconsin near the bottom of the Midwest in job creation.\u201d\n\nOn the conservative side, activists and lawmakers are delighted with the work of MacIver and other Bradley-funded groups.\n\nRepublican state Senator Leah Vukmir added that MacIver\u2019s defense of Act 10 helped shore up support for the governor as energy on the left was growing for the recall.\n\n\u201cAll the naysayers were saying that Act 10 was the worst thing in the world, that the sky was going to fall, and that there wouldn\u2019t be enough teachers to teach classes, school sports would end,\u201d Vukmir said. \u201c[MacIver] highlighted the positive things that were happening. Those weren\u2019t easy to find in the beginning.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re kind of a combination of a think tank and media,\u201d said state Representative Dale Kooyenga, a Republican. \u201cThey\u2019re part of the whole messaging machine.\u201d\n\nHe said that MacIver was instrumental in the efforts to change the tax code that were part of the governor\u2019s 2013 budget. The think tank is also an energetic proponent of Right to Work policies like the one that Wisconsin adopted in March. Walker initially said he didn\u2019t plan to push for Right to Work. But the state\u2019s conservative legislature, with the vocal support of its conservative media establishment, pushed forward anyway.\n\n\u201cThey can get these stories into the bloodstream, they can push reforms,\u201d said Collin Roth, the managing editor of Right Wisconsin. \u201cRight to Work was a perfect example.\u201d\n\nOthers differ; Larson calls them \u201cdangerous\u201d and says they exist \u201csolely to push corporate interests.\u201d\n\nAnd now that the governor is looking to cut funds for the University of Wisconsin system as part of his 2015 budget proposal, MacIver is again playing a key role as advocate and attack dog.\n\nSo it\u2019s sort of understandable that anti-Walker protesters would chase around the MacIver Institute\u2019s junior-level interns. MacIver\u2014with the help of Bradley Foundation funding\u2014has been an integral part of Wisconsin conservatives\u2019 efforts to push Walker to the right and then to make his rightward migration politically safe.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:59.490+0000"}

They will subtly hit her on her age, her long career in the Beltway bubble, and tie her to the scandals and secrecy of her husband\u2019s administration.\n\nBut what the GOP hasn\u2019t figured out how to tackle yet is something that may be even more important than Clinton\u2019s record: the fact that if elected, she would at last break that glass ceiling and become the nation\u2019s first female president.\n\nUntil this week, both Democrats and Republicans have been approaching the subject warily. For the GOP, anything approaching gender politics is fraught with peril. In 2012, their hopes of retaking the Senate were doomed when candidates on the campaign trail mused aloud about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and whether children conceived from sexual assault were divinely sent.\n\nFor Democrats, the election season to keep in mind has been not 2012 but 2014, when their turbo-charging of rhetoric over the GOP\u2019s \u201cWar on Women\u201d led to charges of pandering. One incumbent, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, earned the moniker \u201cMark Uterus\u201d\u2014a nickname propagated by his own supporters\u2014for his singular focus on women\u2019s reproductive issues.\n\nBut no more. This week, just as the uproar over her deleted State Department emails was growing deafening, Clinton took to Twitter to blast Republicans over a sex trafficking bill that included abortion provisions, and for their delays in approving the nomination of Loretta Lynch for attorney general, calling the moves \u201cthe Congressional trifecta against women.\u201d In the last month Clinton, has appeared at a gala for Emily\u2019s List, released a report through the Clinton foundation about women and global leadership, and spoken at a United Nations conference on the status of women and girls worldwide.\n\nIn Washington, D.C, meanwhile, Concerned Women for American\u2014a religious counter to the liberal National Organization for Women\u2014convened a number of top Republican female leaders to declare the \u201cwar on women\u201d officially over.\n\n\u201cWhat do most women do every week? Do they fill up the gas tank and the grocery cart?\u201d asked GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway. \u201cOr do they get an abortion?\u201d\n\nWomen make up a majority of voters. In 2012, in the wake of a series of Republican efforts to limit reproductive health access and the aforementioned campaign gaffes, Barack Obama racked up an 11-point victory over Mitt Romney, a slightly worse showing for Democrats than they did in 2008. And even with Clinton as the likely nominee, Republican strategists are trying to limit her advantages with female voters.\n\n\u201cThe idea is to keep them in the single digits,\u201d said Katie Packer Gage, who served as a top aide to Romney in 2012 and has since started her own consulting shop dedicated to Republican outreach to women. \u201cA gender gap of over 10 points usually means a Democratic win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis week has already shown that she is running a gender-based campaign,\u201d said Conway. \u201cThere is no indication that women appreciate that, and there are many indications that men don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nGage laid out a string of attacks that Republicans were preparing to utilize against Clinton to hurt her standing among women, among them that the Clinton Foundation accepted money from \u201cregimes that don\u2019t even let women drive a car,\u201d that the top levels of her campaign are (or will be, at least) stocked mostly with men and that in office records show that she paid her male staff members more than her female ones.\n\n\u201cThe levels of hypocrisy are astounding,\u201d Gage said. \u201cShe didn\u2019t speak about these issues at all in 2008 until she was stepping out of the race, she doesn\u2019t have a great track record when it comes to equal pay. Just being a woman isn\u2019t enough.\u201d\n\nRepublicans are quick to point out that Clinton can\u2019t coast on her gender\u2014after all, she failed to rally women to her side in 2008 despite facing a Democratic primary electorate that is by some estimations close to 60 percent female.\n\n\u201cI understand the appeal of her gender,\u201d Conway told The Daily Beast. \u201cMy eyes are wide open that there may be moderate, independent-leaning women who are motivated by voting for the first women president.\u201d\n\nBut, she added, \u201cThe question is not will you vote for a woman. The question is would you vote for that woman. Does she have the values and the life experiences so that she connect with the plight of women?\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Obama also never mentioned explicitly that his election would be historic; he didn\u2019t need to. Instead, he spoke of the long sweep of American history, subtly suggesting that him in the White House would be yet another landmark toward a more equitable nation.\n\nRepublicans on the other hand are quick to accuse Clinton of already playing the gender card.\n\n\u201cThis week has already shown that she is running a gender-based campaign,\u201d said Conway. \u201cThere is no indication that women appreciate that, and there are many indications that men don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, say that they don\u2019t much have to bring up Clinton\u2019s gender\u2014they are confident that Republicans will do it for them, more often than not in boneheaded ways that end up driving female voters their way.\n\nAlready, Rand Paul has come under criticism for setting up a fake Valentine\u2019s Day Pinterest page for Clinton, with \u201clikes\u201d that included a full-length mirror and a heart-shaped bathtub.\n\nDemocrats have built a vast infrastructure around monitoring media for just such kind of GOP outburst, and will be on hair-trigger alert for any statement made on the campaign trail or on cable news that could be construed as sexist toward Clinton. On Thursday, there was already a taste of what the next 20 months could be like when an email that an aide to Rick Perry\u2019s SuperPAC wrote in 2011 in which he questioned whether a female head of state would be in \u201cGod\u2019s will\u201d made the rounds on social media.\n\nThe aide backtracked from the comments, but Clinton has been such a steady target of boorish commentary by conservative men that many Democrats are already preparing to pounce.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in their DNA. You know it\u2019s going to happen. I almost feel sorry for them,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, a senior adviser to Ready for Hillary, the SuperPAC laying the groundwork for Clinton\u2019s campaign.\n\nRepublicans, said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake, will find themselves in a few months \u201ccompeting for a very small percentage of the vote that really dislikes Hillary. And those kind of over-the top comments are more likely to get made and they can be very damaging. It\u2019s exactly that kind of thing that will reignite the \u2018War on Women.\u2019\u201d\n\nRepublicans largely avoided such controversies in 2014. But the hothouse of a presidential campaign is another matter, and as the last several cycles have shown, such off-message comments have a tendency to drive the news cycle for days and drown out whatever else a candidate is trying to convey.\n\n\u201cOur party has to rise up with one voice and condemn that kind of thing,\u201d Gage said. \u201cWe made it all the way through 2014 without any of our candidates saying anything that would give people pause. I think we learned a valuable lesson.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:37:59.675+0000"}

{"entityId": 1678, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "What a marvelous historical anomaly: Democrats are on the offense, and the GOPers sound like peaceniks on Iraq.\n\nWhat a delightful week, watching Republicans not Democrats sink in the foreign policy quicksand. For most of my adult lifetime\u2014come to think of it, all of it, and pretty much all of my entire lifetime\u2014to the extent that foreign policy has mattered in presidential campaigns, it\u2019s been brandished by Republicans to accuse the Democrats of being soft on whatever the supposed threat was at the time. To think that we might have a presidential campaign in which the Democrats are the ones playing foreign policy offense, forcing the Republicans to profess that they are not war-mongering psychopaths, would be a thing to behold\u2014as well as a measure, eight long years later, of how much damage George W. Bush and his co-belligerents did to the Republican Party.\n\nIt surely caught Jeb Bush by total surprise, the shitstorm that kicked up after his first answer about invading Iraq. Yes, he\u2019s rustier than a 1970s Plymouth; yes, he appears not to have been really quite listening to Megyn Kelly; and yes, it\u2019s beginning to dawn on all of us, God help us, that Dubya may have been the smart one.\n\nBut all those factors are subordinate to the main one, which is this: History instructs that if you\u2019re a Republican running for president and you\u2019re asked about a war, you probably can\u2019t go wrong by saying you\u2019re for it. A past war, a current war, a future war (perhaps these most of all!), it doesn\u2019t matter. Be pro-war, accuse the Democrats of wanting the United States to suckle at the teat of the UN and the new global order; and if it\u2019s a current war that\u2019s not going swimmingly, blame the Democrats and the anti-war elements at home. These are can\u2019t lose propositions.\n\nOr were. This week, Bush learned otherwise. I know, specifically it had to do with the \u201cknowing what we know now\u201d language, which is what really cranked up the media\u2019s chainsaw. But public anti-war sentiment is even more blunt than that. Here for example is a question from a Quinnipiac poll last summer: \u201cDo you think the result of the Iraq War was worth the loss of American lives and other costs of attacking Iraq, or not?\u201d This does not say \u201cknowing what we know now,\u201d which would clearly prod the respondent to think, \u201cOh, yeah, no WMD,\u201d and would be more likely to produce a higher \u201cnot worth it\u201d result.\n\nNow, the cowboys have to prove their solution to every problem isn\u2019t to invade it or bomb it.\n\nBut even keeping the WMD lie out of the conversation, not worth it won by 75-18 percent. Even Republicans said not worth it by 63-27.\n\nIt has created a new and perhaps not un- but let\u2019s say little-precedented default foreign policy position in the American electorate: Now, the cowboys have to prove their solution to every problem isn\u2019t to invade it or bomb it. This may have been true for the 1976 election, during the Vietnam hangover. But even if so, concerns about Vietnam were a distant second to unease about Richard Nixon\u2019s rape of the Constitution and Gerry Ford\u2019s pardon of him for doing it. Today, though, this question of reflexive Iraq hawkery is enough of a no-no that some people think Bush might already be sunk and should just quit now.\n\nAnd this is why we saw Marco Rubio also reverse himself last week (although he would deny that) on the Iraq War. He used to defend the war, but now, with the new Kelly Standard in play, he decided he\u2019d better come out and say: \u201cNot only would I not have been in favor of it, President [George W.] Bush wouldn't have been in favor of it and he said so.\u201d\n\nRubio, of course, has neo-conned himself to the gills, and there will be plenty of time for him during this primary season to come out swinging on Iran, once he figures out that Iran and ISIS are not allies. But that even he \u201cclarified\u201d his position in the anti-war direction says something.\n\nNow I should note: It may not play out the way I\u2019m describing during the primary campaign. Yes, as we saw above, rank-and-file Republicans said the Iraq War wasn\u2019t worth it by 63-27. But in the context of a primary season, that 27 can be as loud as or louder than the 63. It\u2019s probably the 27 who are more likely to vote or attend caucuses, which means the minority would have inordinate influence over the shape of the candidates\u2019 rhetoric.\n\nBut in a general-election context, the GOP nominee will probably have to tack back pretty quickly toward the anti-war position.

Contrary to liberals\u2019 deepest suspicions about her, she is not a neo-conservative; she is not going to have regime change in Iran on her mind, which any of the Republicans as president would, except for Rand Paul.\n\nPoor Republicans! Crime is down; they can\u2019t scream law and order. And now war is unpopular, so they can\u2019t say the Democrats are soft on whomever. Their economic theories are increasingly discredited.

Sunlight peeked through a window behind him as he addressed a crowd.\n\n\u201cFull house in Nampa, Idaho!\u201d Paul tweeted. An accompanying photo showed fewer than 100 people, seated in gold-rimmed chairs, watching him.\n\n\u201cA lot of times people ask me, \u2018Why did you decide to run for office?\u2019\u201d he began.\n\nIt\u2019s a question he might also be asking himself.\n\nNothing has gone right for Rand Paul in the last few months. His poll numbers have been in rapid decline while interest in his candidacy has waned. So this week, Paul packed up and traveled West to Alaska to try, in the words of a campaign adviser, to visit \u201cplaces other Republicans aren\u2019t going\u201d or more specifically, places overlooked by mainstream candidates but where his father, Ron Paul, performed competitively when he ran for the nomination in 2012.\n\nDonald Trump's ascent has meant that interest in every other candidate has been eclipsed, and all of Paul's efforts to shift the spotlight back onto himself have been unsuccessful. In July, as Trump took off, Paul dressed up like a high-school shop teacher and filmed himself setting the U.S. tax code on fire, mutilating it in a woodchopper, and destroying it with a chainsaw. Nobody seemed to care.\n\nBy the time of the first Republican debate in Cleveland, Paul was polling at around 6 percent. His strategy that night was to get people interested in him again by picking fights, first with Trump, whom Paul accused of being inauthentically conservative, and then with Chris Christie, with whom Paul debated the Patriot Act. It didn\u2019t work.\n\nAt this time last year, Paul was the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. He\u2019s now polling within the margin of error.\n\nOn Thursday, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed that just 2 percent of Republican or Republican-leaning voters would vote for him if the primaries were held today. He was trailing 10 other candidates: Trump, Ben Carson, Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, John Kasich, Carly Fiorina, Chris Christie and Mike Huckabee.\n\nWorse, 14 percent said they definitely would not vote for him, and 41 percent said they view him unfavorably.\n\nAt this time last year, Paul was the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. He\u2019s now polling within the margin of error.\n\nBack in 2011, when Paul first entered the Senate, his mission was simple: make peace with the establishment gatekeepers like Mitch McConnell, ensure them he wasn't as fringe in his beliefs as his dad, and then perfect the delicate balance of appealing to both them and his dad\u2019s libertarian-leaning supporters. With the support of those two camps, it seemed possible that Paul could secure the nomination.\n\nBut something went wrong: in his attempt to compromise himself enough to appeal to the McConnell\u2019s of the party, Paul seemed to lose the qualities that made him a different and therefore exciting type of Republican in the first place. He wasn\u2019t mainstream enough to win the support of the mainstream, and he wasn't libertarian enough to energize his dad's base. As a result, Paul is now finding himself no longer backing away from his father, but running towards him. His father recently sent out a fundraising appeal for the younger Paul, and on Rand\u2019s Westward journey this week he visited communities where his last name might endear him to his dad\u2019s supporters.\n\nPaul kicked off the week in Anchorage, which is not usually a high-priority campaign stop for candidates. Asked about this, Doug Stafford, Paul\u2019s senior adviser, replied, \u201cPeople live in Alaska, Olivia. You should go there. And they have delegates to the convention. Ron did well there in 2012, and we intend to build on that for 2016.\u201d\n\nRon came in third in the Alaska caucuses, but he seemed to energize the libertarian-leaning Republicans in the state. Ron zealot Russ Millette was elected chairman of the Alaska GOP in 2012 (although he was thrown out in 2013).\n\nBefore his speech in the state, Rand Paul admitted to The Washington Post\u2019s David Weigel that he didn\u2019t think his attacks on Trump were the cause of his decline. \u201cI think if you look closely at the poll numbers, our numbers actually shifted south before I ever attacked him,\u201d he said, during an interview conducted before the four-point decline evident in the new Quinnipiac poll. \u201cWe probably didn\u2019t really go after his fake conservative-ness for probably two months. During those two months, my numbers went down, and I think my numbers have stayed the same [since].\u201d\n\nAfter Alaska, Rand traveled to other Ron Paul strongholds. He stopped in Washington State, which Ron Paul won in 2012; Wyoming, where Ron came in third; Idaho, where Ron won the straw poll with over 70 percent of the vote; and Utah, where he came in second.\n\nBut whether Rand will be able to convince his dad's supporters of his legitimacy remains to be seen. This time in August 2011, Ron Paul was averaging 9.7 percent in the polls.\n\nMillette, who is not campaigning for Rand, told Weigel that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the strength of persona that Ron does. Ron is a very deep, deep thinker when it comes to libertarian philosophy. Rand may be, too, but he doesn\u2019t project it that well. If he gets the nomination, I would probably vote for him, I guess.\u201d\n\nA year ago Rand set out to broaden the appeal of his father\u2019s ideology and create a new Republican majority. But his trip this week raises the question of whether he will even fare as well as his dad did.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:01.259+0000"}
{"entityId": 1680, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Republican frontrunner says he would\u2019ve authorized the Iraq War, and so would Hillary. Let us list the ways this is totally nonsensical.\n\nThe important thing about Jeb Bush\u2019s comments about Iraq in the Megyn Kelly interview is not this dreary question of whether he is \u201chis own man.\u201d That\u2019s a psychobabble question that can only produce a lot of bad punditry. The important thing\u2014well actually, there are two: what kind of foreign policy he\u2019d give us as president, and whether he can meet some minimal standard of truth-telling. From the looks of things we should be concerned on both fronts.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the truth. He made two statements in the interview that we should parse, the first of which was probably a lie and second of which provably was. The first: \u201cI would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody.\u201d Really, particularly given what we know now?\n\nYes, she voted for the war. I\u2019m not defending her vote. It was a craven vote, just like John Kerry\u2019s was, and they never should have cast them. But does it follow that casting a vote as a senator means that, if the senator had been commander-in-chief, the senator would have chosen to pursue that kind of presidency-defining course of action? Would have put the machinery of the state to work\u2014and massive, difficult work it was, involving thousands\u2014trying to advance the lie of tying Saddam Hussein to al Qaeda and justifying a war that had nothing to do with September 11?\n\nClinton is thought of by many these days, it seems, as a gung-ho hawk, but she really wasn\u2019t that. When she voted for the war, she tried to argue that she was not voting to give the president authority to launch preemptive war. Of course she was doing exactly that, but the point for present purposes is that she wasn\u2019t saying rah, rah, let\u2019s go kill the guy. By the time she ran for president, she hadn\u2019t yet admitted her vote was a mistake, but she had voted against funding the war and pledged to start bringing troops home in 60 days of becoming president. John McCain-Lindsey Graham she was not.\n\nIn addition, Hussein was a preoccupation, not to say obsession, of the neocon right in the 1990s, not of Hillary Clinton. Bill Clinton adopted a pretty hard line toward Hussein, between the sanctions and the flyovers and the bombings, but you\u2019ll note he never sent young American infantrymen to go have their faces and limbs blown off in his country. The famous Project for a New American Century (PNAC) \u201cStatement of Principles,\u201d (PDF) released in 1997 to rebuke Clintonian drift and demand a \u201cReaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity,\u201d was signed by 25 people, and as far as I can see not a single one of them was a Democrat (that is, all the signatories are either publicly well-known Republicans or lesser-known foreign-policy types who worked for Republican, not Democratic, administrations).\n\nBill Clinton adopted a pretty hard line toward Hussein, between the sanctions and the flyovers and the bombings, but you\u2019ll note he never sent young American infantrymen to go have their faces and limbs blown off in his country.\n\nThis is important because it means that Iraq regime change simply was not a Democratic project, which to my mind makes it quite unlikely that any Democratic president, Al Gore or Hillary Clinton or anyone possibly save Joe Lieberman, would have decided that invading a country that had nothing to do with 9-11 would have constituted a reasonable response to 9-11. Twenty-nine Democratic senators, Clinton among them, cast a cowardly vote. But that hardly means that those 29 senators, if ensconced up the way on Pennsylvania Avenue, would have staked their presidencies and legacies on that war.\n\nBut that\u2019s just the appetizer, because here\u2019s the provable lie: \u201cThe intelligence that everybody saw, that the world saw, not just the United States, was, um, was faulty.\u201d This is just a monstrous falsehood that has been repeated many times by a range of neoconservatives, some with blood on their hands and others not, but it has to be slapped down.\n\nIt\u2019s important that history not be rewritten and revised: Not all the intelligence was \u201cfaulty.\u201d Think Progress did a good job on this point yesterday, citing Paul Pillar, the ex-CIA man who oversaw Middle East intelligence at the time. As Pillar has said and written on many occasions, a lot of intelligence was correct\u2014Saddam Hussein had no stockpile of WMD and posed no imminent threat to the United States. And there were journalists, like Jonathan Landay and Warren Strobel, who did great work exposing intelligence community misgivings about the administration\u2019s case for war.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t what the, ah, Cheney administration wanted to hear, so they cherry-picked bits of intelligence that would help their casus belli, and even set up ++a whole new intel operation, the Office of Special Plans, which was created precisely because the official intel wasn\u2019t saying what the administration wanted it to say, so they created an intel shop that would put out the phony product they wanted to see put out. In other words, they rejected the good intelligence and cooked up their own false intelligence, and then, when their false intelligence was revealed to be (shocker!) false, they blamed the intelligence agencies for giving them the self-same false intelligence that they cooked up.\n\nAll this tells us something, perhaps a lot, about what kind of foreign policy Bush would direct if elected. Some say he\u2019s more like his father, and Poppy\u2019s realist buddies Baker and Scowcroft, and he\u2019s not a neocon. Hard to know. But one of those 25 signers of that PNAC statement of principles was none other than Jeb Bush, then the governor of Florida. George W. was a governor then, too, but he didn\u2019t even sign it! So it seems fair to presume that Jeb believed what it said. The principles are fairly boilerplate, but even so, Bush knew what he was doing putting him name next to Cheney\u2019s and Rumsfeld\u2019s and Elliott Abrams\u2019s and Frank Gaffney\u2019s and so on.\n\nNone of this necessarily means that Bush would, say, drag the United States into a war with Iran. At the same time, let\u2019s be clear on a crucial point: Jeb didn\u2019t say he\u2019d have authorized the war in Iraq solely for the sake of his brother and peace at the Thanksgiving table. He said it also because it\u2019s where the Republican Party still is today. Most of the rest of the civilized world thinks the Iraq invasion was one of the great calamities of U.S. foreign policy history, if not the greatest. But to the neoconservative foreign policy establishment, and evidently still to the moneyed donor base too, it was still somehow the right thing to do.\n\nThat is, the people who\u2019ll be bankrolling his campaign and then filling his administration if he\u2019s elected are almost all going to be pro-preemptive war people. So it\u2019s not in comparison to his brother that we should worry whether he\u2019s his own man. It\u2019s in comparison to them.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:01.926+0000"}

Surprised?\n\nGranting political asylum to homeschoolers while making it harder for kids fleeing gang violence in Central America to find refuge in the United States is the latest in a wave of little noticed anti-immigrant proposals emerging from the Republican Congress. GOP lawmakers want to tighten laws that allow unaccompanied minors, often running away from violent and dangerous situations, to remain in the United States. But at the same time, they are seeking to protect a German homeschooling family with six children whose appeal for asylum was turned down by a federal appeals court judge who ruled that fleeing compulsory education in Germany did not qualify as credible persecution.\n\nA petition to grant the devoutly Christian Romeike family, who arrived in the United States in 2008, permanent legal status got 127,258 signatures on a White House \u201cWe the People\u201d petition, an online forum to persuade the Obama administration to take action. Last year the Department of Homeland Security declined to deport them, extending the family\u2019s \u201cdeferred action\u201d indefinitely, mirroring President Obama\u2019s executive orders on immigration that have so angered the GOP.\n\nThe family, with their now seven children (the last was born after they arrived), are happily settled in Morristown, Tennessee, but that victory was not sufficient for Utah Representative Jason Chaffetz, who sponsored the Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act, which seeks to define homeschoolers as a group eligible for federal protection. Under current law, asylum is granted to people persecuted because of their race, religion, or membership in a distinct group.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t recall any other three-month period where more aggressive anti-immigrant legislation has been introduced and debated,\u201d says Fitz.\n\n\u201cThis is a far-fetched, unprecedented claim to define a social group and an act of persecution,\u201d says Marshall Fitz, an immigration expert at the liberal Center for American Progress. \u201cIt\u2019s silly to try to bootstrap a prohibition on homeschooling into a recognized claim of persecution.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the Asylum Reform bill, which was approved this month by the House Judiciary Committee, tightens the \u201ccredible fear of persecution\u201d standard for asylum for other groups, bars the Obama administration from using taxpayer money to provide lawyers for the unaccompanied children from Central America, and makes it a criminal (instead of civil) violation to overstay a visa. If it became law, the bill would have the effect of \u201cgumming up the works,\u201d and leaving tens of thousands of children without any legal representation, a senior White House official told The Daily Beast.\n\nYet where is the outrage? Democrats appear resigned to the status quo of a Republican-controlled House passing legislation that pleases their base, but ultimately will go nowhere. \u201cA partisan, punitive approach may attract attention in some circles, but it\u2019s not a serious effort to legislate,\u201d says the White House official, adding that doesn\u2019t mean the GOP gets a pass. \u201cIf you were to watch Spanish language TV, they cover it extensively every day. Outrage is at a high boil.\u201d\n\nIt was December 2005, when Rep. James Sensenbrenner, then chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the GOP-controlled House, released his bill saying that anyone in the country illegally is a felon, and that those who help them could face criminal penalties. It triggered marches in the street in 2006. Hundreds of thousands of people protested in more than 100 cities angered by the bill\u2019s provision. \u201cIt would have made felons out of the entire population,\u201d says Fitz. The current bill has the same thrust, he says, referring to it as \u201cthe 2005 Sensenbrenner bill re-imagined.\u201d\n\nThe current bill has not gotten the attention of the earlier bill because no one believes it will make it to the president\u2019s desk or survive the veto it would certainly receive, he explains.\n\nA lot has happened in the decade since immigration reform activists took to the streets and the Republicans lost the House in 2006, then won it back in 2010 with Obama in the White House. Expectations for comprehensive immigration reform were raised, then dashed, and now they\u2019re on hold until the next election, no more than political fodder for both sides. \u201cI don\u2019t recall any other three-month period where more aggressive anti-immigrant legislation has been introduced and debated,\u201d says Fitz. There were six hearings in the House two weeks ago, and three in the Senate last week, on border security. \u201cNone of it is going anywhere,\u201d he says.\n\nThe depth of Republican fury over Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration is also holding up Loretta Lynch\u2019s confirmation as Attorney General, now not expected until mid-April, five months after she was nominated.\n\nThe likely effect is to cement the branding of Republicans as anti-immigration, which is not good for them going into a national election. Yet they can\u2019t seem to help themselves. Democrats say they\u2019re fine with protecting homeschoolers from Germany if Republicans would extend the same spirit of generosity to Central American kids whose lives are threatened. That won\u2019t happen for several reasons, including the complexity of asylum laws.\n\nThe homeschoolers the GOP wants to protect are Christians who want to shield their children from outside influences in public schools, and their claim to do so stems from the same ideological terrain that says people should have the right to turn down mandatory health insurance. It\u2019s a minor provision in a larger overhaul of asylum procedures, but the winners and losers are obvious, and they fall along partisan lines complicated by religion and race.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:02.181+0000"}

Trump arrives everywhere with the certainty and confidence of a guy who has never had to choose between making a mortgage payment or taking care of a tuition bill.\n\nHe is the most familiar face in a line-up of Republican candidates that with few exceptions resembles a parade of pygmies. He has been on TV for more than a decade so people figure they know him, the way they know the meteorologist, the sportscaster or the news anchor on their local network affiliate in Des Moines or Manchester.\n\nAnd when he shows up one of the big differences between Trump and the rest of the field is obvious. All the others arrive with a title and people ask questions that start with \u201cSenator\u201d or \u201cGovernor,\u201d but with Trump it\u2019s simply, \u201cHey, Donald.\u201d\n\nDonald is accessible. He isn\u2019t surrounded by a flying squadron of handlers and public relations hacks. He will answer any question posed to him and his replies are offered without fear of controversy because a big part of being Trump means you simply do not care what people think about what you just said.\n\nDonald is not boring. Half the rest of the Republican field, other than John Kasich, behave like store mannequins. The other half resemble people badly in need of professional help.\n\nThere is Cruz from Texas who could easily be cast as the villain in any Bond or Batman film. There is Rand Paul, clearly unaware that he is a dead man walking. There is Scott Walker, who, odds on, two years from now will be a greeter at the Oshkosh Home Depot. And there are just so many others on the massive GOP presidential stage who appear to be unable to do simple tasks like boiling water or plugging in a lamp without the risk of self-electrocution. Sad people.\n\nSo Donald\u2019s success isn\u2019t that much of a mystery. He says a lot of outrageous things along with some truly absurd things, but when you throw his nouns, verbs, adjectives, accusations, and attacks into the home blender you come up with a heaping glass full of the frustration cocktail Americans have been served over the past decade: wars that don\u2019t end, a Congress that doesn\u2019t work, paychecks that don\u2019t grow, take-home pay that never increases, bridges and roads that need to be rebuilt, public schools where the emphasis is on testing at the expense of thinking.\n\nDonald is scratching your sore. To him, the 1 percent that so many others talk about isn\u2019t the gamblers, greed-heads and tax-avoiding hedge fund billionaires who have turned a large part of the American economy into their very own casino. In other words, many of Trump\u2019s golfing pals.\n\nNo: the 1 percent Trump talks about endlessly is the 1 percent who sit in the House and the Senate; \u201cthe morons\u201d he claims that are incapable of getting anything done.\n\nIt is highly likely that Donald will not be the Republican nominee. And it is even more likely that Donald will never be seated around the table in the Situation Room, one hand on the trigger, the other on a comb, deciding whether or not to turn Tehran into dust, sand, and glass.\n\nBut standing in the back of a hall, listening to him speak while watching people nod their heads in some weird combination of agreement and amusement, one thing is pretty clear: Donald isn\u2019t going away for awhile.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:02.315+0000"}

The Clintons and the de Blasios could be seeing a lot of each other in the coming months.\n\nThat\u2019s because Clinton is on the cusp of another campaign for president, one in which she finds herself as the overwhelming favorite for the nomination but facing deep skepticism from some corners of the party who doubt her commitment to a progressive, populist agenda.\n\nThe leader of that charge, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, isn\u2019t likely to run herself but has historically been a decided Clinton skeptic, singling the former secretary of state out for criticism in one of her books and expressing surprise at Clinton\u2019s email scandal.\n\nDe Blasio, meanwhile, is not just running New York City but vying to become a major voice of the ascendant left himself. Could he become Clinton\u2019s go-to surrogate to progressives and liberal groups? Such a move could benefit them both, convincing Clinton\u2019s nervous left flank of her liberal bonafides while giving the mayor the platform he appears to crave.\n\n\u201cI do think it would be helpful,\u201d said Bertha Lewis, the head of the Black Institute and a longtime de Blasio ally. \u201cLook, he is the mayor of a city that is the center of the universe. I mean, New York City! Seriously! A progressive that won talking about income inequality and that fought the 1 percent who he dragged home kicking and screaming over the possibility of his mayoralty. He has a lot of cred with progressives. He was not supposed to win this. This is where the 1 percent live. So hell, yeah!\u201d\n\nAll New York City mayoralties are about something beyond just running a city. Rudy Giuliani became the national spokesman for new tough-on-crime measures. Mike Bloomberg toured the country promoting political independence.\n\nDe Blasio\u2019s New York is meant to stand as proof that government can address major progressive priorities and still function effectively, and he has not been bashful about making that point, traveling as far afield as Manchester, England, to address a Labour Party conference about the politics of income inequality.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not about who can whisper to the candidate and do the pillow talk. It\u2019s who is out there as the surrogate. The mayor is going to be on the record.\u201d\n\nThis month, de Blasio is scheduled to travel to Iowa and Nebraska to push the point. After the Democrats\u2019 midterm drubbing in November, he wrote a scathing op-ed in the Huffington Post in which he warned the Democratic Party against going wobbly: \u201cDon\u2019t Soul-Search. Stiffen Your Backbone,\u201d read the headline.\n\nBut despite all this, de Blasio still lacks Warren\u2019s punch. When progressive groups like Democracy for America or MoveOn.org send out mailers or hold rally-the-troops conference calls with their members, it is Warren who is featured, not de Blasio. There is no \u201cDraft de Blasio\u201d movement to speak of, though four out of the last six New York City mayors have at least flirted with running for president.\n\nLast month, de Blasio met with Clinton privately at her foundation headquarters, the news site Capital New York reported. His Brooklyn home is blocks away from her likely campaign headquarters, and even though no campaign surrogacy has been scheduled\u2014there is, after all, not yet a Clinton campaign\u2014Phil Walzak, his senior adviser, told The Daily Beast that \u201cMayor de Blasio intends to use his voice and the bully pulpit to encourage Democrats to embrace progressive values and a progressive vision. The mayor will also demonstrate that you can pursue a progressive agenda in a municipal setting and still have an effective, well-run city.\u201d\n\nPolitical strategists say Clinton needs someone who can energize the liberal base while she tries to position herself for a general election and avoid antagonizing the Wall Street types that fund presidential campaigns.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t be a fake-ass Republican. You just can\u2019t be. The game has changed,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cIt\u2019s not about who can whisper to the candidate and do the pillow talk. It\u2019s who is out there as the surrogate. The mayor is going to be on the record.\u201d\n\nAnd if there are any concerns that de Blasio fears tarnishing his political brand by championing a moderate, one need only recall the 2014 midterms, when de Blasio rushed to the full-throated defense of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo against a progressive challenger. Cuomo, like Clinton, is a longtime friend of the mayor\u2019s but also has seemingly taken great sport in toying with his party\u2019s progressive wing. No matter. De Blasio was even one of the first politicians to endorse Cuomo\u2019s choice for lieutenant governor, Kathy Hochul, a pro-gun, tough-on-immigrants former congresswoman, calling her \u201ca true progressive.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s and de Blasio\u2019s political careers have been practically intertwined since they both began in New York.

{"entityId": 1684, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "While Republicans are celebrating Planned Parenthood\u2019s PR disaster, Hillary Clinton and the other Democratic hopefuls are scrambling to respond.\n\nOver the last three weeks, Planned Parenthood has been the subject of three sting videos that purport to present company officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nThe videos, produced by the anti-abortion nonprofit and self-described \u201ccitizen journalist\u201d project Center for Medical Progress (CMP), have put Planned Parenthood on the defensive\u2014and the Democratic candidates for president, too. For Democrats, the push against Planned Parenthood is eerily reminiscent of a debate their party started to lose nearly 20 years ago, when abortion opponents used the politics of revulsion to sway public opinion on so-called partial-birth abortion.\n\nIn other words, the CMP videos have given pro-lifers plenty of gross-out pull quotes, leaving Democrats in the presidential race struggling to respond.\n\nThe first CMP video, released July 14, allegedly shows Planned Parenthood\u2019s senior director of medical services, Dr. Deborah Nucatola, explaining how abortion providers can conduct the procedure in a way that preserves the tissue. \u201cA lot of people want intact hearts these days,\u201d she says casually, as she picks at a salad, \u201cbecause they\u2019re looking for specific nodes.\u201d They want lungs, too, she goes on, and \u201calways as many intact livers as possible.\u201d\n\nIn the second video, Dr. Mary Gatter, a Planned Parenthood medical director, discusses the practice in uncomfortable detail. Although she comes across less callous than Nucatola, she at one point makes reference to the use of \u201cless crunchy\u201d abortion techniques.\n\nA third video, released Tuesday morning shows, what appears to be a Planned Parenthood physician sorting fetal tissue after an abortion.\n\nPlanned Parenthood has maintained repeatedly that the videos depict conversations about the long-standing practice of fetal tissue donation, which is legal under federal law provided that any payments received do not go into Planned Parenthood\u2019s coffers, but cover transportation, processing, and other logistical costs.\n\nBut by the time the videos were posted online, it was too late for damage control.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t responded to requests for clarification about her statement or questions about what, exactly, she found disturbing or why she hasn\u2019t seen the full videos.\n\nThe videos went immediately viral, and nearly every Republican presidential candidate was eager to capitalize on Planned Parenthood\u2019s PR catastrophe. Rand Paul, Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Mike Huckabee, and Scott Walker all called for the group\u2019s investigation or defunding, with Paul going so far as to vow to introduce legislation to defund it. (Federal law already dictates that any money allocated to Planned Parenthood cannot go toward abortion.)\n\nBut ask a Democratic candidate about the videos, and answers are less than forthcoming. In fact, it\u2019s not even clear if Hillary Clinton and her primary competitors have watched them.\n\nAsked by the New Hampshire Union Leader on Wednesday if she had seen the videos, Clinton responded, \u201cI have seen pictures from them and I obviously find them disturbing.\u201d She stopped short of calling for an investigation, however, saying only that if there were to be a congressional inquiry then \u201cit should look at everything and not just one part of it.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign hasn\u2019t responded to requests for clarification about her statement or questions about what, exactly, she found disturbing or why she hasn\u2019t seen the full videos.\n\nWhile campaigning in New Hampshire last Sunday, Martin O\u2019Malley told Fox, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the videos. And I don\u2019t generally make a habit of responding to right-wing videos.\u201d\n\nHe added that he would \u201cdefer to others for commenting on that video and whatever videos they\u2019re pumping out there.\u201d\n\nBernie Sanders referred to the videos as being part of a \u201csmear campaign\u201d this week, but his initial comments on the controversy two weeks ago came after he acknowledged to CNN that he had not watched the first video, only read press coverage of it. He said Planned Parenthood Federation of America President Cecile Richards was right to apologize for the \u201ctone\u201d of the videos.\n\nJim Webb and Lincoln Chafee haven\u2019t commented publicly on the videos at all, and their campaigns have yet to respond to requests for comment from The Daily Beast.\n\nWhen The Free Beacon asked the Sanders, O\u2019Malley, Webb, and Chafee campaigns if they would support investigating Planned Parenthood, the site was met with similar silence.\n\nConsidering the history of abortion politics, the reason for this silence seems almost obvious: Democrats fear another 1996.\n\nIn 1996, the pro-life community was preparing for what would have been its first major legislative success since the Supreme Court legalized abortion 23 years earlier. President Clinton had vetoed a ban on so-called partial-birth abortion\u2014referred to in the medical community as intact dilation and extraction (IDX), a controversial and now illegal procedure in which a fetus is removed intact by dilating a woman\u2019s cervix\u2014but the House had voted to override him, and Republicans expected the Senate would do the same.\n\nThe mood among pro-lifers was triumphant.\n\nConsidering the history of abortion politics, the reason for this silence seems almost obvious: Democrats fear another 1996.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge victory,\u201d Ralph Reed, then-director of the Christian Coalition, told The New York Times. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time since Roe v. Wade that Congress is poised to outlaw an abortion procedure and the first time the pro-choice side has had to defend the indefensible.\u201d\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate ultimately failed to override Clinton\u2019s veto, but the debate over \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortion had an immediate impact on American public opinion.\n\nAccording to Gallup historical data, support for legal abortion \u201cunder any circumstances\u201d steadily increased following Roe v. Wade, reaching an all-time high of 34 percent in 1992. At the same time, absolute opposition to abortion was on the decline, hitting a historical low of 13 percent in 1993.\n\nBut then \u201996 happened.\n\nAs Congress debated the \u201cpartial-birth\u201d abortion ban, public support for legal abortion under all circumstances tumbled back down to 25 percent and, over the next few years, unqualified opposition to abortion crept upward again.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t difficult to see why. A New York Times op-ed from September 1996 described the procedure in the most gruesome of terms: \u201c[A] doctor pulls out the baby\u2019s feet first, until the baby\u2019s head is lodged in the birth canal. Then, the doctor forces scissors through the base of the baby\u2019s skull, suctions out the brain, and crushes the skull to make extraction easier.\u201d\n\nOne of the major coups for pro-lifers in the CMP campaign is that they now appear to have video of officials like Nucatola describing fetal tissue donation using equally blunt language: \u201c[W]e\u2019ve been very good at getting heart, lung, liver, because we know that, so I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d\n\nBack in 1996, Bill Clinton ultimately won re-election despite jabs from the Robert Dole campaign over his veto on the \u201cpartial-birth\u201d ban, but the abortion debate would never be the same again. IDX procedures were eventually banned in 2003, with then-Senator Hillary Clinton voting against the ban. When running for Senate in 2000, Clinton said she would only support a ban \u201cso long as the health and life of the mother is protected,\u201d and the 2003 law, upheld by the Supreme Court in 2007, lacks a health exception.\n\nSupport for legal abortion under any circumstances has increased somewhat since 1996, but it has never quite reached that earlier 34 percent high.\n\nNow, armed with sound bites of Planned Parenthood doctors talking about \u201ccrunchy\u201d abortion techniques and video of fetal tissue being sorted, social conservatives, who have been defeated on the issue of gay marriage and marginalized in national political discourse, sense an opportunity to manufacture another 1996. To prevent a repeat, Planned Parenthood has been trying to distract from the videos with information about fetal tissue donation\u2014a task made more difficult by what appear to have been two cyberattacks on its website in the past week.\n\n\n\nBut history has shown that managing a heated public conversation on abortion is next to impossible. Before IDX procedures were made illegal, they were rare, accounting for about 0.2 percent of abortions performed in the year 2000, according to the Guttmacher Institute. But social conservatives latched onto the graphic details of the procedure until it became the epicenter of the abortion debate. Questions of its medical efficacy (many of the women who spoke to President Clinton ahead of his veto had the procedure because their lives were in danger) were largely obscured by detailed descriptions of suction and skull crushing.\n\nWith the sting videos\u2014and there are many more to come, although a restraining order issued Tuesday by a Los Angeles court could slow their release\u2014the Center for Medical Progress is making the same strategic move.\n\nThe organization has yet to produce hard evidence that Planned Parenthood has violated federal law, but that does not seem to be the group\u2019s primary aim. By describing the practice of fetal tissue donation in gross detail\u2014aided by some regrettable remarks from secretly taped Planned Parenthood officials\u2014pro-lifers are trying to force the pro-choice crowd into the same corner of silence that Democrats found themselves in during the \u201996 debate.\n\nAs The New York Times reported at the time: \u201cHouse members who oppose the ban say they have lost ground politically because the particulars of any abortion procedure is something no one who supports abortion rights really wants to talk about.\u201d\n\nToday\u2019s Democratic candidates face a similar predicament: Talk openly about the practice of fetal tissue donation and risk sounding \u201cghoulish\u201d by associating yourself with grisly medical imagery; refuse to address it and cede ground to abortion opponents who are determined to exploit this imagery to defund Planned Parenthood and pass stringent restrictions on abortion.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:02.799+0000"}

Clinton Presidential Center and Park.\n\nThe store sells all-things Clinton\u2014magnets, books, dolls, retro T-shirts from the 1992 campaign, sweatshirts that say \u201cI Miss Bill\u201d and hundreds of other Clinton-related items. Tourists usually flock to the store after visiting Bill Clinton\u2019s library and many arrive in Little Rock on flights that land at the Bill and Hillary National Airport.\n\nAlthough Bill and Hillary Clinton chose to live in New York after leaving the White House, the Clinton brand remains so strong in Arkansas that the state could be called Clintonland. In downtown Little Rock, Clinton Avenue leads to the Clinton presidential library, and a bust of Bill Clinton stands nears the gates of the Governor\u2019s Mansion. Hillary Clinton has a children\u2019s library named in her honor, and \u201cReady For Hillary\u201d stickers have been plastered on cars in the state for months.\n\nAnd after Hillary Clinton\u2019s announcement yesterday that she would be running for president, Clinton friends and city leaders say that another run could only be good for the state that the couple first called home.\n\n\u201cThe Clintons are like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps on going and going, and here we go again,\u201d said Skip Rutherford, dean of the University of Arkansas Clinton School of Public Service and a longtime friend of the Clintons. Perhaps better than anyone in Arkansas, he understands the impact the Clinton brand has had on the state. After all, he helped to create it.\n\nRutherford supervised the planning and construction of the Clinton Presidential Center and Park, a formerly abandoned warehouse site near the Arkansas River, and served as founding president of the William J. Clinton Foundation. Researchers from around the world visit Little Rock to comb through documents at the Clinton library. In fact, Rutherford said plenty of researchers are currently at the archives looking through documents related to Hillary Clinton. The Clinton School of Public Service is in its 10th year and students have performed nearly 700 field service projects around the world, he said.\n\nNear the library in downtown Little Rock, construction of everything from loft apartments to hotels and restaurants has not stopped since Bill Clinton announced his library in 1997. According to the Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, the library has generated more than $2 billion in investment locally and has had a total economic impact of $3.3 billion. In the 10 years since the center opened, more than 3 million visitors from around the world have visited, and travel expenditures in Pulaski County have increased by more than 68 percent, Gretchen Hall, president and CEO of the Little Rock Convention and Visitors Bureau, said.\n\n\u201cThe Clintons have had a tremendous impact on Arkansas, and especially Little Rock,\u201d said Hall. \u201cShould Secretary Clinton be elected as president, I feel certain that the Clintons\u2019 unique place in our state and country\u2019s history, as the first woman president and first couple to be individually elected as president, would continue to raise our city\u2019s profile and have a positive impact on our tourism industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Clintons are like the Energizer bunny, it just keeps on going and going, and here we go again.\u201d\n\nBut while the Clintons may be worshipped in many pockets of Arkansas, state Republicans aren\u2019t giving Hillary an ounce of love. On Sunday, just minutes after her announcement, Arkansas Republican Party Chairman Doyle Webb said in a statement that Hillary has been running for president for more than a decade and from scandal much longer.\n\n\u201cArkansas voters are all too familiar with the Clinton political style\u2014thinking laws and regulations about transparency and accountability don\u2019t apply to them,\u201d Webb said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see how Clinton will attempt to sidestep her conflicts of interest and hypocrisies on issues important to everyday Arkansans. Hillary Clinton may be able to delete her emails, but she can\u2019t delete her record.\u201d\n\nRutherford counters that Hillary Clinton\u2019s accomplishments in Arkansas when she was the state\u2019s first lady shouldn\u2019t be forgotten. For instance, he credits her for the neonatal clinic at Arkansas Children\u2019s Hospital that opened in the 1980s.\n\n\u201cWithout Hillary Clinton we wouldn\u2019t have that neonatal clinic, and think about how many lives have been saved because of her vision,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cShe was pregnant with Chelsea and she went to New York and secured funding for it.\u201d\n\nHe also points out that her work in Arkansas still pays dividends to children today. She brought the Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) program to the state for children to have education help at home. She also worked on improving education standards in Arkansas\u2019s schools.\n\n\u201cAll of her work then wasn\u2019t for a short-term effect,\u201d Rutherford said. \u201cThese things have to go through several generations to see an impact.\u201d\n\nBut for all the excitement\u2014or wariness\u2014in Arkansas at the thought of another Clinton campaign, the yellow-dog Democratic Arkansas that Hillary Clinton once knew is gone. Since her last run in 2008, the state has turned sharply to the right, with Republicans holding the governorship, both legislative chambers and all state offices. And while Bill and Hillary Clinton may retain a strong legacy in Arkansas, she may not win the state.\n\n\u201cI think it is fair to say Hillary Clinton is seen as much more of a national figure,\u201d said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College in Conway, Ark. \u201cAnd, in particular, she\u2019s a national Democratic figure with ties to the Obama administration. While personal ties once trumped party in Arkansas politics, it\u2019s safe to say that that is no longer the case and Arkansas is a very tough state for Democrats, even one with ties to the state. President Clinton invested time heavily in the state\u2019s elections in 2014 and the result was not what he hoped or anticipated.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:04.138+0000"}

It\u2019s the animal that gave us the cowboy\u2014symbol of the American spirit. And, of course, their meat and milk make up a prodigious portion of our diet.\n\nThe cow\u2019s outsized role is the subject of a new book, Cowed: The Hidden Impact of 93 Million Cows on America\u2019s Health, Economy, Politics, Culture, and Environment by Denis Hayes, the coordinator of the first Earth Day and a former Carter administration official, and his wife, Gail Boyer Hayes.\n\n\n\nThe books covers much of the ground tread in its acclaimed predecessors such as Christopher Leonard\u2019s The Meat Racket, Jonathan Safran Foer\u2019s Eating Animals, and Michael Pollan\u2019s The Omnivore\u2019s Dilemma, and his documentary, Food, Inc.\n\nThe Hayes\u2019s book talks about the horrors of the meat industry and what they mean for the planet (the production of methane, for instance), for humans (the industry pollutes by dumping bovine waste in water), for the economy (corn subsidies), and the cows themselves (when the stunning of a cow for slaughter \u201cis flubbed, the poor creature may be skinned and disassembled while still alive and conscious\u201d). The purpose of the book, the authors write, is to get people to eat less meat, as that\u2019s the only practical solution to the challenges raised.\n\n\n\nWhat is fascinating about the book is that it is emblematic of an environmental movement that has largely found itself stuck in the American political sphere.\n\nBut none of this is new to anybody who has come across this issue even tangentially.\n\nInstead, what is fascinating about the book is that it is emblematic of an environmental movement that has largely found itself stuck in the American political sphere. Half the electorate and two branches of government are unsympathetic if not outright hostile, and the party that it supports (Democrats) often takes it for granted.\n\n\n\nThings have gotten so bad that the most interesting issue talked about politically when it comes to environmentalists is what they can learn from the uber successful gay rights movement.\n\nAs the authors note throughout the book, they face opposition from conservatives on a lot of core issues. Yet when it comes to the nitty-gritty of political maneuvering, and how the environmental movement could make headway there, the authors seem to be living in an alternate reality. The 300-odd-page book is essentially a giant preaching to the choir.\n\nThere is, for instance, the part where the authors write, \u201cIf Congress ever places a price on carbon, as would be required by Senator Maria Cantwell\u2019s CLEAR Act, market forces would make cow power economical without voluntary subsidies.\u201d Even left-wing Think Progress labeled this idea \u201cneither politically nor environmentally viable.\u201d Or there\u2019s the part when they lament that Representative Louise Slaughter\u2019s proposed Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act \u201chas been endorsed by 368 worthy organizations but by none of her Republican colleagues.\u201d How is this shocking? Furthermore, how will a book catering only to people who care about those organizations move the dial?\n\nThe message is diluted by a lot of rants, akin to that well-meaning aunt or uncle who watched Current TV and just can\u2019t stay on the topic at hand. (Essentially the left\u2019s version of John Slattery\u2019s character on 30 Rock). It might get a lot of amens from the authors\u2019s friends, but it\u2019s unlikely to sway libertarians who might be sympathetic to their priorities on corn. Instead, the authors pop off about whether or not corporations are people. Or whether or not milk \u201cis an ideal transmitting agent for biological terrorism.\u201d Or debating the minutiae on raw milk, perennials, and till farming. None of these screeds really contribute to the end goal, which is convincing people to eat less meat.\n\nAlso, if we want something to appeal to the mainstream, how about we don\u2019t even bring up Malthus? \u201cAmmonium nitrate fertilizer revolutionized agriculture, winning a temporary respite in Malthus\u2019s race between human population growth and food limits,\u201d the Hayeses write. \u201cThe world\u2019s population today might be a third smaller but for the extra food made possible by this fertilizer.\u201d Paging the academy.\n\n\n\nThen there is the bizarre propaganda aspect of Cowed. Hedge-fund billionaire and Democratic mega-donor Tom Steyer and his wife, Kat Taylor, have an ode written to them in the book. The Hayes couple describes these underwriters of the environmental movement as \u201chardworking perfectionists who aren\u2019t easily intimidated\u201d and then ends the section with what can only be read as an advertisement for the billionaire\u2019s farm\u2019s product: \u201cLeftCoast GrassFed Beef is 100 percent grass-fed and grass-finished. The cows are given no hormones or antibiotics.\u201d And so on.\n\nAll of this is unfortunate, because the Hayes couple both have led praise-worthy careers and are fighting for a just cause\u2014to keep our planet healthy. But their book is just another reminder of how far the environmentalist movement has to go until their methods get the kind of traction necessary to foment actual action, and not just by the executive branch.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:04.595+0000"}

It won\u2019t be easy.\n\nA little over a decade ago, I met Bernie Sanders when I was a pimply-faced undergrad interning in his Washington office. I was attending college at a small liberal arts school in South Carolina, and I desperately needed a change of scenery, and his was the political voice I related to the most at the time.\n\nI needed to be around voices that ran counter to the toxic patriotic bravado that had consumed America in our post-9/11 world. Our gung-ho attitude was about to result in disastrous foreign policy decisions, and unprecedented infringements on civil liberties. Too many Muslim Americans were targets of unjust abuse as a fear of foreign \u201cbrown\u201d people consumed the country, and this hit home to me as an African American even if the abuse was not directed at me. When I flew to D.C. to start my internship in 2003, I was still stopped and taken aside for a more thorough security check at the airport. My complexion and my beard had made me a potential threat to the state. Our world was getting out of hand, and I wanted to work for a voice of reason, so to the surprise of many I decided to intern for a socialist from Vermont.\n\nI do not think my mother even knew who Sanders was at the time, and the few people who did found his disheveled hair to be more memorable than his political views. Sure, they knew that he was staunchly against the war in Iraq and championed civil liberties and civil rights, but they really wished that he would comb his hair more. Countless others I encountered were intrigued that a black male from the South would want to work for a white Yankee left-winger. They assumed I would have chosen to work for a black congressman and they wondered what we might have in common on issues both political and personal.\n\nOver the weekend this same scenario escaped the confines of my undergraduate world and took center court on the national stage as #BlackLivesMatter protesters disrupted Sanders and fellow Democratic presidential candidate Martin O\u2019Malley at the progressive Netroots Nation conference.\n\nBlack protesters chanted \u201cWhat side are you on, black people, what side are you on!\u201d while O\u2019Malley spoke. The protesters lobbed questions at both candidates regarding their civil rights records and they wanted to know if each of them would work to \u201cdismantle structural racism in this country.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley responded with an affirmative \u201cYes\u201d and later said, \u201cblack lives matter, white lives matter, all lives matter,\u201d to a chorus of boos.\n\nI do not think that my mother had even heard of Sanders until I told her that I would be working in his DC office.\n\nSanders, when it was his time to speak, took the stage saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want to out-scream you,\u201d and he then proceeded with his previously planned speech as the protesters continued to interrupt him. He bristled with discomfort at questions about his civil rights record and eventually he addressed the protesters, saying, \u201cBlack people are dying in this country because we have a criminal justice system that is out of control.\u201d\n\nAs moderator Jose Antonio Vargas was unable to control the crowd, Sanders asked him, \u201cWhat are we doing here?\u201d\n\nThese protests surprised many at the conference, and Sanders\u2019s befuddlement, shock, and frustration reminded me of the bizarre responses I received from others when I first decided to intern for him. There was a disconnect and an assumed incompatibility between the black community and Sanders despite the fact that both have similar positions on most issues.\n\nThis disconnect can lead people to question the civil rights record of someone with a 100 percent voting record, according to the NAACP\u2019s congressional report card.\n\nDuring the 1960s Sanders participated in sit-ins fighting racial segregation, so he has been fighting against racial injustices for longer than many of the people who protested him have even been alive. Yet still over the weekend, #BernieSoBlack was trending on Twitter and mocking his activism.\n\nThis is the dichotomy Sanders faces. He has a long track record of fighting for civil rights, but he primarily has only needed to express these facts to white audiences. His messaging does not appeal to black voters, and most\u2014like my mother\u2014have no idea who he is or what he has done until someone else tells them about him.\n\nVermont is this bizarre state that cares about the issues that are important to African Americans while also being nearly devoid of black people. The state is roughly 95 percent white. Of Vermont\u2019s nearly 630,000 inhabitants, only 1.2 percent are black.\n\nThis is a difficult situation to explain. How can a senator care about black people without having nearly any black people in his state? Electorally, he has never been accountable to black voices.\n\nIf Sanders wants to sustain his momentum and have a fighting chance of becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, he must show that he not only relates to African Americans on the issues that matter most to them, but also that he can relate to them on a personal level.\n\nHillary Clinton has already displayed her ability to win over black voters in her successful Senate campaigns, and no one can doubt Bill Clinton\u2019s appeal to African-American voters. Many black families still talk about his fabled appearance on The Arsenio Hall Show playing the saxophone.\n\nSanders has thus far surprised many with his packed auditoriums full of supporters and his competitive polling against Clinton in Iowa and New Hampshire, but if he wants to be considered a serious challenger, he needs to be competitive in South Carolina. Success in South Carolina requires winning over black voters.\n\nThere is time for Sanders to do this, and the current Democratic front-runner has already shown that her support among African Americans is not as steady as one would think. The rapper Killer Mike, who has been a significant voice in the #BlackLivesMatter movement, has recently endorsed Sanders, so this is a step in the right direction.\n\nThe chaos at Netroots Nation this weekend made it clear as day that Sanders has a mountain to climb to win over black voters.

{"entityId": 1689, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Did Cruz really sign up for Obamacare hoping the Supreme Court would nix the subsidies, giving him a ready-made horror story? Yeah, probably.\n\nThere are just so many interesting questions about Ted Cruz, are there not? Okay, maybe not that many. But the one of keenest interest by far to me is: Does he really think he can get away with manufacturing a fake personal Obamacare horror story and peddle it in Dogpatch and get votes with it?\n\nHere\u2019s the situation. Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi, recently took a leave of absence from her big Wall Street job at Goldman Sachs. The Cruz family was on her health plan. Cruz announced with fanfare and to much amusement about two weeks ago that he and the family would be going on Obamacare, over which he singlehandedly shut down the federal government and whose every word he has vowed 18,674 times to repeal.\n\nThere has been lots of speculation about why. Bloomberg\u2019s Dave Weigel wrote on March 24 that Cruz, in saying he was choosing Obamacare because he wanted to \u201cfollow the text of the law,\u201d was \u201ccontrasting his sacrifice with the law-dodging ruthlessness of the Obama administration.\u201d Then last week Brian Beutler upped the ante, laying out the following a new theory in The New Republic.\n\nCruz, he wrote, wants to go on Obamacare in the hope that the Supreme Court, in the King v. Burwell case, rules against the federal subsidies. Such a decision would end the subsidies in states that did not set up their own health-care exchanges. Texas, where Cruz is officially domiciled, is one of those states. If the subsidies are struck down, premiums in states like Texas are expected to shoot up. That means Ted Cruz\u2019s premiums will shoot up. Thus, he\u2019ll have a personal Obamacare nightmare to retail on the stump. Pure gold.\n\nLest you think I\u2019m being conspiratorial, and this is too devious and twisted even for the mind of Ted Cruz, hear me out on this point: There would appear to be no reason that Cruz had to choose Obamacare. The Cruz family in all likleihood had two other options. First, they could presumably have continued his wife\u2019s Goldman Sachs coverage through COBRA, the law that allows ex-employees of a workplace to keep that workplace health coverage for 18 months provided they pay for all of it.\n\nA second option would have been to purchase health coverage on the individual market but outside the exchanges. That is, outside of Washington, D.C., and Vermont, where the law was set up such that everything runs through the exchanges, a person can buy regular-old, non-Obamacare insurance by just going to insurance companies\u2019 websites and toll-free lines, or by going through an insurance broker.\n\nThere could be reasons not to do COBRA. The ex-employee has to pay the whole cost of the premiums, as opposed to just the employee\u2019s share (for most people, around a quarter of the cost). So COBRA isn\u2019t cheap. But the Cruzes aren\u2019t exactly poor, and besides there are very good reasons to take COBRA (you get to keep the plan you\u2019ve been on and are familiar with, stay in the same physician network).\n\nBut the weirder mystery is why he didn\u2019t just buy coverage not through the exchange. It sure seems to me that buying non-Obamacare coverage would be kind of the obvious thing to do for one who so detests Obamacare. I put these two specific questions, about COBRA and non-exchange coverage, to Cruz\u2019s campaign press person last week but got no reply.\n\nNow, ir Cruz ever does have to answer specific questions about COBRA or non-ACA coverage, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll just hop up on Rocinante and thunder rhetoric to the effect that if my people must suffer, But it\u2019s nonsense. First of all, his people don\u2019t have to suffer; as I noted, anyone in the great state of Texas who wants to buy non-Obamacare coverage is free to do so. The reason to get coverage through Obamacare, and the reason that something close to 900,000 Texans have enrolled in Obamacare, is to get the subsidies. The subsidies can only be had through Obamacare. But the Cruzes, even on only his Senate salary, make too much money for subsidies. So there was no point in him taking Obamacare.\n\n\n\nThere would appear to be no reason that Cruz had to choose Obamacare. The Cruz family in all likleihood had two other options.\n\nThus it seems obvious to me: He chose Obamacare hoping that the Supremes strike the subsidies down, after which Texas premiums\u2014and more to the point, his own\u2014skyrocket, and he gets to go out on the campaign trail and go into hysterics about the enormous personal damage Obamacare has done to him, his dear wife, and his two beautiful little girls. I mean, you can just hear him now, can\u2019t you, ladling on the sauce, tear forming in the corner of his eye? They\u2019ll eat it up in Iowa like double-bacon corn dogs at the state fair.\n\nOr will they? Are people that stupid? Probably, when the assertion is something they want to believe anyway (Obamacare is evil). But surely some of his opponents will call him out. Jeb Bush: \u201cPeople of Iowa, stop and think! He had other options and chose Obamacare in the very hope that his premiums would go up! He\u2019s playing you for rubes!\u201d That could work. But as a rule, people don\u2019t generally appreciate being told they\u2019re rubes. Especially by a man (Jeb) they pretty clearly don\u2019t like.\n\nThe media might start snooping around these matters a little more if Cruz actually starts doing that on the stump. Right now, this scenario is just the conjecture (albeit the informed conjecture) of liberal journalists. But if it comes to pass, the Cruzes will have a lot more explaining to do about COBRA and non-Obamacare coverage.\n\nAnd finally, the Supreme Court could foil everything by upholding the subsidies in its upcoming King decision. Then he\u2019ll be stuck with the worst of both worlds: enrolled in Obamacare with no sob story to tell about it. He\u2019ll invent some woe, of course. He\u2019ll have to. He can\u2019t leave America with the impression that the Cruz family is happy with its Obamacare coverage, even\u2014especially\u2014if it happens to be true.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:04.900+0000"}

And Washington is demanding answers.\n\nThe U.S. had practically round-the-clock surveillance of the site where American hostage Warren Weinstein was held by al Qaeda in Pakistan. Yet a CIA drone strike still accidentally killed him and a fellow captive, Italian Giovanni Lo Porto. And that\u2019s again raising questions about the accuracy of drone strikes and the danger they pose to innocent civilians.\n\nA U.S. official who had been briefed on the January 14 strike told The Daily Beast that it was targeting a meeting of mid-level al Qaeda leaders at what was believed to be a compound consisting of several buildings. As the suspected jihadists pulled up, U.S. drones hit them. The U.S. official said that those conducting the strike were not sure who everyone attending the purported meeting was.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters Thursday that U.S. intelligence officials \u201chad no idea [Weinstein] was there.\u201d\n\nAnother U.S. official told The Daily Beast that the government is now conducting a \u201cthorough, independent review\u201d into whether it needs to refine its assessments of the risks to hostages in future strikes. Earnest also said there is \u201can ongoing [CIA] inspector general review of this matter.\u201d A spokesman for the CIA declined to comment.\n\nObama administration officials sought to portray the hostages\u2019 deaths as an unavoidable mistake in what President Obama called, in a brief televised statement, \u201cthe fog of war.\u201d Earnest said intelligence officials had determined \u201cwith near certainty\u201d that the site was used by members of al Qaeda but not that any hostages were held at the facility.\n\nLawmakers are now asking questions about the drone attack and how it was that the CIA never knew civilians were in danger. \u201cI have asked the agency to come in to give me a deep dive on the operation and suspect that other members will want the same,\u201d Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told The Daily Beast. Schiff said he\u2019d not yet discussed with the committee chairman, Devin Nunes, whether to hold a formal investigation or hearings, \u201cbut I would recommend a thorough review.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. And you\u2019re not going to stop tragedies like this from happening as long as you\u2019re in a war.\u201d\n\nCongressional overseers of the intelligence community had been previously briefed about the operation. Maryland Senator Ben Cardin, who represents Weinstein\u2019s home state, told The Daily Beast he had received a call from CIA Director John Brennan on Wednesday. Cardin also said he had personally called Weinstein\u2019s wife to offer his condolences.\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has already reviewed the operation twice, Chairman Richard Burr told The Daily Beast. He hinted that the panel looked into the matter a second time after it was realized that civilians had died in the operation. Burr didn\u2019t say when that second examination began.\n\n\u201cIf for some reason there are unintended consequences of anything that might come out of intelligence operations, we routinely take a second look at it. As it relates to this, we already have and we will continue to look into details,\u201d Burr said. \u201cThe fact that there were individuals that were killed that we didn\u2019t originally anticipate would have been affected automatically triggers a re-look.\u201d\n\nBut some lawmakers remained hawkish on the drone program, which has been a key pillar in the Obama administration\u2019s counterterrorism operations.\n\nPhoto Illustration by Dair Massey/The Daily Beast\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. It\u2019s called war. And you\u2019re not going to stop tragedies like this from happening as long as you\u2019re in a war,\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham. \u201cThis is part of war. You can\u2019t have a war without collateral damage.\u201d\n\nGraham said he doesn\u2019t hold the president responsible for the accidental killing of hostages. \u201cThe families blame al Qaeda, and they should. We made a mistake. I\u2019ve been a big critic of Obama\u2014I\u2019m not going to blame him for this. I blame al Qaeda\u2026 We\u2019re not going to terminate this drone program. I\u2019m sorry these two innocent civilians were killed, I\u2019m glad the two Americans collaborating with the enemy were. Please understand we\u2019re at war. It\u2019s a nasty, terrible business\u2014but I\u2019m in it to win it.\u201d\n\nThe CIA, for its part, was tracking someone whom it thought was an important, senior al Qaeda member at that compound, officials said. Precisely who he was, the CIA says it didn\u2019t know.\n\nThree months after the drone strike, they may have gotten a very public clue. On April 12, al Qaeda confirmed in a tweet that a drone strike had killed an American, Ahmed Farouq, who\u2019d become a senior member of al Qaeda. Though not among the most-well known terrorists, as deputy emir of al Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent, Farouq had a major role in the planning of a September 2014 attack in which militants infiltrated Pakistan\u2019s navy and tried to hijack one of its ships.\n\nThe strike that al Qaeda said killed Farouq was thought to be the same strike that killed the hostages.\n\nThe American-turned-al Qaeda terrorist had been in the CIA\u2019s crosshairs just weeks before the strike on the compound. He was reportedly targeted in an earlier U.S. drone strike, in December 2014, and there were conflicting accounts about whether he\u2019d been killed.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the CIA was intensely watching the compound where Weinstein and Lo Porto were being held. Earnest said the U.S. had hundreds of hours of surveillance on the site, and in the time before the strike, \u201cnearly continuous\u201d surveillance. Whomever the CIA was looking for, he was important enough to watch without blinking.\n\nOrdinarily, Obama reviews and signs off on any strikes that target Americans, but in this case, the CIA didn\u2019t know Farouq was there, so the president didn\u2019t review the mission, officials said. The Wall Street Journal reported that the CIA observed someone they believed was a senior Al Qaeda member entering the compound, but that they didn\u2019t know it was Farouq.\n\nYet officials say that in the initial battlefield assessment conducted after the strikes, there was no evidence that either civilians or top al Qaeda leaders had been killed. Rather, questions only emerged in the last few weeks, the U.S. official said. And by this month, \u201cthere was a high level of confidence that civilians had been killed\u201d as well, the U.S. official said.\n\nEarnest said that in the weeks that followed the strike, some as yet undescribed intelligence indicated that Weinstein may have been killed. U.S. analysts followed leads and pored over hundreds of hours of surveillance video. Only in the past few days did they determine with a degree of \u201chigh confidence\u201d that Weinstein had been killed in the operation, Earnest said. Obama spoke to Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Wednesday to tell him that Lo Porto also had been killed. The conversation was \u201crelatively short and very direct,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThe CIA is supposed to follow a rigorous process meant to test the quality of the intelligence used in drones strikes and to ensure that civilians aren\u2019t killed in those operations. \u201cThey\u2019re looking for intelligence that would wave them off,\u201d Earnest said. Assessments about a particular targeted go through \u201ca thorough red team process\u201d to review the intelligence before any strike is conducted and \u201cto try to poke holes in it, to make sure it represents the complete picture,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nBut if the CIA drone operators\u2019 experience is anything like that of their military counterparts, there are frequently concerns about collateral damage.\n\n\u201cIf we see something that we think might have been a problem\u2026we\u2019ll report those. We report a lot of them, actually,\u201d said Colonel Jim Cluff, commander of the 432nd Air Expeditionary Wing, which runs drone operations at Creech Air Force Base in Nevada. Cluff added that he wasn\u2019t aware of any investigation going on now.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s any doubt in anyone\u2019s mind, and it happens all the time, we want to make sure,\u201d Cluff told The Daily Beast, adding that the Air Force watches a target from a variety of angles to determine whether there\u2019s any risk of collateral damage. \u201cThere\u2019s probably three or four video sources watching an event\u2026We have that ability [to say], \u2018Hey, let\u2019s hold off a second.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the case of the strike that killed Weinstein and Lo Porto, administration officials said there was no indication that civilians were in the compound. Earnest described that as illustrative of al Qaeda\u2019s willingness to keep its hostages, whom it considers particularly valuable as negotiating chips, away from the eyes of U.S. intelligence agencies.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether the U.S. intelligence showed that Weinstein and Lo Porto may have been held in the geographic area where the strike occurred, if not in the compound itself. Had they known, history suggests the CIA might have held off on the drone strike.\n\nA Taliban source told The Daily Beast that when Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl was being held by the Haqqani Network, a Taliban affiliate, \u201cmany times we were not attacked by drone, and the reason was the U.S. [did] not want to kill Bergdahl.\u201d\n\nIf the U.S. had reason to believe Weinstein might be nearby, the military could have theoretically planned a rescue mission. But Earnest said that could have posed a risk to U.S. forces and that there was no guarantee Weinstein would be found alive.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t order up a special operations raid every time we suspect a terrorist might be somewhere,\u201d Earnest said.\n\n\u201cIn this case, we had abundant surveillance of this compound,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThe intelligence that there were al Qaeda figures operating in this compound proved to be correct. The intelligence that there was no one else in the compound proved to be fatally wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Sami Yousafzai, Jacob Siegel, Noah Shachtman, Jamie Dettmer, and Barbie Latza Nadeau", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:05.068+0000"}

The reality is quite different, however. Apart from wanting to trim food stamps, foreign aid, and Medicaid, Republicans simply aren\u2019t willing to specify the programs they are truly willing to ax\u2014especially the Republicans now out on the campaign trail.\n\nExhibit A is defense spending. Republicans love it. In fact, they love it so much that they can\u2019t get enough of it. Ever. For all their complaints about government inefficiency, many of them seem to think that it doesn\u2019t apply to the Department of Defense, and that every additional dollar spent on projects like the F35\u2014a supposedly nuclear-capable fighter jet that defense contractor Lockheed Martin has been working on since 2001 and is long overdue and over budget and still not fully operational\u2014or the super-expensive and unnecessary Abrams Tank translates into increased national security.\n\nThe opening battle in Congress over the fiscal 2016 budget is illustrative. Ever since Congress and the Obama administration capped the defense budget under the 2011 Budget Control Act\u2014the so-called \u201csequester\u201d agreement that allowed the debt ceiling to increase\u2014Republican military hawks and their conservative backers have been chomping at the bit to undo the so-called \u201cdamage.\u201d It was actually quite funny\u2014for a while\u2014to watch Republicans become full-blown Keynesians, arguing that defense cuts would destroy the economy and threaten jobs.\n\nNow that Republicans have complete control of Congress, the hawks have seized upon the party leadership\u2019s strong desire to pass a unified budget resolution as an opportunity to lard up Uncle Sam\u2019s war machine. While a budget resolution doesn\u2019t have the force of law, it does create the framework for the actual allocation of taxpayer dollars to the federal government\u2019s various parts that will come later.\n\nFor the hawks, that means getting the largest number for the Pentagon as possible\u2014the methodology be damned. And with the House and the Senate having passed their versions and working on a conference agreement, it looks like the hawks will have succeeded in getting that larger number via the Pentagon\u2019s slush fund: It\u2019s called the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, and the thing that they love about the OCO account is that it is not subject to the budget caps.\n\nInstead of just busting the defense cap and finally dropping any pretense that they were ever serious about tackling the Pentagon\u2019s bloat, the GOP decided to make a mockery of it.\n\nIf you are thinking that the OCO account was originally set up to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, you would be right. If you are thinking that this is all that it does, though, you would be wrong. It has long been used by both parties as a convenient way to spend money on stuff that otherwise wouldn\u2019t fit under the Pentagon\u2019s base budget, which is subject to the caps. And because it\u2019s supposed to be an \u201cemergency\u201d war budget, the oversight is light. Thus it\u2019s an ideal vehicle for wasteful spending.\n\nHow much money does the GOP want to shove into the OCO slush fund? Both the House and Senate budget resolutions would add $38 billion to the president\u2019s $58 billion OCO request for a total of $96 billion. That $96 billion would be on top of base national defense funding of $523 billion, which is the maximum allowable under the caps, for a total of $619 billion.\n\nI understand that this move is an attempt to appease both sides of the Republican Party, the defense hawks and the debt hawks. But it remains infuriating. Instead of just busting the defense cap and finally dropping any pretense that they were ever serious about tackling the Pentagon\u2019s bloat, the GOP decided to make a mockery of it.\n\nAt least the president openly requested to blow the budget caps. Under the administration\u2019s proposed budget, base national defense would be $554 billion, plus $58 billion in OCO funds, for a total of $612 billion. The $612 billion the president wants for defense isn\u2019t much less than the GOP\u2019s $619 billion. But the difference is that the GOP\u2019s methodology for arriving at its figure it a complete joke.\n\n\n\nOf course, the president\u2019s generous proposal for defense funding comes at a price: He also wants to obliterate the cap for domestic spending by $35 billion. With that in mind, ask yourself what you think will ultimately happen when the Republican Congress has to strike a deal with the White House to actually fund the government for fiscal 2016? Okay, I\u2019ll tell you.\n\nThe president has already declared his intention that he is willing to spend more on defense in order to spend more on non-defense. And the final budget resolution is going to load up on defense spending one way or another. So it doesn\u2019t take a strong imagination to envision that when the dust finally settles later this year, the GOP Congress will likely end up caving in to the Democrats\u2019s desire for more spending on domestic programs in exchange for more spending on defense.\n\nSo for all the talk about smaller government and fiscal responsibility, it appears that once again congressional Republicans are more interested in showering the Pentagon with taxpayer dollars while refusing to ever resist the lure of war. They\u2019re the cocaine laboratory monkeys of useless defense spending, and they just can\u2019t stop self-administering. And once again conservatives are about to find out that you\u2019ll never get smaller government at home if you insist on big government abroad.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:05.258+0000"}

These days being the Party of the South doesn\u2019t get you very far. George H.W. Bush, in 1988, was the last Republican to win both a first presidential term and the popular vote. In 2012, President Obama was reelected after winning only 39 percent of the white vote, the largest deficit of white votes of any successful Democratic candidate.\n\nAnd in case anyone has been watching, Virginia, the Seat of the Confederacy and General Lee\u2019s home, twice voted for Barack Obama, and sends two Democrats to the U.S. Senate.

Only in America.\n\nBut Graham then let the cat out of the bag when he said, \u201cto others, it\u2019s a racist symbol, and it\u2019s been used by people in a racist way.\u201d Like in the year 2015 A.D.

It represents the homosexual agenda, open borders and Third World immigration, a culture that is an open sewer, perpetual war for perpetual profit, among many other enormities.\n\nAnd despite all this, the Republican field won\u2019t confront the issue head-on. Sen. Marco Rubio was mealy mouthed when it came to the Confederate flag:\n\nWhat I do think is important to remember is that the people of South Carolina have dealt with this issue before. They have found a bipartisan consensus over a decade ago on moving that flag to a new location. And I have confidence in their ability to deal with that issue again. So I think it\u2019s important to let the people of South Carolina move forward on it.\n\n\u201cMove forward\u201d? If you think of punting the football on fourth down as moving forward then yes, Rubio is in favor of moving forward.\n\nAs for Ted Cruz, he was uncharacteristically muted, at least he tried to be, calling the flag \u201ca question for South Carolina,\u201d adding that \u201cthe last thing they need is people from outside of the state coming in and dictating how they should resolve it.\u201d\n\nBut then Cruz couldn\u2019t resist, \u201cBut I also understand those who want to remember the sacrifices of their ancestors and the traditions of their states\u2014not the racial oppression, but the historical traditions.\u201d\n\nWhat other traditions is Texas\u2019s junior senator thinking about? Plantation life, the Corner Stone Speech of Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, Strom Thurmond\u2019s 1948 presidential bid as a Dixiecrat, or Cruz\u2019s own dad siding back with Fidel Castro in the Old Country, until he came to the U.S. seeking asylum? Yeah, traditions.\n\nAs for Rand Paul, M.D., he framed the shootings in clinical terms, \u201cWhat kind of person goes in a church and shoots nine people? \u2026There\u2019s a sickness in our country; there\u2019s something terribly wrong.\u201d Thank you Dr. Paul.\n\nThis is the same Dr. Paul whose former aide, Jack Hunter, made headlines when it came to light that he was once known as the \u201cSouthern Avenger,\u201d a radio shock jock who had made provocative comments about the Civil War and race.\n\nRather than dither and deflect, the GOP should take a page out of Bill Clinton\u2019s playbook, engage in some political jujitsu of their own, and make the Confederate flag their own Sister Souljah moment. Clinton had the courage to say that race-baiting from the African-American community had no place within the Democratic Party.\n\nRepublicans should do the same and denounce the Confederate flag. The Civil War should have been over by now.\n\nAnd one more thing, this coming July 4th, all presidential wannabees should visit the Civil War battlefields at Gettysburg and Vicksburg, hallowed grounds, where Americans fought and died fighting each other. History still has lessons to be taught and learned.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:05.660+0000"}

{"entityId": 1695, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Scott Walker has been remarkably successful in politics, winning all but two of the races he\u2019s run. But the victors of the two contests are more than willing to dish about how they beat Wisconsin\u2019s union slayer many years ago.\n\nScott Walker has been running for office in some way, shape, or form, since 1988. And for the most part, he\u2019s been a winner.\n\nWalker has only lost two races in his more than 25 years in politics\u2014not counting the bid he dropped to be the Wisconsin Republican gubernatorial nominee in 2006.\n\nSo who beat the future union slayer? Representative Gwen Moore in 1990, and then-fellow Marquette student Jack Quigley in 1988. Moore and Quigley are in a tiny, elite club that Walker\u2019s 15 fellow Republican presidential candidates (is it still just 15?) would love to join as well.\n\nSo far, Walker has had a relatively charmed campaign for the Republican nomination.\n\nHis poll numbers have been steady and consistently high. Unlike Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio\u2014not to mention the lower-tier candidates that have little name recognition to begin with\u2014he doesn\u2019t seem to have taken a giant hit from the Donald Trump Media Vortex.\n\nAnd unlike certain other Republican candidates, he\u2019s actually gotten a lot of things done that make conservative hearts swell with devotion.\n\nHe\u2019s rewarded with the first place spot in a new NBC/Marist poll of potential Iowa Republican caucusgoers, although he now leads his nearest rival, Trump, by just two points, within the margin of error. In New Hampshire, according to the NBC/Marist poll, Walker is in a virtual dead heat with Jeb Bush for second place behind Trump.\n\n\u201cI think if you can use the Bible against him, that\u2019s probably helpful.\u201d \u2014Jack Quigley\n\nMoore and Quigley urge Walker\u2019s rivals to play the long game. They have plenty of advice\u2014and plenty of warnings\u2014for people looking to beat the two-term governor.\n\nQuigley\u2019s advice is literally Biblical.\n\n\u201cI think if you can use the Bible against him, that\u2019s probably helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I were running against Scott right now, I\u2019d probably be pulling out some Biblical passages, just for the heck of it.\u201d\n\nHe faced Walker in the rancorous 1988 contest to be president of the Marquette University student government\u2014a contest that, Politifact reported, resulted in charges of campaign rule violations by both sides, and produced a record turnout.\n\nOne issue Quigley said he pushed throughout the campaign was for the university to divest from Apartheid South Africa. A central part of his platform was putting a Marquette student on the university\u2019s board of trustees to push for those divestment efforts.\n\nWalker, according to Quigley, avoided the topic in general, and only addressed it to say he favored then-President Ronald Reagan\u2019s policy of constructive engagement with the Apartheid government. So Quigley tried to push him on it by invoking Scripture.\n\n\u201cIt was a difficult place for him to be, because what do you say to the Catholic kid from Chicago who\u2019s now using the Bible to talk about why we need to divest from South Africa?\u201d Quigley said. \u201cThat made him more uncomfortable, which is why I continued to do it.\u201d\n\nQuigley said Walker was least formidable when the two squared off at public forums and events. Instead of trying to engage fellow students and relate to their concerns, he tended to go from one talking point to another when asked about campus issues. When a student asked why their activity fees were so high, for instance, he talked about budgetary analysis instead of bringing up his middle-class, non-wealthy background.\n\nQuigley also said the future governor relied heavily on notes during that first campaign\u2014a habit he seems to have kicked completely, as he gave his presidential announcement speech this month without a teleprompter or cue cards.\n\nBesides Apartheid, abortion politics also came into the race.\n\nIn the November before the campaign started, two pro-choice nuns came to campus for a speaker series. Their presentation at the Catholic institution was extremely controversial, and pro-life students picketed the event.\n\nQuigley crossed the picket line to attend the speech, and said some of Walker\u2019s supporters used his attendance to suggest he would surreptitiously push a pro-abortion agenda on campus if elected.\n\nWalker didn\u2019t push that message, Quigley said. But he also didn\u2019t repudiate it.\n\n\u201cWhen confronted a few times, he denied that he did it,\u201d Quigley said, discussing the genesis of those attacks, \u201cbut said things like, \u2018These are important issues, I assume if people are concerned about it they deserve to have an answer.\u2019\u201d\n\nOver the course of the campaign, which took about two months, Quigley came to loathe Walker.\n\n\u201cI started to intensely dislike him, and it made me an awful lot more driven in the race,\u201d he said.\n\nWalker\u2019s fans use the term \u201cWalker Derangement Syndrome\u201d to refer to the now-governor\u2019s unique ability to gin up enormous (and sometimes theatrical and over-the-top) emotional responses from his ideological opponents. While the governor\u2019s stump-speech skills seem to have improved dramatically, his ability to draw ire isn\u2019t new.\n\nTwo years after losing to Quigley, Walker challenged Moore for her state Assembly seat. She said she first heard about the 22-year-old\u2019s bid from a Republican who worked in the Assembly with her.\n\n\u201cI thought it was hysterical,\u201d she said.\n\nMoore said she had a child at 18 and came from a poor background, so she had to put a lot of effort into graduating from college.\n\n\u201cSo the fact that he had dropped out of college and was running against me was something that was perplexing,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite the fact that hers was a very safe Democratic seat, Moore, who is African-American, said a Republican friend told her Walker thought he could be competitive because most of the voters in the district were white.\n\n\u201cWalker knew what I knew, that the voters were white,\u201d she said. \u201cThat became kind of his strategy for electioneering, from that point until this point.\u201d\n\nMoore said that Walker distributed campaign literature with racial dog whistles and pictures of guns. The implication, she felt, was that Moore wouldn\u2019t fight urban decay, crime, and violence because she was black.\n\n\u201cI remember being so upset about it that I was brought to tears,\u201d she said.\n\nMoore was the first person of color to represent her majority-white district. One night, frantic about the election, she stayed out past 8 p.m. in the pouring rain canvassing one of its whitest neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cPeople said, \u2018Gwen, we will not vote for you if you don\u2019t stop acting like a crazy person. It\u2019s pouring down rain! Go home!\u2019\u201d she remembered, laughing.\n\nShe went on to beat Walker handily. Two years later, he won an Assembly seat in a different district, and the two went back to squaring off. In the legislature, one of his first efforts was to pass voter ID legislation.\n\n\u201c\u2018Well, if you need a photo ID to get a video from Blockbuster, then you ought to have to have a photo ID to vote,\u2019\u201d she recalled him arguing. \u201cAnd I responded and said, \u2018Well, you know, getting a video from Blockbuster is not a constitutional right. Voting is.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut they didn\u2019t disagree on everything. Representative Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat who served on the Assembly\u2019s corrections committee with Moore and Walker, said the three worked together on an effort to keep juveniles from being put in the supermax prison that held the state\u2019s most dangerous offenders.\n\nBut Moore said that for the most part, Walker took a tough-on-crime approach.\n\n\u201cIt was all about trail \u2019em, nail \u2019em and jail \u2019em,\u201d she said.\n\nAnd, she added, it fit into a racialized pattern of lawmaking.\n\n\u201cI always thought, in the issues he focused on, that there was this racial thread that ran all the way through it,\u201d she said.\n\nHer advice to people trying to beat him in the 2016 contest?\n\n\u201cWatch your back,\u201d she said. \u201cHe will flip-flop and he will stab you in the back, and he will not tell the truth.\u201d\n\nAnd although neither might be fond of Walker on a personal level, Quigley and Moore both said Walker\u2019s doggedness is impressive.\n\n\u201cHe deserves credit for sticking to his goals,\u201d Quigley said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t give up easily.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:06.753+0000"}

Biden learned that the leadership had been assumed by Morris\u2019 son, who is also named Robert.\n\nThat clearly resonated with Biden, who is grieving the loss of his son, Beau. Biden spoke to Morris not as vice-president to firefighters, but as one father to another.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty cool when your son winds up better than you,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden had used much the same line during Thursday\u2019s taping of the new Stephen Colbert show, saying it was something his own father would say.\n\nOne of the firefighters signaled by his reply that Biden had passed the test. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re all right,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nBut Biden seemed to be repeating it not for effect but because his son is so much on his mind. Morris appeared to become choked up, which is not something that could have possibly happened if he had felt Biden was anything but sincere.\n\nFamilies of those who had died on 9/11 were there, sitting at tables set up for the observance on the apparatus floor, their loved ones memorialized by plaques affixed to the wall. Biden has lost a wife and a daughter as well as a son and he met with the families AS privately as circumstances allowed.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t know, these anniversaries don\u2019t get any easier,\u201d he was heard to say. \u201cIt all comes back.\u201d\n\nHe spoke to Lorraine Foley, sister of fallen Firefighter Gerard Nevins, in the shared language of loss.\n\n\u201cTook me a long, long, long time,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden also spoke to the firefighters. One later noted that he looked them in the eye and seemed actually to listen to what they had to say. They posed for a photo with him.\n\n\u201cYour reputation\u2019s going to take a hit taking a picture with me,\u201d Biden half joked.\n\nOne of the firefighters signaled by his reply that Biden had passed the test.\n\n\u201cYeah, you\u2019re all right,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nThe firefighter was not talking about Biden\u2019s politics, but about Biden himself, not his views, but his worth as a person as it might have been weighed by the brothers memorialized on those plaques. The firefighter afterwards offered a high compliment.\n\n\u201cGenuine,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nBiden had come with Billy Joel and Gov. Andrew Cuomo. He departed with them, having made a favorable enough impression on the firefighters that he would surely be welcomed back.\n\nAfterwards, one of the firefighters theorized that the very fact Biden had visited the firehouse meant he was seriously contemplating a run for president.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s interested,\u201d the firefighter said.\n\nIf Biden does run, his ability to pass an authenticity test even in a place such as the quarters of Rescue 1 could be decisive.\n\nTo be genuine would be a great strength at a time when Hillary Clinton seems ALL THE MORE contrived for trying to be spontaneous and people are responding to Donald Trump no matter what he says simply because he seems to be saying what he really thinks at that moment.\n\nIn the past, the knock on Biden has been that he utters whatever pops into his brain. Trump has made this into a big positive and that could make it the same for Biden.\n\nThe next time Biden walks into Rescue 1, he could be doing so as our president.\n\nBut even if that is so, the firefighters will likely judge him less by his politics than by whether he still looks them in the eye and listens to what they have to say, whether he still lives up to the word that will continue to make him Joe Biden, no matter how an election goes.\n\nMaybe call him Genuine Joe.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:06.966+0000"}

They\u2019re the only democracy in the Mideast and I\u2019m very supportive.\u201d Paul dismissed his past position of denying Israel foreign aid as \u201call the stuff that people try to gin up controversy\u201d over. \u201cOne day Israel should be independent and Israel will have stronger defense when they are completely independent.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not coincidentally, the first question Paul was asked on Monday, by Rabbi Pinchos Lipschutz, was prefaced with the acknowledgement that many of Lipschutz\u2019s friends believe Paul is \u201can anti-Semite!\u201d\n\n\n\nTo ease that concern, Paul has been on a steady, quiet campaign to endear himself to the Orthodox community, and he has enlisted Rush Limbaugh\u2019s rabbi/best friend to help him.\n\nPaul\u2019s campaign has brought on as an informal adviser Rabbi Nate Segal, the son of the late Rabbi Zev Segal, who rose to prominence in the 1960s as the influential leader of Orthodox organizations that actively clashed with \u201cmore liberal Jewish alternatives,\u201d in his words. \u201cRabbi Nate,\u201d as Paul refers to him, is well-regarded in Republican circles, due in no small part to his decades-long friendship with Limbaugh, which began in 1988 when Limbaugh was in hot water for comments some perceived as anti-Semitic. Segal called into Limbaugh\u2019s show, told him he hadn\u2019t said anything wrong, and promised, \u201cI will protect you.\u201d\n\nAnd now he\u2019s doing the same for Paul.\n\n\u201cRabbi Nate\u2019s been great at introducing us around the country,\u201d Paul told those populating the conference table. \u201cHe\u2019s introduced us, probably, in 10 different cities to Orthodox Jews and leaders in their communities. I\u2019ve been very privileged to be able to meet people around the country through Rabbi Nate.\u201d\n\nIn a Q&A period, Paul spoke primarily about foreign policy, repeating themes\u2014or, indeed, whole sentences\u2014that he has been telling crowds for at least a last year and a half.\n\nPaul warned of the dangers of toppling \u201csecular dictators,\u201d even going as far as to say, \u201cI think it was a mistake to topple Hussein.\u201d He used \u201cHillary\u2019s war\u201d in Libya as an example of what can go wrong when the United States intervenes too much in foreign countries, and summarized his worldview as \u201cfirst, do no harm,\u201d batting away a suggestion that he is an isolationist.\n\nPaul\u2019s audience was captive, which is, incidentally, how it felt to be in the room.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:08.303+0000"}
{"entityId": 1699, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Netanyahu\u2019s bizarre decision to make Israel a partisan issue in a country where most Jews are Democrats will damage Israel enormously.\n\nSo now Lindsey Graham has called Bibi Netanyahu to congratulate him on his great victory and to reassure him that Congress will be passing its gimlet eye closely over any deal the Obama administration strikes with Iran. This news comes hard on the heels of John Boehner\u2019s announcement that he suddenly feels moved to go visit Israel.\n\nI can\u2019t begin to conceive what these people are thinking. What does Netanyahu think he\u2019s accomplishing by making Israel a right-wing cause? Does he really think this is how he saves Israel? Does he forget that this is a country in which 70 or 80 percent of Jews vote Democratic? Did he not see the recent poll that had his approval rating among Democrats at 17 percent? I see here that last November in a J Street poll, his approval rating among U.S. Jews was 53 percent. I bet after this past month, they\u2019re down in the low 40s or high 30s.\n\nNetanyahu knows this country. He lived here\u2014high school in Philadelphia, college in Boston, and a stint in New York (when he was Israel\u2019s UN ambassador, during the Reagan years). He knows our political culture. He understands what a radical-right party the GOP is becoming, and thus he presumably understands that the vast majority of U.S. Jews are never going to be able to vote Republican, whatever the two parties\u2019 Israel lines. He knows full well that the perfervid support for Israel in evangelical-right precincts has far less to do with love of Jews than with hatred of Arabs, or, for many, the belief that Armageddon in the Middle East means Jesus is coming.\n\nHe knows all this as well as most senators and congressmen. So why does he persist in making Israel a Republicans-first issue, and for that matter why do Republicans do it too?\n\nWell, it\u2019s not hard to figure why Republicans are doing it. It\u2019s partly about Barack Obama, and the visceral loathing of him among their base; the Muslim Other-ing of Obama and all that. But they clearly must think this is going to get them more Jewish votes at the presidential level. They think back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s time. In 1980, Reagan got 39 percent of the Jewish vote, against Jimmy Carter\u2019s 45 percent (independent candidate John Anderson got the rest). That\u2019s as close as a GOP presidential candidate has ever come to winning the Jewish vote since Israel became a state. (Amusing side note: In 1948, the year of Israel\u2019s creation, the Republican candidate, Tom Dewey, did worse among Jews at 10 percent than left-wing third-party candidate Henry Wallace, who polled 15 percent; Harry Truman got 75 percent.)\n\nBut there\u2019s no remotely Reaganesque figure on the horizon. And anyway, by 1984, things were back to normal\u2014Walter Mondale, even as he was getting pasted by Reagan overall, won 67 percent of the Jewish vote. And more to the point, as I noted above, this Republican Party is not the Republican Party of Reagan\u2019s time. That was a conservative party that still had a large number of old-line moderates, like senators Charles Percy and John Heinz. Today\u2019s party is far more right wing than that one was. Very few Jews are going to vote for a party like that\u2014especially against a Clinton, if Hillary is the Democratic nominee, but in fact against pretty much anyone.\n\nSo that\u2019s what they\u2019re thinking, farkakte as it is. But this doesn\u2019t explain Netanyahu. He truly believes that a nuclear Iran is an existential threat, fine. But that doesn\u2019t explain this behavior. If he truly believes that about Iran, then the logical, self-interested thing for him to do, especially knowing that most Jews are loyal Democrats, is to get as many Democrats in Congress as possible to choose his point of view over Obama\u2019s. Given AIPAC\u2019s muscle and the traditional pro-Israel posture of most Democrats in Congress over the years, that should not be a heavy lift.\n\nIf he truly believes that about Iran, then the logical, self-interested thing for him to do, especially knowing that most Jews are loyal Democrats, is to get as many Democrats in Congress as possible to choose his point of view over Obama\u2019s.\n\nBut instead he does the opposite. Recall that about a month ago, he pointedly refused to meet with Senate Democrats. Dick Durbin and Dianne Feinstein, who invited him, were obviously tossing him a lifeline, saying to him: However bad your relationship with Obama, come square things with us, and we\u2019ll still have your back. But no. He said he feared it would look partisan, you see, because his speech to Congress, well, that was bipartisan! Once you\u2019ve entered the Hall of Mirrors, it can be hard to find your way out, I guess.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to alienate Obama (and Obama, to be fair, has done his part to sour the relationship as well). But it\u2019s quite another to alienate rank-and-file American Jews, and still another to alienate Democrats in Congress. Not an easy trifecta to hit, but he is managing it.\n\nIf he can\u2019t see the consequences for his country, he\u2019s just a madman. Let\u2019s just say hypothetically that the Obama administration follows through substantively on spokesman Josh Earnest\u2019s astonishing comments last week about the potential policy implications of Netanyahu\u2019s pre-election comportment. Let\u2019s say, for example, that the United States decides to stop blocking a vote at the United Nations on recognition of a Palestinian state. Right now, about 135 nations recognize Palestine. Very few Western European countries are among that number. Many of them withhold their support simply or mainly for the sake of not crossing the United States.\n\nOnce we signal that we won\u2019t block a vote, the map of nations that recognize Palestine will presumably expand across Europe rapidly. The British and French have worked on the proper resolution language. As it happens, the Arab League is meeting this weekend in Sharm-el-Shiekh, and you can be sure that its officials are alive to this reality. And so Netanyahu might lose Western Europe, and then he\u2019ll come crying to Washington, and it might be too late.\n\nStrange way to save a country.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:08.743+0000"}

(Trump has denied that his crack about \u201cblood coming out of her wherever\u201d was a reference to Kelly\u2019s menstrual cycle\u2014a denial regarded with near-universal disdain inside Fox News.)\n\nBut as candidate Trump has amply demonstrated, this is an exceedingly strange election cycle, in which un-poll-tested bombast from a celebrity outsider (or, for that matter, a soft-spoken yet eccentrically briefed retired neurosurgeon) seems more appealing to angry voters than carefully focus-grouped messaging from career politicians.\n\nHence Trump\u2014a self-avowed \u201cratings machine\u201d who conspicuously rejected Ailes\u2019s advice that he apologize to the star of 9 p.m.\u2019s The Kelly File, to say nothing of a tweet storm from Kelly\u2019s colleagues demanding that the ungentlemanly candidate lay off\u2014was welcomed back on the channel as though he\u2019d never been banished.\n\nActually Trump never was banned, since he has been an endless topic of Fox News punditry and chatter.

{"entityId": 1703, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, the GOP is the party of big business overall. But on the Export-Import Bank, the Democrats are the real lickspittles.\n\nWhen it comes to being pro-big business, conventional wisdom says the Republicans are most likely to distribute the goods. It\u2019s a valid criticism. Republicans are indeed big supporters of business interests. But these days, they are second to the Democrats.\n\nCase in point: The congressional Democrats\u2019 recent and unanimous support for the Export-Import Bank. A bill recently introduced by Democrats would reauthorize the bank\u2019s charter for seven years and expand its lending ability by $20 billion.\n\nThe ExIm Bank has been around for decades. Its primary activity is to extend cheap loan guarantees and direct loans to foreign companies to buy U.S goods under the pretense of boosting exports and creating jobs.\n\nDon\u2019t buy it. Economists have shown that these kinds of export credit subsidies will never raise the overall level of trade. The subsidies are also hurtful (PDF) since they simply redistribute wealth away from unsubsidized American firms, employees, and consumers and direct it toward a tiny number of beneficiaries.\n\nAnd that is where Democrats have some explaining to do: The bank\u2019s data show that it overwhelmingly benefits some of the biggest, most politically connected firms in America. In fact, in 2013, 64 percent of the bank\u2019s activities benefited 10 companies, such as Boeing, General Electric, and Caterpillar. And these companies\u2019 customers aren\u2019t poor either. For instance, the bank subsidizes wealthy foreign borrowers\u2014like mining heiress Gina Rinehart, owner of the Ex-Im-financed Roy Hill Iron Ore Mine and Australia\u2019s richest woman. She could easily find private capital without government privileges. It also subsidizes numerous state-owned companies in wealthy countries like Saudi Arabia and fast-growing airlines (PDF) like Lion Air and Air Emirates.\n\nMaybe more interesting is the fact that the biggest beneficiary on the foreign buyer side is a company named Pemex. It is a super gigantic Mexican state-owned petroleum company with a market capitalization of $416 billion. And yet it has benefited from $7 billion in U.S.-taxpayer-backed financing since 2007. I wonder how Democrats reconcile that handout with their well-known anti-fossil fuels stance.\n\nAnd that is where Democrats have some explaining to do: The bank\u2019s data show that it overwhelmingly benefits some of the biggest, most politically connected firms in America.\n\nBut the biggest beneficiaries of all are probably the lenders who earn interest on loans whose risk is borne by American taxpayers. No one explained it better than a JP Morgan banker (whose firm just happens to be the biggest private lender that benefits from Ex-Im), when he said that the bank is \u201cfree money\u201d\u2014that is, for the firms who know the right people.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of favoritism for Wall Street that Senator Elizabeth Warren says she opposes. So why does she support the bank? Warren offered the empty, canned defense that Ex-Im \u201chelps create American jobs and spur economic growth,\u201d but the truth is that the bank exists to serve the interests of a powerful few at the expense of the not-so-powerful many she claims to champion.\n\nPublic choice economics tells us that one reason that programs that should be terminated but aren\u2019t is that their benefits are concentrated on the few while the costs are spread among millions. Program beneficiaries have strong incentives to coordinate and protect their privileges. Lawmakers who are on the receiving end of the political pressure and gifts, even Democrats, have little incentives to resist them. Unfortunately, the average Americans who bear the cost do not have the time or information to organize enough opposition to defeat these programs.\n\nNow, the Democrats claim that their support has nothing to do with big businesses. They argue that it is the interests of small businesses that they are protecting. That could be true, provided you think that businesses with up to 1,500 employees and $21.5 million in revenue qualify are small, as the bank defines them. Also, if you follow the money in 2014, you will see that only 25 percent of it went to \u201csmall\u201d businesses. Subsidizing giant companies so \u201csmall\u201d businesses can get the crumbs doesn\u2019t seem like a good excuse to me.\n\nRepublicans aren\u2019t blameless either. Many do support this cronyism. But, this time around, many Republicans, under the leadership of House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling, are actually fighting to kill it. In addition, a policymaker\u2019s position on the Ex-Im Bank is now officially a litmus test for how serious he or she is in promoting small government and opportunity for all, rather than just for a well-connected few. During a recent Club For Growth meeting, every aspiring Republican presidential candidate was asked to take a position on Ex-Im, and every one of them said they would support killing it in one way or another.\n\nUnfortunately, the Democrats\u2019 support for cronyism doesn\u2019t stop at Ex-Im. Their voting records suggest that not unlike many Republicans, Democrats rarely miss an opportunity to support big businesses with government handouts. They support the Department of Energy\u2019s 1705 loans, which mostly go to wealthy energy companies (PDF), and they never fail to join Republicans in saving other corporate energy subsidies. They support Obamacare, which among other things amounts to a huge giveaway to the insurance industry.

Some civil libertarians are calling it \u2018Patriot Act 2.0.\u2019\n\nJust when you thought the fight over government surveillance powers was over, the Senate is poised for another battle, this time over a cyber security law that some civil libertarians have dubbed \u201cPatriot Act 2.0.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced that he would attach a bill aimed at improving U.S. cyber security to a mammoth defense policy bill, rather than let senators vote for the cyber measure on its own. That in and of itself is a risky move, given that the White House has already threatened to veto the defense bill. But it\u2019s also raising the hackles of some lawmakers, who see the cyber legislation as an attempt to expand government surveillance of Americans while posing as a move to fight hackers and spies.\n\n\u201cI will be fighting to ensure the Senate has a full debate and a chance to offer amendments to add vital protections for American privacy and address the threats to our cybersecurity,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden said in a statement Tuesday. Wyden, who was the only member of the Senate Intelligence Committee to vote against moving the bill forward to a full vote last March, seemed to leave open the possibility of using filibuster-style tactics to hold up the measure, just like his fellow surveillance opponent, Sen. Rand Paul, used parliamentary procedures to force some surveillance powers under the Patriot Act to expire earlier this month. The Senate voted to reinstate most of them a few days later.\n\nKeith Chu, a Wyden spokesman, told The Daily Beast that the senator hasn\u2019t made a decision about how he will proceed. \u201cBut he\u2019s making clear that [McConnell] should allow debate on the bill.\u201d\n\nOne key member of the House of Representatives, which has already passed its version of the cyber bill, is worried about a repeat of the late-night, eleventh-hour dramas that accompanied the Senate\u2019s debate over the Patriot Act, and in particular the authority it gave the National Secuirty Agency to collect Americans\u2019 phone records.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s every indication that that\u2019s likely to happen\u201d with the cyber bill, Rep. Adam Schiff, the senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, told The Daily Beast.\n\nSchiff said he didn\u2019t foresee the White House withdrawing its opposition to portions of the defense bill just to ensure that the cyber legislation passes. \u201cI think if it\u2019s an effort to bootstrap onto [the defense bill] to force the president\u2019s hand, it won\u2019t work,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it will set back the time it takes to pass cyber information sharing.\u201d\n\nThe bill \u201cwould allow the government to use private information, obtained from companies on a voluntary basis (and so without a warrant) in criminal proceedings\u2014including going after leakers under the Espionage Act.\u201d\n\nBut the stage appeared set for another showdown in the Senate. In a letter to McConnell, the chamber\u2019s four most senior Democrats called his effort to sandwich the cyber and defense bills together \u201cridiculous.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile we must ensure America\u2019s national security, we cannot trifle with Americans\u2019 civil liberties,\u201d they wrote.\n\nThe bill before the Senate, called the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act, would provide a framework for companies and the government to exchange data about cyber attacks on private computer networks, in the hopes of increasing awareness about hackers who are trying to steal to Americans\u2019 financial information, probe critical infrastructures such as the power grid, and infiltrate important computer networks in the government. But critics worry that it will create another route for companies to hand over even more personal details about innocent Americans than they already are.\n\nMcConnell\u2019s move comes on the heels of a massive breach of data from the Office of Personnel Management that exposed more than 4 million current and former federal government employees\u2019 personal information. The data were allegedly stolen by hackers in China. Schiff said the breach added \u201ca brand new sense of urgency\u201d for enacting a long-sought cyber security law.\n\nThe legislation appeared on its way toward passing two years ago when it was derailed by Edward Snowden\u2019s revelations of secret government surveillance. But the measure has gained new momentum amid a backdrop of seemingly relentless attacks by North Korea, China, Iran, and Russia.\n\nThe contours of the cyber debate are much the same as over the Patriot Act and other surveillance authorities. \u201cThe so-called cybersecurity bill in the Senate would encourage private companies to share their customers\u2019 information with the government, without giving individual Americans real assurances their private information will be protected,\u201d Wyden said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nSchiff said that in response to those concerns, the House strengthened requirements on companies to strip out any personally identifying information before they send data on hackers over to the government, and then required the government to do a second round of \u201cscrubbing\u201d to ensure that the information didn\u2019t contain anything that could identify someone who was not a threat.\n\n\u201cWe really took, in good faith, steps to dramatically reduce the privacy risks,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cThere will always be opponents to any form of intelligence authorization, in part because that\u2019s how they make their living. But I think we\u2019ve addressed the privacy concerns in a very diligent way.\u201d\n\nA group of nearly 50 technology experts and civil libertarians has warned (PDF), however, that the bill would give \u201cautomatic NSA access\u201d to information that companies share with the government and allow \u201coverbroad\u201d use of the information by law enforcement agencies, including for crimes that involve physical force or terrorism and that don\u2019t have an obvious connection to cyber attacks.\n\nThe ACLU has called the legislation \u201cone of those privacy-shredding bills in cybersecurity clothing\u201d and warned that it could be used to prosecute whistleblowers under spying laws.\n\nThe bill \u201cwould allow the government to use private information, obtained from companies on a voluntary basis (and so without a warrant) in criminal proceedings\u2014including going after leakers under the Espionage Act,\u201d the ACLU said after the bill passed the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nUnder the Senate\u2019s rules, lawmakers cannot add amendments to the bill once it is made part of the bigger defense package, but they can introduce individual amendments to that legislation.\n\nSen. Al Franken joined Wyden on Wednesday in vowing to push for a full debate and the chance to modify the cyber provisions. \u201cI will oppose this move\u201d to lump the bills together, Franken said. \u201cThe American people deserve better; they deserve a transparent legislative process and a bill that promotes cyber security without jeopardizing their rights.\u201d\n\nBut the measure has strong support in the House, where an earlier version passed overwhelmingly. And business leaders have issued strong statements of support for the measure\u2019s swift passage. The Financial Services Roundtable, which represents banks and other financial companies, and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association are both backing the bill. The financial services sector is one of the key areas of the economy that the bill\u2019s backers mean to shore up.\n\n\u201cThe industry\u2014as a whole and in partnership with the government\u2014has dedicated tremendous resources to mitigate cyber threats to protect the integrity of the capital markets and the millions of people who use financial services every day,\u201d Kenneth E. Bentsen Jr., the president and CEO of the securities group, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cAs we\u2019ve seen from recent events, there is too much to lose by inaction.\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:11.258+0000"}
{"entityId": 1707, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "How Dems can peel off GOP voters via a tried and true right-wing tactic.\n\nHere\u2019s a little datum that may have slid by you: Gallup has just found that on social issues, the country is now equally split between liberals and conservatives. The question was: \u201cThinking about social issues, would you say your views are\u201d very conservative, conservative, liberal, or very liberal?\n\nAnd the answer came back: Grouping the first two into one category and the last two into another, it was a dead heat at 31 percent each. This is pretty close to seismic. Just five years ago, the conservative edge on social issues was 39 to 22 percent. Now it\u2019s totally wiped out. The implications for our electoral politics are obvious and enormous, and I mean good-enormous.\n\nI\u2019m not sure when people started using the phrase \u201cwedge issue.\u201d But we\u2019re all sure what wedge issues are: They\u2019re cultural politics issues used in elections by the right\u2014and always only the right\u2014to drive a wedge into the liberal coalition. Nixon did it expertly, even though the phrase wasn\u2019t in use back then. Reagan did it well, cleaving so many working-class white ethnics away from the Democratic Party. George H.W. Bush and Jim Baker did it\u2014remember Willie Horton (race was the original wedge issue). And Bush the younger and Karl Rove expanded it out to include guns and gays.\n\nAnd now, Gallup is suggesting to us, the era of the wedge issue may be over.\n\nBut wait! Why should it be over? Maybe it\u2019s time for some liberal wedge issues! I like the sound of that a lot.\n\nGay marriage was a great wedge issue for Dubya and Rove in 2004, as you\u2019ll recall. They got anti-gay marriage initiatives on the ballot in 11 states, many of them key swing states; studies have tended to find that in Ohio, which Bush carried and which was the difference between victory and defeat in the Electoral College, the initiative did goose evangelical turnout a bit (and remember, Bush won the state by just 118,000 votes out of around 5.6 million cast). It may have also helped him win more African Americans than he would have otherwise, hence the wedge.\n\nWell, in 2016, same-sex marriage can be a wedge issue again, but this time, for our team. The numbers are now so decisive that surely in the key swing states with the bushels of electoral votes, the likely Democratic candidate can cast shame upon the head of her opponent. In Florida, support for gay marriage was 57 percent a year ago, and it\u2019s probably a little higher now. In Ohio, support-to-opposition was 52-37 in 2012, and that\u2019s surely higher now. In Virginia in 2013, support registered at 56 percent. The issue isn\u2019t a loser in any important swing state, with the possible exception of North Carolina, which of course is just icing for the Democrats anyway.\n\nHow could Hillary Clinton and her party use this, exactly? That gets a little harder to say. The thing that makes a wedge issue a wedge issue is that, historically anyway, it\u2019s been about fear. The blacks are coming. The gays are coming. The anti-gun nuts are going to be pounding on your door, warrant in hand. As has often been said, it\u2019s the best motivator in politics.\n\nRepublicans will still roll out their wedge issues, but it seems that the pickings are pretty slim. Fear just isn\u2019t selling.\n\nThe crucial psychic element of fear-mongering is that you have to persuade the majority that some minority is \u201ctaking over\u201d and they, your majority, will soon be the trampled minority unless they act. That\u2019s what gets the blood cooking in the old amygdala. (What?! Microsoft Word doesn\u2019t recognize amygdala?!) Conservatives are much better at this than liberals are, and in any case, if liberals tried this it just wouldn\u2019t make sense or work. Everybody knows that the anti-same-sex-marriage side is losing fast, so fear is a non-starter here.\n\nNo, the psychic ingredient of the liberal wedge campaign has to be something else. And of course it has to resonate with people on some level, be in tune with what they\u2019re actually thinking. So, what are people (not just liberals, but average, quasi-informed people) thinking about conservatives right now? I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s that they\u2019re just out of it. Out of touch with the times. Holding us back.\n\nCertainly this is so with respect to same-sex marriage, although the problem is hardly limited to that by a long shot. One issue I\u2019d really love to see Clinton and the Democrats plop down smack in the middle of the table this election is the way conservatism today just strangles opportunity for middle-class people, and for young people in particular, in the name of their messianic tax-cutting.\n\nTPM ran a great piece Friday on how the Republican governors who are running for president are destroying their higher-education systems in the name of cutting state income taxes and never, ever raising another tax of any kind. Bobby Jindal has cut taxes six times in Louisiana, which has produced a $1.6 billion shortfall. To plug the gap, he\u2019s cutting higher-ed funding by as much as $600 million, which is 82 percent of state higher-ed aid. Scott Walker\u2019s half-a-billion dollars in tax cuts in Wisconsin have led to a $2 billion shortfall, so he\u2019s slashing higher ed by $300 million.\n\nThese, too, are wedge issues, if you ask me. Republicans send their kids to college too. Yes, they like their tax cuts. But I would assume that they don\u2019t like whopping tuition hikes, or their kids having to drop out of college altogether, any more than Democrats or independents do. If the Democrats can connect these dots in the right way\u2014on this and a whole range of Warrenesque \u201chousehold economics\u201d issues\u2014they can peel off a decent chunk of voters who have been traditionally Republican.\n\nRepublicans will still roll out their wedge issues, but it seems that the pickings are pretty slim. Fear just isn\u2019t selling. To borrow from A.J. Liebling\u2019s nice line about sweet Louisiana corn, fear just doesn\u2019t travel well anymore outside the right-wing base. Muslim-bashing may be the exception to that, but even that won\u2019t work without a triggering event of some kind. Republicans might actually have to talk about issues.

Joe Biden had met the father several times in the early days of 1988 when Biden was running for president and now in the fading summer of 2012, at the edge of another fierce campaign, a re-election campaign, Biden asked for the father\u2019s phone number.\n\nIt was more than a condolence call. The two men spoke for nearly an hour; Biden an expert in loss, in carrying a cargo of sorrow, in dealing with the pain that arrives and never really leaves after a death that scars the soul.\n\nHe is, perhaps, the least complicated man in public life. It\u2019s all right there, on display, for anyone and everyone to hear and see, to criticize or applaud. There is no filter, sometimes to his detriment. There is never any pretense. There is never, not ever, any attempt to hide or even disguise an emotion.\n\nHe is thoroughly Irish and tribal to his core. He leans on one weapon for defense against the inevitable assaults that come with living a full life, any life: his family.\n\nHe is, by nature, a happy guy, an optimistic guy who regards self-pity as an infectious agent to be avoided. He is a true believer in his faith, in his family, in his friends, and in the future.\n\nAnd today his name is in a swirl of headlines surrounding speculation that maybe, perhaps, who knows, he might run for president after all. According to several people around the vice president, Maureen Dowd\u2019s piece in Sunday\u2019s New York Times was both accurate and descriptive of where he is today as the political world watches Hillary Clinton\u2019s seemingly inevitable yet stumbling march toward the Democrat\u2019s nomination.\n\nHowever, there is this one thing, this one nagging question that hovers above Hillary Clinton like a crop duster with a full tank of gas. It\u2019s been there for nearly three decades. It\u2019s always there, won\u2019t go away and seems as if it\u2019s never really fully answered and it is this: Who is she? Really, who is she?\n\nNobody wonders who Joe Biden is.\n\nHe is still the guy who was so excited to be picked for the team that he slept in his uniform the night before his first Little League game. He is the guy who sometimes still thinks his mother might shake him awake at dawn, saying \u201cGet up, Joey, or you\u2019ll be late for school,\u201d because part of him cannot believe all the wonders, the magic, that has been contained in his life.\n\nHe has never blamed God for a single tragedy. He has hit every morning as if the day ahead was a buffet and, \u201cgoddamnit,\u201d he was going to sample every single item on the table. Wasn\u2019t going to waste a second. And you\u2014no matter who you were, no matter what you did for a living or where you came from or when he met you\u2014if you were there with him, well, \u201cgoddamnit,\u201d try this and have some of that, too. Why not? We\u2019re all just passing through, aren\u2019t we?\n\nNow they\u2019re talking about Biden and the presidency again. A single story on a summer Sunday and Joe Biden\u2019s name is injected into the vein of a business\u2014national politics\u2014that has most sane people feeling dejected, enraged, and distant from a process that barely moves the needle of their lives.\n\nAnd where was the vice president? Home. In Wilmington, Delaware, where he goes almost every weekend, away from the capital of no-eye-contact where shapers, frauds, political grifters, and the chronically ambitious always look over the shoulder of who they\u2019re talking with to check and see if a brighter light, a more powerful person, has come into the room.\n\nHe was home\u2026 with his family. Home, worrying about the financial future of his son\u2019s wife and their children, the survivors. Home, to keep both hands on the shoulders of a family still fractured by loss, still, always, carrying the spirit and the memory of his boy Beau, the future.\n\nHe is Irish and tribal with the inevitable streak of black Irish in him, figuring no matter how many great things have happened in his life there\u2019s a dark cloud out there somewhere with his name on it. And it\u2019s been overhead more than once.\n\nHe is the vice president of the United States. And only he and that family, that tribe, know, really know, what\u2019s on his mind about one last run for the Oval Office. Does he have the energy? Does he have the desire to put the people he holds closest to him, all of them almost always held in the palm of his hand, through the gauntlet of what would be his final campaign?\n\nBut here is what we do know: The guy who wore his Little League uniform to bed that long gone night before his first game in Scranton, that guy who wrote to his injured sons nearly every day as he took the train to Washington each morning after their mother was killed, that man who called the grieving father of a dead Marine\u2026 he is the same guy today as he\u2019s always been.\n\nThat\u2019s why nobody will ever have to wonder who Joe Biden is.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:12.630+0000"}

But one conservative with Vegas ties, Sheldon Adelson, is throwing as much money at he can at the opposition in an effort to stop it.\n\nNevada Republicans may find themselves in a fog on the medical marijuana issue. The state\u2019s first medical marijuana law was signed in 2001, but bringing that approval to fruition has taken more than a decade. Dispensaries and grow houses, divvied up among Nevada\u2019s handful of power players and their friends, are in the final stages of preparation.\n\n\n\nAnd even notable Republican advisor and friend-of-the Bush family Sig Rogich once had a piece of the action.\n\nNow, U.S. Senator Dean Heller has added his name to the pro-pot side of the Nevada GOP by signing on as a co-sponsor of the bipartisan Compassionate Access, Research Expansion and Respect States (CARERS) Act, which would ensure states the right to determine their own medical marijuana policies and laws. Other supporters include libertarian (and likely Republican presidential candidate) Senator Rand Paul and liberal Democrats Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\nNevada Republicans, traditionally about as cool as a crewcut, are finally getting with the times.\n\n\u201cIn Nevada, no Republican who values his future would dare cross Sheldon the Sugar Daddy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe time has come for the federal government to stop impeding the doctor-patient relationship in states that have decided their own medical marijuana policies,\u201d Heller said. \u201cThis bipartisan legislation puts Americans who are suffering first by allowing Nevada\u2019s medical marijuana patients, providers, and businesses that are in compliance with state law, to no longer be in violation of federal law and vulnerable to federal prosecution.\u201d\n\nNevada State Sen. Richard \u201cTick\u201d Segerblom, a Democrat from Las Vegas, is the key political player behind the medical marijuana movement and the push onward toward full legalization.\n\n\n\n\u201cSenate Majority Leader Harry Reid is publicly on record as supporting medical marijuana,\u201d Segerblom said. \u201cI\u2019m pleasantly surprised about Sen. Heller. He obviously knows that Nevada Republicans have a strong libertarian streak in them which supports marijuana, and there is strong support in the Mormon community, too.\u201d\n\nA new federal law would come as a big relief to several family members of Nevada casino licensees. This is following an announcement by Gaming Control Board Chairman A.G. Burnett that privileged gaming status could be jeopardized because of marijuana\u2019s illegal federal status. That\u2019s the irony in Nevada, where rising-star Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval is on the record opposing recreational use of marijuana, but in 2013 signed medical pot dispensary legislation into law.\n\nThe federal legislation would allow Veterans Administration physicians to prescribe medical marijuana for treatment. Nevada is home to more than 300,000 veterans.\n\nUnspoken in Heller\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of the CARERS Act legislation is the public opposition taken on the medical pot issue by Nevada\u2019s biggest wealthiest casino titan, Sheldon Adelson. The national Republican Party mega-donor last year pumped a reported $5.5 million into the successful Drug Free Florida campaign against medicinal marijuana legalization. With a personal net worth of $36.4 billion in 2014, according to Forbes, the Las Vegas Sands chairman has emerged as the GOP\u2019s biggest political oligarch in recent years, pouring more than $100 million into campaigns up and down the ticket.\n\nPresidential hopefuls and congressional bosses alike court Adelson assiduously, buzzing his Strip resorts like worker bees as they seek his good graces and fat campaign checkbook. In Nevada, no Republican who values his future would dare cross Sheldon the Sugar Daddy.\n\nDrug Free Florida made headlines when it named former Ronald Reagan drug Czar Carlton Turner as its chairman. While best known for helping to create Reagan\u2019s \u201cJust Say No\u201d anti-drug campaign, Turner also said marijuana use leads to homosexuality and, potentially, to AIDS.\n\nPolls showed as much as 70 percent of voting Floridians favored legalizing for medicinal use. A University of Florida poll found that 67 percent of the state\u2019s residents endorsed its use for medical reasons.\n\nBut what did they know?\n\nAdelson\u2019s $5.5 million\u2014approximately 85 percent of the money raised by the opposition\u2014bought a lot of political fear-mongering. In November, Amendment 2, the right to medical marijuana in Florida, failed to garner the 60 percent needed for constitutional change. It was one of the free-spending Adelson\u2019s few victories in that election (although these days he\u2019s said to have been celebrating his role in helping to re-elect Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.)\n\nAttempts to get Adelson\u2019s fresh perspective on the medical marijuana issue were unsuccessful. But it\u2019s been widely reported in Florida that Adelson\u2019s interest in legalizing casino gambling might have been the prime motivator behind his public battle against the evils of legitimizing medical marijuana.\n\nAt the time, the monied meddling in the marijuana measure infuriated some observers, including Tallahassee Democrat columnist Paula Dockery, who wondered aloud, \u201cWhat? You\u2019re not familiar with Sheldon? Maybe that\u2019s because he lives thousands of miles away in Las Vegas. But rest assured legislators and the governor know him. He and his lobbyists have been courting those in power to get expanded casino gambling here in Florida. Odd that someone perfectly fine with drinking and gambling could be so offended by legalized medical marijuana to help those with debilitating illness.\u201d\n\nYes, isn\u2019t it?\n\nAs you might imagine, the Nevada Democrat Segerblom remains suspicious of Adelson\u2019s motives.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m waiting for him to show his hand,\u201d the longtime legislator said. \u201cMaybe Florida was an outlier, but to the extend he openly opposes marijuana in Nevada he will become the issue\u2014and Sheldon is someone everyone loves to hate. The truth is the public is so far ahead of the politicians when it comes to marijuana it\u2019s scary.\u201d\n\nAdelson, whose wife Dr. Miriam Adelson is an addiction specialist, was reported opposed to legalizing medical marijuana because he believed it to be a gateway drug.\n\nWhile Nevada Republicans have warmed up to medicinal marijuana\u2019s legalization, will ultimate party boss Adelson\u2019s anti-prescription pot politics one day open the gateway that leads to legalized casinos in Florida?\n\nJohn L.

{"entityId": 1712, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Just when you think the GOP might modernize, the knuckles start dragging again, this time on immigration and trade. It\u2019s political suicide.\n\nIf you want to see where the impulse to reform the Republican Party in a more libertarian direction of limited government, social tolerance, and free markets goes to die, look no further than the recent attacks on immigration and freer trade by Jeff Sessions, the influential senator from Alabama. Every time the GOP seems finally ready to orient itself in a forward-looking, post-culture-war direction, some holdover from an America that never quite existed to begin with blows his whistle and the next generation of would-be party leaders fall into line like the obedient von Trapp children in Sound of Music.\n\nIndeed, Scott Walker has explicitly attributed his remarkable flip-flop on immigration to conversations with Sessions. Just a few years ago, the Wisconsin governor and leading Republican presidential candidate used to favor liberal immigration and a path to citizenship for illegals. Now he\u2019s calling for \u201cno amnesty\u201d and universal, invasive, and error-prone E-Verify systems for \u201cevery employer...particularly small businesses and farmers and ranchers.\u201d\n\nThe three-term, 68-year-old Sessions is \u201cthe Senate\u2019s anti-immigration warrior,\u201d according to Politico, and he wants to curb not just illegal and low-skill immigration but also the number of folks chasing the American Dream under H1-B visas, which apply to \u201cworkers in short supply\u201d who are sponsored by specific employers with specialized needs.\n\nIn a recent Washington Post op-ed, Sessions complained that \u201clegal immigration is the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States.\u201d Exhibiting the zero-sum, fixed-pie economic thinking that conservatives and Republicans routinely chastise in liberals and Democrats, Sessions continues, \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough jobs for our lower-skilled workers now. What sense does it make to bring in millions more?\u201d\n\nFully 84 percent of Republicans are dissatisfied with current legal immigration levels, a super-majority that only shows how out of touch the GOP faithful is with the rest of the country.\n\nHis solution is a time out on foreigners, \u201cso that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together.\u201d Only \u201cthe financial elite (and the political elite who receive their contributions)\u201d could possibly object, argues Sessions in full populist mode. Immigrants keep \u201cwages down and profits up....That is why [elites] have tried to enforce silence in the face of public desire for immigration reductions.\u201d\n\nSessions brings the same populist and anti-immigrant animus to his critique of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the trade deal the Obama administration is brokering between the United States and 11 other countries. Sessions, along with progressive Democrats such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Martin O\u2019Malley, only see the shadowy machinations of elites at work in the reauthorization of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) or \u201cfast-track\u201d negotiations.\n\nSuch rules, which have been standard operating procedure since 1974, allow the executive branch to negotiate terms and then bring the deal to Congress for an up or down vote. Citing \u201cthe rapid pace of immigration and globalization,\u201d Sessions wants not \u201ca \u2018fast-track\u2019 but a regular track.\u201d He, Warren, and others charge that negotiations under TPA are \u201csecret\u201d and are somehow selling out basic American \u201csovereignty\u201d\u2014despite the fact that any deal will be voted on by Congress.\n\nSessions will lose the vote against TPA, just as the Republicans will ultimately lose the battle over restricting immigration. Contra Sessions, there is no clear public desire for reducing immigration, except among Republicans. Fully 84 percent of Republicans are dissatisfied with the current generous levels, a super-majority that only shows how out of touch the GOP faithful is with the rest of the country. Earlier this year, Gallup found that 54 percent of Americans are either satisfied with current levels of immigration or want more immigration. Just 39 percent were dissatisfied and want less immigration, which is 11 points lower than the same figure in 2008.\n\nThe majority of Americans embrace immigration for a lot of different reasons. Part of it is our history and sense of national identity and part of it is a basic if unarticulated recognition of what economists on the right and left have consistently found: \u201cOn average, immigrant workers increase the opportunities and incomes of Americans.\u201d\n\nLeave aside the fact that immigrants are twice as likely to start their own businesses as native-born Americans. The fact is they tend to be either higher- or lower-skilled than the typical worker, so they complement rather than displace natives. And, as the Cato Institute\u2019s Alex Nowrasteh documents in his exhaustive rebuttal to Sessions\u2019s Washington Post piece, immigrants not only consume less welfare and commit less crime than the average American, they pay taxes (often without any hope of getting the money back) and stop coming when the economy sours. If you think immigrants cause problems, check out the parts of the country that nobody is moving to and you\u2019ll understand that it\u2019s precisely when migrants stop coming that your real troubles are starting.\n\nSadly, lived reality holds little appeal for Sessions and Republicans such as Walker, who are instead doing their damnedest to turn the party of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush decisively against its long and glorious history of relatively open borders and freer trade. In a remarkable 1980 debate between Reagan and Bush I, the two candidates for the GOP nomination literally outdid themselves not simply in praising legal immigrants but illegal ones:\n\n\n\nIn the 2012 election, Mitt Romney pulled just 27 percent of the increasingly important Hispanic vote. That was despite the fact that Barack Obama is, in Nowrasteh\u2019s accurate term, \u201cDeporter in Chief\u201d who repatriated more immigrants far more quickly than George W. Bush. Hispanics aren\u2019t stupid\u201444 percent of them voted for immigrant-friendly Bush in 2004. They knew things could always get worse and probably would for them under Romney.\n\nWith 2016 coming into clearer and clearer focus\u2014and with Hillary Clinton doing her own flip-flop on immigration and now embracing newcomers\u2014the GOP and its presidential candidates have a choice to make. They can follow Ronald Reagan\u2019s example and embrace libertarian positions on immigration and free trade. Or they can follow Jeff Sessions\u2019s retrograde populism and see just how few Hispanic votes they can pull.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:13.051+0000"}

Lord Business presides over a totalitarian, corporate surveillance state.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s done for a reason,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting that propaganda, and it\u2019s insidious.\u201d\n\nAfter the HuffPo story made the rounds, the senator returned fire with an angry blog post, doubling down on his anti-Lego Movie position.\n\n\u201cSome liberal writer at the Huffington Post was excited to find out that I\u2019ve been talking to Wisconsinites about how enthusiastically the entertainment media spread a \u2018business is bad\u2019 message,\u201d he blogged. \u201cHe seems to get hung up on the way I mentioned The Lego Movie\u2026The strange thing isn\u2019t that a kids\u2019 movie was anti-business, it is that someone claiming to be a journalist never encountered the idea before.\u201d\n\nJohnson\u2019s comments\u2014and follow-up angry-blogging\u2014serves as a bit of a revival of the original conservative freakout over The Lego Movie early last year, upon the film\u2019s theatrical release. The critically acclaimed kids\u2019 movie, which doubles as a political and social satire, made some news in February 2014 after it became the target of certain commentators in conservative media, including The Weekly Standard and Fox News\u2019s sister channel.

If he\u2019s trying to push her left, his efforts are wasted, Clinton advisers say.\n\nDuring a Democratic primary season in which Hillary Clinton\u2019s putative opponents have pointedly declined to criticize her, Bill de Blasio has emerged as the voice of the liberal opposition, declining to endorse her on national television on the day she announced her candidacy, traveling to the early primary states to tout his vision for the Democratic Party, and on Tuesday unveiling a \u201cProgressive Contract With America\u201d alongside dozens of fellow travelers in Washington, D.C.\n\nBut if all that activity is supposed to rally the Democratic base to pull Clinton to the left, the Clinton campaign would like to thank de Blasio very much for his effort, but says it is unnecessary.\n\n\u201cFor her entire career, Hillary Clinton has championed many of the issues included in this contract,\u201d said Karen Finney, senior campaign spokeswoman. \u201cShe has a long record of pushing for progress on issues like family leave, income inequality, and education, and she looks forward to continuing the conversation around these important topics as she lays out her own ideas in this campaign.\u201d\n\nIndeed, many of the nearly a dozen Clinton advisers and supporters contacted for this article said they welcomed de Blasio\u2019s forays into presidential politics, as so much of what he has been trying to do is create a constituency that dovetailed with Clinton\u2019s own record and platform. Most of the issues de Blasio touts in his Progressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality, like a higher minimum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy, have been pushed by President Obama, to little avail, and Clinton has spoken out in favor of them.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton has a long career of advocating for progressive issues\u2014the minimum wage, issues important to women,\u201d said Jack Rosen, a New York-based real estate executive and longtime donor to Bill and Hillary Clinton. \u201cDe Blasio has a right to speak out on issues he cares about, but Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t need any advice. She has her own inner compass on this.\u201d\n\nTom Sheridan, a top D.C lobbyist and a donor to the Clinton campaign, said that by trying to pressure Clinton from the left, de Blasio was actually creating space for Clinton to position herself as palatable to the broad middle.\n\n\u201cHe is giving her running room and new ways to position herself on these issues,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s all good, I really do. You have people trying to put pressure on the left wing and the right wing, and Hillary gets to show that she knows how to fly the plane, so to speak.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the purpose of this is to put pressure on our candidate, there are better ways to do it, and it\u2019s unnecessary anyway.\u201d\n\nPolls show that Clinton remains strongly popular with even the most liberal elements of the party, though grassroots organizers continue to push Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as a populist challenger to her. Robert Wolf, a former CEO of UBS Americas and friend of Obama who has already signed on to the Clinton campaign financial operation, predicted that the impact of de Blasio\u2019s press conference Tuesday on the Clinton campaign would be minimal, especially once Clinton flushes out more of her own agenda.\n\n\u201cTo me the candidates that are talking about real issues like the secretary last week on immigration versus trying to rally the far left or the far right seem to get the most traction to the thoughtful person, as opposed to getting the most media hype of the day,\u201d Wolf told The Daily Beast.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say Team Clinton isn\u2019t a bit mystified at what de Blasio is doing. The New York City mayor owes his career in part to Clinton, having served as campaign manager for her 2000 run for the U.S. Senate, then parlaying that experience into his first political run. Bill Clinton inaugurated de Blasio as mayor, while Hillary Clinton looked on. \u201cI am proud to come from the Clinton family,\u201d de Blasio told reporters after he won the Democratic nomination.\n\n\u201cIf he were running for president, that would be one thing, but he is not,\u201d said Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic strategist and longtime adviser to both Clintons. \u201cPeople who hold elective office like to get covered and like to be heard and like to be part of the conversation. I take him at face value.\u201d\n\nPeople in and close to the Clinton campaign say they take de Blasio at his word, that he is not running for president (despite a New York Post report to the contrary). Rather, they assume he is trying either to elevate his national profile and capitalize on a Democratic base yearning for a standard-bearer, or trying to shore up his credentials with progressives in New York in the face of sinking poll numbers and what could be a potentially competitive reelection in 2017.\n\n\u201cI know Bill de Blasio like the back of my hand,\u201d said Manhattan borough president Gale Brewer, who served with de Blasio in the David Dinkins administration in City Hall and in the City Council, and who was one of the first New York City elected officials to endorse the Ready for Hillary super PAC that laid the groundwork for another Clinton run.\n\n\u201cHe thinks this is part of his official duties as mayor,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course, you elevate yourself when you do that, but in his head it is about elevating the city.\u201d\n\nBrewer said she was supportive of the mayor\u2019s efforts if it meant getting more resources to the city. If it also meant getting Clinton to tack left, well, good luck.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that is helpful,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cShe is going to do what she needs to do to win the election. I don\u2019t know too many people who are listening to what Bill de Blasio is saying about Hillary Clinton being to the left or not. They are judging Hillary Clinton on her own pluses and minuses.\u201d\n\nMuch of the Democratic establishment backed Clinton long before she was even a candidate, even many of those who appeared alongside de Blasio at his press conference in Washington on Tuesday. If de Blasio\u2019s non-endorsement on Meet the Press was a bit curious, few Clintonistas doubted that he would eventually come around.\n\n\u201cI was with Bill de Blasio in the 2000 Senate campaign. I bumped into him several times in Ohio in 2008 when he was campaigning for Hillary,\u201d said Ann Lewis, a longtime Clinton adviser. \u201cAnd I fully expect to be campaigning with him again.\u201d\n\nFormer Rep. Anthony Weiner, a one-time de Blasio opponent\u2014and whose wedding to a Hillary Clinton aide was officiated by Bill Clinton\u2014agreed. He said de Blasio had every right to step out on the national stage as mayor of New York but that he was not sure exactly what the point of it all would be.\n\n\u201cIt takes some hubris here to suggest that Hillary Clinton doesn\u2019t understand the challenges of inequality or the challenges facing our country,\u201d Weiner said. \u201cSo what are you going to do, say, \u2018I am going to hold my breath until Hillary becomes a good Democrat?\u2019 If the purpose of this is to put pressure on our candidate, there are better ways to do it, and it\u2019s unnecessary anyway.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:14.169+0000"}

But beyond those drinking the Kool-Aid, Democrats don\u2019t want him as their standard-bearer in a hotly contested race that\u2019s key to winning the Senate majority.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a love-him-or-hate-him guy, and he doesn\u2019t get much love outside the Netroots progressive core,\u201d says Brad Coker of Mason Dixon Polling and Research. \u201cThe money people in Florida wouldn\u2019t support him.\u201d\n\nEfforts to dissuade Grayson from running only seem to egg him on, and to energize his voters. A Mason Dixon poll released Monday showed a tight race, with Grayson at 33 percent, and Representative Patrick Murphy, who has been endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, at 32 percent, with 35 percent undecided.\n\n\u201cGrayson is the Republican\u2019s dream opponent,\u201d says Coker. \u201cMurphy would have a fighting chance.\u201d\n\nWhere Grayson is a liberal firebrand with a penchant for making inflammatory statements, Murphy is a CPA with an accountant\u2019s cautious demeanor. He was a Republican until 2011, and says he left the GOP to protest the Tea Party takeover. Grayson\u2019s campaign calls Murphy a \u201cfake Democrat\u201d and a Wall Street clone, but those Republican credentials, and a check he wrote to Mitt Romney in 2007, wouldn\u2019t hurt him in the general election.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing right now that would get the stubborn Grayson out of the race. But Democrats are getting ready to pile on, and they\u2019ve got plenty to work with. Grayson manages at least two hedge funds incorporated in the Cayman Islands, a well-known tax haven, and he has not been fully transparent about those activities, the income he derives and possible conflicts of interest, prompting two ethics complaints to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nOne is from The Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, a nonpartisan watchdog group; the other is from the St. Lucie County Democratic chairwoman, Celeste Bush, who charges that Grayson has not properly disclosed the source and amount of his outside income on financial disclosure forms. Grayson is among the wealthiest members of Congress, with a net worth of over $30 million.\n\n\u201cGrayson is a loose cannon. He\u2019s defending his overseas hedge funds while he calls his wife of 25 years and the mother of his five children a gold digger.\u201d\n\nHis private life is also a target of opportunity for Democrats wanting to torpedo his candidacy. After much acrimony, his marriage was annulled in 2014 after 25 years and five children on the grounds of bigamy\u2014that his now ex-wife had not been legally free to marry him. When news reports last year found his family had qualified for food stamps, and his children were receiving free school lunches, Grayson blamed his ex, telling a local TV station, \u201cI\u2019ll sum it up for you: Gold diggers gotta dig.\u201d\n\nAs the heat gets turned up on Grayson, will the voters rally to his side, or will they see the light?\n\n\u201cIf he can behave himself, he\u2019ll be able to stay [in the race],\u201d says Brad Coker, the pollster. \u201cHe\u2019s sort of like Trump: You\u2019re waiting for him to implode.\u201d\n\nGrayson may not be able to win a Senate seat, or even win the primary, but his candidacy comes with a cost. Democrats pitted against Democrats in Florida echoes what\u2019s happening nationally among Republicans as they try to squelch Donald Trump without alienating his rabid supporters, who enjoy giving the middle finger to the political establishment.\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, Alan Grayson will do more damage to himself and to our Democratic Party as a whole than he could ever do to Patrick Murphy,\u201d Celeste Bush said in an email. She feels so strongly about Grayson that in April she urged party leaders to de-certify the Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida for promoting his entry into the Senate race.\n\n\u201cGrayson is a loose cannon. He\u2019s defending his overseas hedge funds while he calls his wife of 25 years and the mother of his five children a gold digger,\u201d Bush said in her email. \u201cAs a mom, that\u2019s more than offensive. This is not someone that represents our values and he won\u2019t run a campaign we can be proud of.\u201d\n\nFlorida attorney John Morgan, a big Hillary supporter and a self-described flaming liberal, says his politics are much closer to Grayson\u2019s than to Murphy\u2019s or Florida Senator Bill Nelson\u2019s. But Morgan thinks Grayson is making a big mistake by running.\n\n\u201cAlan is a friend of mine, he\u2019s a client of mine, and I tried mightily to dissuade him from walking away from a national platform that most congressmen and women do not have,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cHe\u2019s like Barney Frank\u2014he was a congressman from Massachusetts and he was America\u2019s congressman, progressive America\u2019s congressman. I told him, \u2018I hate to see a smart guy like you walk away from the Congress because I don\u2019t see a path forward for you in Florida.\u2019\u201d\n\nTo understand what it takes for a Democrat to win statewide in Florida, look at Nelson\u2019s career, says Morgan. The former astronaut, elected in 2000 and twice reelected, is broadly liberal, but must always be mindful of his right flank.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tightrope with no room for error, it\u2019s threading a needle with a fine piece of thread,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cYou have to be able to do well in the Panhandle. I\u2019m a fan of Alan\u2019s politics but he has a lot of minuses. He told me if Charlie Crist got in the race, he would get out.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a stunner considering Crist hit the trifecta, losing races as a Republican, an independent, and as a Democrat. Why would Grayson move over for Crist and not Murphy? \u201cJealous is a harsh word,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cIt\u2019s more \u2018It\u2019s my turn, not his. How does this young kid, 32 years old, get this opportunity when I\u2019m the smartest guy in the room?\u2019\u201d\n\nMorgan used to think that come April or May of 2016, if the polls weren\u2019t looking good, Grayson could always come back and run for his seat. But now his girlfriend, Dena Minning, a self-described biotechnology entrepreneur with no political experience, has jumped into the race for Grayson\u2019s House seat along with Grayson\u2019s most trusted administrative aide and at least two other entrants.\n\n\u201cHow does he say to his girlfriend, \u2018I\u2019m coming back,\u2019\u201d says Morgan. \u201cI used to think he had a way to walk this back, but he\u2019s painted himself into a corner.\u201d Still, voters might as well kick back and enjoy the spectacle.

{"entityId": 1718, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "They fought the Affordable Care Act, and helped torpedo Hillarycare. Then they rained money on Clinton loyalists.\n\nBy Alec MacGillis, ProPublica\n\nWhen the former head of the U.S. government\u2019s health insurance programs was hired in July to run a lobby that had spent tens of millions of dollars trying to derail Obamacare, it was more than just another spin of Washington\u2019s revolving door.\n\nMarilyn Tavenner, former administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, became chief executive of America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans, the industry\u2019s main lobbying group, which is known as AHIP. As the latest of a half-dozen prominent architects and overseers of Obamacare to move into the health industry, her move signified growing ties between health insurers and Democrats despite battles over the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe relationship has long been marked by ambivalence and tension. Tavenner\u2019s predecessor at AHIP, Karen Ignagni, was a former Democratic staffer on Capitol Hill, but the insurance lobby led the way in defeating the Clinton health coverage plan in 1993 and secretly spent about $100 million to attack Obamacare even as it negotiated to make it palatable to the industry. More recently, as the law added millions to the insurance rolls and generated big profits for many companies, they have turned to defending it.\n\nThe connections may continue or strengthen if Hillary Clinton wins the Democratic nomination and the presidency. That\u2019s because a Washington firm called the Dewey Square Group, which is closely identified with the Clinton campaign, was at the center of the industry\u2019s efforts to win influence among Democrats\u2014at a time when the two sides were sharply opposed.\n\nAs it helps corporations play both sides of the street, Dewey Square stands as a primary example of an ascendant breed in the Washington influence industry: Democratic consulting firms that, over time, have expanded from advising political campaigns into advising industry groups.\n\nWhile these firms may do actual lobbying here and there, their main service is what\u2019s known as \u201cgrass-tops organizing,\u201d to help corporate clients win over Democratic constituencies. Others in the business, including Glover Park Group and SKDKnickerbocker, also lean Democratic. Their clients generally need less help reaching Republicans.\n\nThe Dewey Square Group, which is closely identified with the Clinton campaign, was at the center of the insurance industry\u2019s efforts to win influence among Democrats\u2014at a time when the two sides were sharply opposed.\n\nAmong Dewey Square\u2019s clients have been the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which hired the firm to fight for limits on damages that can be awarded in lawsuits\u2014a longtime plank in the Republican platform\u2014by invoking the plight of Hispanic restaurant owners taken to court; the National Restaurant Association, which paid Dewey Square $772,000 in 2009 as it was fighting legislation that would make it easier for unions to organize workers; and the Private Equity Growth Council, which paid it $188,544 in 2009. And in 2012, Dewey Square was hired by the advocacy campaign Fix the Debt, which pushed an austerity approach to budget deficits.\n\nDewey Square was founded in Boston in 1993 by Charlie Baker III, a longtime Michael Dukakis hand; Charles Campion, a former aide to Walter Mondale; and Michael Whouley, a legendary master of Election Day turnout tactics. (He is credited with helping Al Gore narrowly beat Bill Bradley in the 2000 New Hampshire primary by sending Gore, with his Secret Service motorcade, into strong Bradley areas on voting day to cause traffic jams.)\n\nThe firm was bought by British advertising giant WPP in 2006. It evolved from mostly consulting for candidates to advising other clients\u2014nonprofit groups, companies and industry groups\u2014on how to win political fights.\n\nAmong the more than 40 consultants at Dewey Square is Minyon Moore, the director of its multicultural and state and local practice, a former political aide in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House who joined the firm in 2004. Moore is close with Hillary Clinton\u2014in 2008, she asked a Washington businessman to fund a shadow pro-Clinton effort during the Democratic primaries in four states and Puerto Rico costing $608,750. Moore weathered that revelation, and it was she who organized the first meeting at Clinton\u2019s Embassy Row home in 2013 to discuss what another run for president would entail.\n\nMoore, Baker and Whouley were in the so-called working group that oversaw the Clinton campaign-in-waiting before her formal announcement. And Baker was hired as the campaign\u2019s \u201cchief administrative officer\u201d\u2014essentially, its liaison to the Democratic National Committee. If Clinton wins the nomination, Baker is expected to assume control of the party structure in 2016. Further affirming Dewey Square\u2019s influence in Hillary-land is its alum Guy Cecil, who leads the main pro-Clinton super PAC, Priorities USA.\n\nNone of the firm\u2019s known projects was as directly opposed to the Democrats\u2019 core agenda as its work on behalf of AHIP in 2007 and 2008.\n\nWhen Democrats took control of Congress after their 2006 election sweep\u2014a sweep in which Whouley played a key role in boosting turnout\u2014one of their first agenda items was to expand health insurance for low-income children. To pay for it, they proposed reining in subsidies given to insurers who offered seniors coverage under Medicare Advantage, the privately run alternative to Medicare.\n\nMedicare Advantage was created on the logic that it would increase choice and provide more efficient care. But by 2007, the plans were costing the government about $1,000 more per enrollee than traditional Medicare. Congressional budget analysts found that if the government cut payments to insurers to match those in the traditional system it could save $54 billion over five years.\n\nThat would be bad news for AHIP\u2019s members, who were relying on Medicare Advantage for an increasing share of their profits. The insurance lobby, then led by Ignagni, turned to Dewey Square.\n\nThe firm already had offered AHIP its services as a conduit to Democratic lawmakers and activists, in particular African-American and Hispanic ones, according to a person involved in the discussions. The two came up with a shrewd argument against cuts to Medicare Advantage: Minorities were especially prone to chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Since Medicare Advantage plans purported to be superior at managing those problems, the subsidy cuts, and resulting benefit cuts, would hit minorities especially hard. (In fact, enrollment levels were no higher among minorities than white retirees.)\n\nIt was an all-out effort, as described by The Wall Street Journal in 2007. Dewey Square held a briefing for black and Latino lawmakers, with the invitations sent out by a Dewey Square principal who used to be executive director of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. There, the lawmakers heard a pitch for Medicare Advantage from Aetna CEO Ronald Williams, who is African-American.\n\nThe message seemed to register with several Democratic House members, including Stephanie Tubbs-Jones, from Cleveland, who spoke up against the cuts at a House hearing, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s a program where a significant number of minority seniors have decided to place themselves.\u201d (Among the black lawmakers who weren\u2019t persuaded was Senator Barack Obama.)\n\nAHIP unveiled an advisory committee on the issue that included three dozen black, Latino and Asian-American leaders, including the former mayors of Denver and Miami. Dewey Square coaxed letters to Congress opposing the Medicare Advantage cuts out of the NAACP and the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\nThe firm even flew in from Orlando an 81-year-old Hispanic woman in a wheelchair who had had five heart attacks and three strokes to testify against the cuts, saying that her Medicare Advantage plan paid for a foot doctor to come to her house to clip her toenails to avoid diabetes complications. \u201cIt was a creative way to look at the issue that I don\u2019t think had been examined before\u2014and it did catch folks\u2019 attention on the Hill,\u201d said Dan Elling, who was a Republican health-policy staffer on the House Ways and Means Committee at the time.\n\nCongressional Democrats ended up implementing some cuts to Medicare Advantage in 2008, over President Bush\u2019s veto. But the fight arose again the next year, with higher stakes, when Obama and congressional Democrats launched their push for the Affordable Care Act, which called for additional cuts to Medicare Advantage to help pay for near-universal health coverage.\n\nThis time, AHIP\u2019s campaign included getting seniors to send letters to their local newspapers opposing the cuts\u2014a tactic that backfired when an editor at the Lawrence Eagle-Tribune, in Massachusetts, discovered that some of the people whose names were attached to the letters had no recollection of writing them. He got even more suspicious when he found that a young man who had called to make sure the letters were published was an intern at the Dewey Square Group.\n\nThe AHIP campaign didn\u2019t keep Congress from including more Medicare Advantage cuts in the final legislation. \u201cI knew they were out hustling lobbyists to work the crowd, as it were, but it didn\u2019t seem to make any difference to us,\u201d said Pete Stark, a California Democrat who chaired the health subcommittee on Ways and Means before losing his seat in 2012.\n\nBut AHIP did ultimately win important concessions. The industry limited the impact of cuts by getting the Obama administration to expand a demonstration project rewarding high-quality insurers with higher payments.\n\nWith insurers under less pressure to raise the plans\u2019 costs to enrollees or reduce their benefits, the big exodus from Medicare Advantage that AHIP had warned about never happened. In fact, enrollment has surged to nearly 17 million beneficiaries, more than a third of all Medicare enrollees.\n\nGinny Terzano, a spokeswoman for Dewey Square, said it stopped working with AHIP in 2008.\n\n\u201cThe firm tends to work with businesses and organizations that are like-minded in our policy views and values,\u201d she said. \u201cIf it becomes clear that a policy position is not in line with our thinking, we either won\u2019t take the work or we will step away from the work.\u201d\n\nShe declined to comment on how the firm\u2019s work for AHIP reflects on Clinton, given the firm\u2019s prominence in her campaign: \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at the Clinton campaign and what they think, I refer you to the Clinton campaign.\u201d\n\nA Clinton campaign spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWith Obamacare, the next occupant of the White House will preside over a continual tweaking of health-care rules and payments that will have more consequence for the insurance industry than ever. Congress and the next administration will also be facing the big decision of whether to retain an excise tax on high-cost insurance plans, which is supposed to go into effect in 2017. AHIP is already lobbying to repeal it.\n\nRichard Kirsch, the former director of Health Care for America Now, which lobbied for universal coverage, said he isn\u2019t kept awake nights by Dewey Square\u2019s connections to the insurance lobby. Just because the firm was doing the industry\u2019s bidding when it was being paid doesn\u2019t mean its principals would take up the industry\u2019s cause if they ended up in a Hillary Clinton administration, he said.\n\nKirsch said he and other policy advocates are more worried about Obama officials like Tavenner, the former Medicare and Medicaid chief, who have moved into the industry.\n\nClare Krusing, a spokeswoman for the insurance lobby, said the hiring of an Obama official as chief executive doesn\u2019t reflect a change in the group\u2019s strategy. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a shift or an evolution,\u201d she said. \u201cHow you move forward in a way that creates and delivers affordable choice for consumers has always been our focus.\u201d\n\n\n\nTo Kirsch, though, Tavenner\u2019s connections raise the prospect of unfair influence even though government ethics rules forbid her from directly lobbying the administration over the next two years.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge conflict and a great example of revolving door,\u201d Kirsch said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:15.054+0000"}

Blumenthal dives right in and informs Clinton of many important facts about Clemons\u2014including an all-important bit about his sexuality.\n\n\u201cClemons runs the foreign policy program at New America Foundation, a character around town, very busy, gossipy, gay, friend of Laurie Rubiner (from her NAF days), former moderate Republican, funded in part by Bernard Schwartz, foreign policy realist, and who began his career as a walker of Hollywood wives,\u201d Blumenthal writes.\n\nIn another exchange, Blumenthal assures Clinton there really is, quoting her famous words in the middle of the Lewinsky scandal, \u201ca vast right-wing conspiracy.\u201d The email includes Jane Mayer\u2019s 2010 New Yorker piece on the Koch brothers, which brought the libertarian billionaire siblings more national notoriety.\n\n\u201cAh, some light vacation reading!\u201d Clinton responds.\n\nIn October 2010, Blumenthal told Clinton to \u201chave a good trip building the de facto China containment alliance. Will discuss election carnage when you return.\u201d\n\nBlumenthal was also a defender of Noam Chomsky and asked Clinton to intervene when the noted far-left academic was banned from visiting Israel.\n\n\u201cYou may have been alerted to this incident: the barring of Noam Chomsky from Israel,\u201d Blumenthal writes in a May 2010 email with the subject line \u201cUS Should criticize Israel for barring Chomsky.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis political views may be ridiculous or objectionable, though he is the greatest linguistic scholar in the world, but barring him for his political opinions has created a needless PR disaster, not least for the us, as he is, after all, a US citizen, and a very prominent one internationally,\u201d Blumenthal adds. \u201cIt is unfortunate on every level. And the US should not be a passive onlooker. He is a US citizen barred for his political views, after all.\u201d\n\nThen there was the time Blumenthal aired some grievances, based on \u201cRepublican sources,\u201d about House Speaker John Boehner in an email about a potential Mitt Romney/Haley Barbour presidential ticket, an idea supposedly being pushed by Karl Rove.\n\n\u201cBoehner is despised by the younger, more conservative members of the House Republican Conference,\u201d Blumenthal writes. \u201cThey are repelled by his personal behavior. He is louche, alcoholic, lazy, and without any commitment to any principle.\u201d\n\nHe may not have liked Boehner, but Blumenthal did love him some Kathryn Bigelow, the director he saw as a sort of fill-in for Clinton. After Bigelow took home the Oscar for The Hurt Locker, Blumenthal sent Clinton an email.\n\nHe crows: \u201cMy immediate take on the Oscars is that it was Hollywood\u2019s re-voting of the 2008 primaries, not giving it to the \u2018Avatar\u2019 but to the tough woman.\u201d (Presumably Barack Obama is meant to be a blue alien in that metaphor.)\n\nBlumenthal would get pretty excited throughout these emails. In one, he celebrated the launch of American Bridge, a liberal opposition research super PAC founded by Clinton ally David Brock.\n\nWhen the PAC launched in 2010, Blumenthal sent The New York Times report to Clinton and got this gratifying answer: \u201cThat\u2019s a good launch story!

{"entityId": 1720, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Russia, ISIS, yadda yadda. The biggest existential threat to Americans is other Americans\u2014specifically, the ones armed to the teeth.\n\nWhat do you think a mother would say is the greater threat to her child: Russia or guns?\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but ask myself that question on Friday when I heard the testimony of General Joseph Dunford, President Obama\u2019s nominee to be the next Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, before the Senate Armed Services Committee. When Dunford was asked what was the greatest threat to the United States, he responded by ranking them in this order: Russia, China, North Korea, and ISIS.\n\n\n\nNow, Dunford is undoubtedly correct when it comes to the global threats facing us, and those are the threats it\u2019s his job to assess. But from a day-to-day perspective, our greatest threat, and I\u2019d submit the more pressing one, is our fellow Americans. We kill far more of each other on a daily basis than any foreign actor has come close to doing in recent years.\n\nHere are some numbers for you to consider:\n\n1. Gun Violence: Every day 30-plus Americans are murdered with guns. We are talking over 10,000 Americans killed each year by gun violence. And every single day, including today, five children or teens are murdered by someone using guns; that is 11 times more often than children are killed by gun violence in other \u201chigh income\u201d nations.\n\nIn fact, far more Americans were killed by gun violence in 2013 alone (33,636) than all the Americans killed on U.S. soil by terrorists in the last 14 years, and that\u2019s including 9/11. (2,977 Americans were killed on 9/11 and only 48 have been killed since by terrorism on U.S. soil.)\n\nFar more Americans have been killed by gun violence in 2013 alone (33,636) than all the Americans killed on U.S. soil by terrorists in the last 14 years, and that\u2019s including 9/11.\n\n2. Other Gun-Related Deaths: Apart from gun violence, another 20,000 Americans use guns to commit suicide each year. (Suicides involving firearms are fatal 85 percent of the time in contrast to about a 3 percent fatality rate when using pills.) When you combine the above numbers with the 560 people accidentally killed by guns on an annual basis, that comes out to more than 32,000 Americans who die each year by firearms. These numbers really brought it home for me: Between 2000 and 2010, 335,609 people died from guns in our country; that\u2019s more than the entire population of St. Louis, Missouri. (318,000.)\n\n\n\n3. Driving Under the Influence: Each day nearly 30 people are killed in auto accidents that involved an alcohol-impaired driver. In 2013 alone, 200 children 14 and younger were killed in crashes involving alcohol-impaired drivers.\n\n4. Domestic violence: Each day, three women are killed by their husband, boyfriend, or a person with whom they had been in a relationship. In fact, a study found that alarmingly, at least one-third of all women murdered in the United States in recent years were killed by their current or past male partners.\n\nThese killers of Americans are all distinct. There\u2019s no one remedy that will reduce the deaths in all these cases. But there is one killer that truly jumps out as the greatest existential threat to Americans: Deaths involving guns.\n\nNow I know that many on the right are preparing to regurgitate their tired talking point that this is a push to grab their guns. They are wrong. I fully support that the Second Amendment guarantees them the personal right to own firearms as recognized in the seminal 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller. (Amazing how many on the right applaud the Supreme Court when it renders decisions they like such as Heller but literally want to abolish the Supreme Court as we know it after the recent gay marriage ruling)\n\nBut how can we sit idly by as so many of our fellow Americans are killed by guns? It is as if we have collectively decided that these deaths are acceptable loses. Even after mass shootings nothing seems to change, generally due to political considerations.\n\nAnd we see politics at play again over the heartbreaking shooting death of Kate Steinle in San Francisco last week by Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, a man who was not in the country legally. Many on the right, like Donald Trump, refuse to talk about the gun aspect of this crime and solely want focus on Sanchez\u2019s immigration status because it plays to their political base. (I doubt Trump would ever mention that 70 percent of the guns recovered by the ATF in the Mexican drug war between 2007 and 2011 originated in the United States. Talk about exporting dangerous things to another country.)\n\nSo while we are confirming a new Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to protect us from global threats, isn\u2019t it time to create a federal level \u201cDepartment to prevent gun deaths\u201d to protect us from this domestic threat?\n\nThe federal government\u2019s current gun-related tasks would be unified and integrated into this new department in an effort to increase effectiveness, much the same way we saw the Department of Homeland Security bring together the responsibilities of 22 different agencies under its auspices.\n\nFor starters this new agency can ensure that the federal law barring federally licensed gun dealers from selling firearms to people convicted of crimes or with mental illnesses is fully functioning. As we learned just last week, the Charleston shooter Dylann Roof should not have been able to legally purchase a gun as he did because of his criminal record. However, a background check flaw allowed that to happen.\n\nThis new agency can also be charged with investigating gun trafficking across state lines, formulating comprehensive programs to reduce suicides by guns, and cracking down on federally licensed gun dealers that consistently sell guns used in crimes. Astoundingly, 1 percent of gun dealers account for nearly 60 percent of the guns used in crimes.\n\nWe have numerous federal agencies dedicated to keeping us safe from global threats. Isn\u2019t time we had a federal agency dedicated to protecting us from the clear and present danger posed right here in our nation by guns?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:16.379+0000"}
{"entityId": 1721, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "For a not-insignificant portion of the online right, a new form of white nationalism is taking root\u2014and it coincides with the rise of Donald Trump.\n\nThe newfangled slur \u201ccuckservative\u201d\u2014a portmanteau which combines the word\u202c \u201ccuckold\u201d (which has both sexual and racial overtones) with the word \u201cconservative\u201d\u2014has been gaining steam online these last few days.\u202c So much so that, the other day, it\u202c reached a threshold where I felt it warranted comment. So I did, and that\u2019s when the fun began.\n\nWho knows when these things reach a tipping point? But this new term\u2014typically employed in defense of Donald Trump\u2014was especially seedy. The danger is that otherwise well-meaning grassroots conservatives might mistakenly think\u202c this term, which, at best, is meant to be emasculating, was merely an\u202c anodyne synonym for RINO. Instead, it\u2019s a rallying cry for white supremacists and \u201cneoreactionaries\u201d who, for whatever reason, seem to back Trump.\n\nAt least, although I had seen it bandied about in the\u202c fever swamps of Twitter before, its mainstreaming (to the degree it has been mainstreamed) seems to have coincided with the rise of \u202c Trump as a political force. I\u2019m not suggesting he\u2019s behind it\u2014just that his comments about Mexicans being rapists might have awakened an unsavory crowd, and that they\u2019re falling for him in a major way.\n\nAnd there were two mentions by prominent\u202c conservatives that led me to believe this was about to start trending.\u202c First, on Wednesday, Rush Limbaugh averred\u202c that \u201cIf Trump were your average, ordinary, cuckolded Republican, he\u202c would have apologized by now.\u201d\n\nThe next day, conservative blogger and\u202c talk radio host Erick Erickson noticed the term, which he, to his\u202c credit, dismissed as \u201ca slur against Christian voters coined by\u202c white supremacists.\u201d\u202c\n\nIn any event, it was after posting my Daily Caller blog about this\u202c that the white supremacists came out in force. It seems that, according to several\u202c bloggers and people on Twitter (many of whom have Confederate flag\u202c avatars),\u202c by virtue of writing this piece, I had outed myself as a\u2026cuckservative. (And\u202c so had Erick Erickson for speaking out against the slur.)\n\nI also began to learn some\u202c interesting facts about who is and who isn\u2019t a cuckservative. Did you know that a Jewish conservative cannot\u202c be a cuckservative? Neither\u202c did I. Gentile support for Israel, on the other hand, is a defining\u202c trait. It turns out that supporting Israel (or immigration reform, or probably criminal justice reform) is tantamount to your wife getting pregnant by another man\u2014and then you\u202c supporting that child.\n\nIf this all sounds very base and evil and\u202c primitive, that\u2019s because it is.\n\nBut I don\u2019t want to stop with just discussing the etymology of the\u202c term, and the story of how I was personally impacted. I think it\u2019s\u202c worth digging a bit deeper and exploring why this became a \u201cthing\u201d\u2014and why it\u2019s important to confront what it represents.\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that we on the center-right have been defending ourselves and our movement against charges of racism for so long that we\u2019ve forgotten that, well, our side has some racists.\n\nThe fundamental worldview behind the slur, it seems, is one of\u202c tribalism. I suspect this is a reaction to the economic displacement and riots and\u202c chaos and the general unease and malaise that has permeated America\u202c for what seems like an eternity now. Sadly, we\u2019re seeing the rise of\u202c this on both sides of the political spectrum. And on the fringe right, we\u2019re seeing a philosophy that says whites\u202c should stick together.\u202c\n\nAs a conservative who believes in such quaint things as the rule of\u202c law\u2014and a colorblind and a pluralistic society (I know, I\u2019m such a\u202c rube!), this all disgusts me. Here\u2019s an insight into the thinking of these anti-cuckservatives, which comes from an open\u202c letter to yours truly: \u201cIt\u2019s\u202c perfectly okay for every race and ethnic group on the planet to look\u202c out for their own interests, love their own people, have their own\u202c borders (or at least wish for independent statehood), and want to\u202c perpetuate a better future for their children\u2026except Whites.\u201d\u202c\n\n\n\nAs far as I\u2019m concerned, conservative ideas are the best ideas for\u202c helping everyone flourish\u2014regardless of race or religion. But, then\u202c again, I\u2019m not a white supremacist\u2014I\u2019m a cuckservative!\u202c\n\nI also think Erickson is on to something when he talks about his\u202c faith. This kind of cynical tribalism doesn\u2019t just thrive in a world\u202c based on scarcity and fear (which is the opposite of faith), but it\u2019s\u202c also contrary to all the teachings of Christ. As a rising leader of\u202c the conservative movement, kudos to Erickson for demonstrating moral\u202c courage here.\n\nSometimes people rise to the occasion, and I think it\u2019s notable that we now have people who made their names as big RINO-hunters\u2014that is, the bloggers and pundits who made their name attacking Republican moderates and movement sellouts\u2014are now, for the first time I\u2019ve seen, actively trying to police the far right. Conservatives are waking up to the fact that the racists on our side need to be killed with fire.\n\nThe other positive thing is that, in response to this, several mainstream\u202c conservatives have begun appropriating the term, embracing\u202c it for comedic purposes, and thus, taking away the power of using it\u202c in a derogatory manner. We are all cuckservatives now.\u202c\n\nI think it\u2019s fair to say that we on the center-right have been defending ourselves and our movement against charges of racism for so long that we\u2019ve forgotten that, well, our side has some racists. \u201cThe truth is, there are always racists in the movement, or, not even in the movement, actually, as they tend to be outside of the movement, but there are racists adjacent to the movement, always hoping and pushing the conservative movement to become what they think it really should be, a champion of the White Race and Protector of Peoples of European Descent, or whatever they\u2019re calling it this week,\u201d is how the conservative blogger Ace of Spades put it last week.\n\nSo these\u202c people have always been around. But whereas they were once confined to\u202c the nether regions of the Internet, now Twitter allows them to spread\u202c their pernicious message, and Trump has given them a candidate to get behind. This might make them seem more powerful than\u202c they really are, but I do worry that this white nationalism business is starting to take off\u2014that\u202c it\u2019s not just the term \u201ccuckservative\u201d that\u2019s being mainstreamed.\n\nI\u202c fear that more people on both ends of the political spectrum are\u202c embracing what should be fringe\u202c views in America. I can\u2019t police the left, but my hope in writing this\u202c is to sound the alarm on the right. And message is simple: Be\u202c optimistic about America. Embrace our pluralistic society. And don\u2019t let these vile goddamn racists pollute our message. They are not our friends, they are not on our team, and conservative leaders must roundly condemn them.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:16.617+0000"}
{"entityId": 1722, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The firestorm Democrats created after 2012\u2019s \u201clegitimate rape\u201d claims is dead, Republican women panelists said Monday. Now the GOP just has to figure out how to win over female voters.\n\nIt was not a battle of their choosing. They wanted peace, they say. But more than two years after the first shots were fired in the \u201cwar on women,\u201d when Todd Akin mused aloud about \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d a group of conservative women say the war is over\u2014and that they won.\n\n\u201cWhat do most women do every week? Do they fill up the gas tank and the grocery cart? Or do they get an abortion?\u201d said GOP pollster Kellyanne Conway to a roomful of conservative activists and congressional staffers Monday afternoon.\n\nThe occasion was a panel discussion, \u201cWar No More, \u201d hosted by Concerned Women for America, an evangelical Christian woman\u2019s group that stands as a counter to the liberal National Organization for Women.\n\nAs Conway and her co-panelists saw it, the Democrats pulled a masterful bait-and-switch in 2012, when they hyped up comments by Akin and by Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock\u2014who said unintended pregnancies as a result of rape were \u201csomething God intended\u201d\u2014into a \u201cwar on women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe notion that we can\u2019t think about anything other than from the waist down is congenitally flawed,\u201d Conway said. This was borne out in 2014, she said, when Democrats doubled down on the war plan but suffered a series of losses, even though at least one candidate, Sen. Mark Udall of Colorado, went so heavy on the reproductive health rhetoric that one of his own campaign supporters started calling him Mark Uterus.\n\nAs far as Republicans are concerned, the sooner this particular war is over, the sooner they can begin to clear the battlefield and tend to the wounded.\n\nIn 2012, women broke for Barack Obama by 11 points. And two-thirds of unmarried women, a growing slice of the electorate, voted for the Democrat. This year, with Hillary Clinton\u2014or, as CWA president Penny Nance called her, \u201cClaire Underwood\u201d\u2014the likely Democratic nominee, the margin could widen further.\n\n\u201cThe right simply doesn\u2019t take gender differences seriously enough,\u201d said Sabrina Schaeffer, the president of the Independent Women\u2019s Forum, warning that progressives were already far ahead of conservatives on their messaging. \u201cThinking about and talking to women is not the same as pandering. It is not the same as playing gender differences.\u201d\n\nAccording to the panelists, Republicans can cut into that gap by reminding voters that no matter how bad the war on women may seem, it is not as bad as a real war.\n\n\u201cWomen are being violated at the hands of Islamic jihadists,\u201d said Nance. According to Conway, the rise of terrorism overseas helped beat back the Democratic advance in 2014.\n\nWomen then found out, she said, that \u201cISIS\u2019s idea of birth control is to eradicate Western civilization.\u201d\n\nThe other prong to the 2016 strategy is to go on offense on the abortion question. If Republicans have to answer questions about whether they believe in birth control, Democrats should have to answer questions about exactly how far their support of abortion extends. Does it extend to taxpayer-funded abortions? Sex-selective abortions? Abortions after 20 weeks?\n\n\u201cThe notion that we can\u2019t think about anything other than from the waist down is congenitally flawed.\u201d\n\nFinally, if Democrats have professed outrage at every ill-considered remark a Republican man makes, it is time for the GOP to do the same. Carly Fiorina, herself a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, showed the audience how it was done: She reminded them of the time that Sen. Joni Ernst, \u201ca sitting senator, a mother, a wife, a veteran,\u201d was called \u201cwindow dressing\u201d by EMILY\u2019s List. The audience audibly gasped.\n\nBut if conservative female political strategists want to expand the notion of women\u2019s issues to something beyond reproductive health care, they may find themselves with even more explaining to do.\n\nThe pay gap between men and women is \u201cgreatly exaggerated,\u201d according to Nance, and according to Schaeffer, a result of \u201cwomen\u2019s choices, and maybe a little bit of discrimination as well.\u201d Either way, they said, it is an issue not best redressed by Congress.\n\nInstead, the panelists, which toward the end included Cathy McMorris Rodgers, the highest-ranking Republican woman in Congress, said their task was to explain why increasing the minimum wage, expanding paid sick and family leave, and addressing the pay gap would hurt women more than it would help them.\n\nAccording to Fiorina, the key to ending the pay gap was by giving the older generation a haircut. Seniority, she said, kept people from being paid their worth.\n\nSeniority systems were the reason \u201cwe keep getting inspector general reports that say that people watching porn all day long are getting paid exactly the same as someone who works hard and does their job. And who supports the seniority system? Unions. Government bureaucracies. The constituencies that the Democrats like to protect.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the war on women may be over. Long live the war on the bureaucratic masturbators.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:16.859+0000"}

Jeb Bush, who once wrote that he had no respect for the host. And that tension highlights one of the ugliest stretches of Bush\u2019s governorship.\n\nOn June 2, 2003, a Floridian named Omar Roberts\u2014who didn\u2019t seem to have any prior relationship with the then-governor\u2014emailed Bush to praise him for a recent appearance on Sean Hannity\u2019s show. Then he raised a concern: O\u2019Reilly had been covering scandal involving Florida government entities, including the case of an autistic woman who was raped and impregnated while in state care.\n\n\u201cI would feel much better if you would just at least address these issues that O\u2019Reilly is reporting either on his show or even on another interview with his friend, Sean Hannity,\u201d continued Roberts. \u201cI think that the issues of whether or not the Florida state leadership is to blame or if everything possible is being done\u2014all need to be put to rest once and for all (or as much as possible).\u201d\n\nThen Roberts asked Bush to give him a heads-up if he ever went on the show. Bush replied to Roberts\u2019 email a few hours later.\n\n\u201cThank you for writing,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI did Sean\u2019s show because he was in state and I respect him.

She was gone for two years before authorities realized she was gone, and the head of the Florida Department of Children and Families resigned because of the scandal.\n\n\u201cI did Sean's show because he was in state and I respect him. O'Reilly on the other hand is someone who I don't respect.

The State of Florida can tell Americans exactly what happened here and arrest those responsible for criminal negligence.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo say they are investigating is simply a smokescreen, a Janet Reno tactic that is hollow and dishonest,\u201d O\u2019Reilly continued later. \u201cGive us a status report on the investigation. Chances are that Rilya Wilson is dead because nobody cared about her. Her mother cared more about drug[s], her godmother cared more about money, and the State of Florida hired inefficient and possibly criminal people to look out for foster kids. How about a little outrage over that, Jeb Bush? How about some action?\u201d\n\nIn a Jan. 13, 2003, segment, O\u2019Reilly said Bush had \u201cdone a horrible job\u201d handling the case and the department.\n\n\u201cWe need people who take it personally, who want to help the kids,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cAnd with all due respect to Governor Bush, I have not seen one iota of that.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly also criticized Bush\u2019s decision to push for a guardian for the fetus. The host discussed both issues in a May 20, 2003, segment, and had tough words for Bush.\n\n\u201cI have nothing against Jeb Bush, all right,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t\u2014you know, I know the man. I don\u2019t have anything against him. But he just can\u2019t seem to run the state vis-a-vis children and disabled people. This agency cannot perform. We have\u2014this is going on six years that this has been in chaos, and I think everybody understands the situation. It\u2019s indefensible.\u201d\n\nA few hours after the show aired, Jerry Regier, a social conservative activist who founded the Family Research Council, emailed Bush the text of an op-ed defending his decision to appoint a guardian for the fetus.\n\n\u201cI had\u2019nt seen it and I am grateful,\u201d Bush replied at 2:22 a.m. the next day [all typos sic]. \u201cI got blasted on O\u2019Reilly tonight about the rape and our inability to deal with it.\u201d\n\nYears later, O\u2019Reilly has a nuanced view of Bush\u2019s time in office.

And at the New York Post, Republican strategist Liz Mair argued that Trump\u2019s pro-mass-deportation stance was not only bad policy, but also bad politics in the Republican presidential primary.\n\nBut as quickly as Trump\u2019s detractors materialized, so did his defenders, which included groups that have been dubbed as nativist and, in some cases, flagged by the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League as out-and-out hateful.\n\nIn particular, three groups that sang Donald\u2019s praise\u2014the Center for Immigration Studies, the Foundation for American Immigration Reform, and NumbersUSA\u2014have ideological roots in a population control movement that many find detestable.\n\nMark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies told Breitbart that besides Rick Santorum, no other candidate \u201chas as sound and as well thought-through an immigration plan.\u201d FAIR spokesperson Ira Mehlman praised the plan to CNN, saying it \u201cprovides meaningful penalties for those who are not deterred [from violating the law].\u201d And NumbersUSA president Roy Beck praised Trump for questioning the value of high legal immigration levels.\n\n\u201cThey want to reduce the size of the U.S. population, and they see immigration as the key to doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important outcome of Trump's plans may be pressure for all candidates\u2014including Trump\u2014to be asked what level of legal immigration they support,\u201d he wrote on the group\u2019s site.\n\nAs The New York Times reported in 2011, all three groups share a founding father, John Tanton. Tanton, a Michigan ophthalmologist, worked to stop population growth, and looked to build a cross-ideological coalition that would bring together law-and-order right-wingers and C0 2 -conscious environmentalists to fight the overpopulation of the United States.\n\nBut the groups faced a tough PR problem when news emerged that FAIR had taken money from a racist group. And the paper notes that Tanton was a booster of the work of white supremacist Jared Taylor and supported eugenics.\n\n\u201cDo we leave it to individuals to decide that they are the intelligent ones who should have more kids?\u201d he once wrote, per the Times. \u201cAnd more troublesome, what about the less intelligent, who logically should have less. Who is going to break the bad news to them?\u201d\n\nAccording to the Anti-Defamation League, Tanton also started a group called the Society for Genetic Education and mourned that Hitler gave eugenics a bad name. The ADL said these ties give politicians cause to distance themselves from the groups Tanton helped start.\n\n\u201cA close examination of the history of the movement reveals another reason for politicians to distance themselves: key members of the anti-immigrant movement have promoted eugenics\u2013the practice of selective breeding with the aim of \u2018race betterment,\u2019 a policy practiced by the Nazis,\u201d reads a post on ADL\u2019s site.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center says the three Tanton-started groups are at \u201cthe nexus of the American nativist movement.\u201d It designated FAIR as a hate group because of \u201cits acceptance of $1.2 million from the Pioneer Fund, a group founded to promote the genes of white colonials that funds studies of race, intelligence and genetics. FAIR has also hired as key officials men who also joined white supremacist groups. It has board members who regularly write for hate publications. It promotes racist conspiracy theories about Latinos. And it has produced television programming featuring white nationalists.\u201d\n\nAll three groups have offered praise for Trump\u2019s immigration proposal, which calls for mandatory deportation of criminal undocumented immigrants and the tougher requirements for legal immigration. And some on the right say this should give conservatives pause.\n\n\u201cWhy are conservatives listening to groups who actively promote the idea that the U.S. is overpopulated, that we can\u2019t have more people in the U.S. because it causes environmental harm, that they contribute to global warming?\u201d said Alfonso Aguilar, the director of American Principles in Action\u2019s Latino Partnership, and former head of the U.S. Office of Citizenship under George W. Bush.\n\nAnd Linda Chavez\u2014president of the Becoming American Institute and chairman of the National Commission on Migrant Education under President George H.W. Bush\u2014said she wasn\u2019t surprised the groups favor Trump\u2019s policies.\n\n\u201cThese groups are radical population control groups,\u201d she said. \u201cThey want to reduce the size of the U.S. population, and they see immigration as the key to doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think many conservatives are simply ignorant of the groups\u2019 ties, ignorant of their history,\u201d she added.\n\nThe groups defend themselves, and charge that Aguilar and Chavez\u2019s criticisms amount to little more than guilt by association.\n\n\u201cPersonally, myself, I think the guy\u2019s something of a circus clown,\u201d Krikorian said of Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s a bloviating megalomaniac. Nevertheless, no one else has offered as concrete and sound an immigration proposal as Trump has, so you\u2019ve gotta give credit where credit is due.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt really is a sign of how bankrupt the supporters of mass immigration are that this is all they\u2019ve got,\u201d he added. \u201cLinda and Alfonso and the rest of them are Alinskyite conservatives.\u201d\n\nRoy Beck, president of NumbersUSA, made a similar defense.\n\n\u201cAlfonso Aguilar and other activists who are unwilling to set any limits on the number of immigrants that enter the U.S. hurl insults as a substitute for debate,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNumbersUSA is a nonpartisan organization that favors an immigration policy that includes spouses, minor children, fair share of refugees, people with extraordinary skills and gives preferential treatment to American workers and those that come here legally. Mr. Aguilar resorts to false accusations because this is not a good year to argue for his policies to help some rich people get richer.\u201d\n\nAnd Bob Dane, communications director for FAIR, said charges of nativism are \u201csimply a propaganda tool to discredit groups with whom other groups disagree.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really just a crude, transparent tactic to stop the debate,\u201d he added.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:17.220+0000"}

With her second out-of-wedlock child on the way, the one-time \u201cabstinence ambassador\u201d has shown a disregard for \u201ctraditional marriage\u201d that should offend any number of devout patisserie owners and pizzeria proprietors.\n\nThe young Palin\u2019s recent remarks defending the pregnancy as \u201cplanned\u201d are actually quite damning in that regard. She asserts, \u201cEveryone knows I wanted more kids, to have a bigger family\u201d and that she believed herself to be \u201cheading that way\u201d\u2014an oblique reference to her broken engagement to Dakota Meyer\u2014but that \u201cthings did not go according to plan.\u201d\n\nWhen everything does \u201cnot go according to plan,\u201d that usually means the result is \u201cunplanned,\u201d but here I take it that by \u201cplanned\u201d she means \u201cwanted.\u201d (If she needed the difference between \u201cplanned\u201d and \u201cwanted\u201d clarified, and maybe avoid other situations that \u201cdid not go according to plan,\u201d there\u2019s a place she could go that helpfully has \u201cplanned\u201d in its very name.)\n\nI\u2019m thrilled the baby is wanted, but Palin\u2019s own narrative, and delight in growing her family, gives lie to the line conservatives continue to push: that traditional marriage is fundamental to family. By many conservatives\u2019 definition, one 24-year-old and two kids is not a meaningful family. And, certainly, \u201cheading that way\u201d is not \u201cmarriage.\u201d Jim Obergefell could have told her that years ago.\n\nHowever flimsy they are as excuses, Palin needs to invoke \u201cheading that way\u201d and \u201chaving a family,\u201d because those are the only reasons a \u201cgood\u201d Christian can possibly give for sex before marriage. The alternatives are either unrealistic (IVF mixup? The supernatural?) or, among conservative Christians, unspeakable.\n\n\n\nJust watch this clip of Palin stiffly bantering with premature has-been Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d Sorrentino. They spend much of the minute and a half euphemizing themselves. \u201cTrust me, though, I\u2019m not getting myself into another situation,\u201d she says. \u201cI avoid situations.\u201d Welp.\n\nSo how could we possibly expect Palin now to admit a completely plausible truth: that however much she wanted a family, or believed that she would be married, she had sex before marriage because she wanted to have sex before marriage?\n\nImagine that. I mean, I\u2019m sure there\u2019s some fan fiction out there.\n\nBecause Palin says she wanted to have kids and thought she was about to get married, I imagine most of her conservative Christian brethren will be quick to forgive her. They may not even recognize her trespass as a very troubling sin. If she were to admit that she was less family-minded and more DTF, well, at least the sex was procreative. It\u2019s not like she was gay.\n\nThat gay sex is non-procreative is one of the main the reason so many Christians find it troubling. (Well, I suspect there are others, less easily brought to light.) They have created a kind of catch-22 of sin by using that argument as a reason gay people shouldn\u2019t be able to get married, and (in their minds, and Texas) eliminate the category of marriage as a possibility.\n\nIndeed, one irony of the post-Obergefell world is that, finally, unmarried gays will get to live in sin.\n\nIf she were to admit that she was less family-minded and more DTF, well, at least the sex was procreative. It\u2019s not like she was gay.\n\nSuch a designation is easy to take lightly, especially if you\u2019ve been sinning by others\u2019 definition for years, but Palin\u2019s defiant announcement reminds us that in many quarters, marriage equality will do little for how people think about LGBT people. For conservative Christians, the problem with sex will always be sex, not marriage.\n\nLGBT activists\u2019 emphasis on marriage equality has been an explicitly political choice. As Andrew Sullivan pointed out decades ago, to ask for marriage equality is an inherently conservative argument. It\u2019s also a romantic one. Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s decision was appropriately swooning and will likely be incorporated into people\u2019s wedding vows for years to come.\n\nBut I hope it\u2019s not too soon to remind people that when it comes to full equality, #lovewins is not necessarily about marriage, it\u2019s about being able to love whomever you want\u2014or to make love with whomever you want, even if you\u2019re not planning on loving them longer than a night.\n\nIn the avalanche of rainbows, it\u2019s easy to forget that marriage equality is a step toward LGBT equality, not its end goal. Full civil rights for LGBT people would mean accepting them as married couples, sure, but also accepting them as people who might have sex outside of marriage\u2014just like Bristol Palin.\n\nThe impulse to mock Palin for her predicament is well-nigh impossible to resist. Obviously, I have succumbed to it here. But we should not let the deliciousness of the irony keep us from sensing the genuine human pain that\u2019s at the center of it. Whatever her faults and hypocrisies, Palin is now single when she didn\u2019t expect to be single, and a mother in a family structure that her closest allies regard as second-best. While she likely doesn\u2019t share other single mothers\u2019 economic struggles, she faces the same emotional obstacle course of intense joy and lonely exhaustion.\n\nAfter all, what really separates conservatives and progressives in their reactions to unplanned pregnancies isn\u2019t how they feel about the pregnancy, it\u2019s how they feel about the woman carrying it. I hope Palin finds the support she needs, and I will be happy to bake her cake.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:17.483+0000"}
{"entityId": 1726, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Among Democrats, \u201creforming\u201d Social Security is so over. The keyword now is \u201cexpand.\u201d But that means a tax hike. What will Hillary do?\n\nAfter years of fending off cuts to Social Security benefits and having political courage defined as a willingness to \u201creform\u201d the program, the grassroots left is taking a new approach and calling for Social Security expansion. Given the demographics (more old people, fewer workers) and the paucity of federal resources, it seems like a fool\u2019s errand, but it\u2019s one that\u2019s in line with their party\u2019s values, and one that could lead to political gold in a presidential election where the candidates hold such contrasting views.\n\nThe current program is fiscally sound through 2033, and after that taxes have to be raised or benefits cut. Yet endorsing expansion is rapidly becoming a litmus test for Democrats. \u201cIt started out as kind of a fringe idea, just like Bush\u2019s privatization, but fringe ideas can sometimes catch on,\u201d says Jim Kessler, co-founder of Third Way, a centrist Democrat group that opposes expansion as \u201ca selfish idea\u201d that benefits wealthier people more than those at the lower end of the earnings scale, and could crowd out spending on other progressive goals.\n\nFormer Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, who is expected to challenge Hillary Clinton for the nomination and who was once a favorite of Third Way, is pushing expansion as part of his appeal to a Democratic base looking for an alternative to Elizabeth Warren, because she\u2019s not entering the race. A Warren-sponsored budget amendment to expand Social Security recently failed in the Senate but won the votes of all but two Senate Democrats. Not surprisingly, no Republicans signed on, and so far Clinton has managed to steer clear of making any kind of explicit commitment.\n\nIn today\u2019s populist environment, Clinton doesn\u2019t want to be labeled \u201cWall Street Democrat,\u201d yet she doesn\u2019t want to be pushed left beyond where she is comfortable, and she doesn\u2019t want to make promises that if elected president she\u2019d find impossible to keep. There are progressive ways to expand Social Security that wouldn\u2019t break the budget, says Paul Van de Water, with the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. For example, the payroll tax currently capped at $118,500 earnings could be re-imposed for incomes over, say, $250,000, and the benefits formula adjusted so the highest earners would get some benefit, but not a windfall, for their increased contribution.\n\nThe guessing is that Hillary Clinton, whether out of conviction or pragmatic reasons, is likely to be more progressive than Bill Clinton, who was on the verge of negotiating a deal with Republicans that would have included some privatization when the Lewinsky scandal put an end to the bipartisan grand bargain. Van de Water says from his perspective, it was one of the few good things to come out of that episode.\n\nThis is not a campaign cycle during which Democrats are going to get courage points for calling for entitlement cuts.\n\n\u201cThe appeal she has to me\u2014and I\u2019m not a big Hillary fan\u2014is she would make those choices her husband was about to make,\u201d says Steve LaTourette, president and CEO of Main Street Partnership, whose mission is to advocate for pragmatic, common-sense solutions to the country\u2019s problems. LaTourette was elected to the House in the 1994 GOP sweep and served almost 20 years representing an Ohio swing district. Social Security and the other big entitlement programs, Medicare and Medicaid, were two-thirds of the budget when he arrived, he said, and by the time he left Congress in 2013, they accounted for three-quarters of the budget.\n\nLaTourette acknowledged that \u201cWe have to do something\u201d to make the program demographically sustainable, but he was surprised when New Jersey Governor Christie proposed last week an increase in the retirement age plus means testing that would reduce and potentially eliminate benefits for high-earners. \u201cI don\u2019t know who he\u2019s appealing to with that,\u201d LaTourette said. \u201cIf it was designed to take a rightward turn, it\u2019s a little late for that. I don\u2019t think his campaign is going to catch fire.\u201d Political analysts treated Christie\u2019s surprise announcement taking on Social Security, the third rail of politics, as the equivalent of a Hail Mary pass to get back his creds in the presidential race with the conservative base.\n\nAt the least, Christie\u2019s proposal guarantees that the other GOP candidates will be questioned in the upcoming debates that get underway in August about whether they would raise the retirement age for Social Security. Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio have already said yes, insuring a bright line between the GOP and any likely Democrat. While people are living longer, studies show those gains are in the upper half of the income scale, not the bottom half, where plenty of people depend on Social Security for all or most of their income.\n\nThere is justification for expanding Social Security in a world where fewer workers are eligible for traditional pension plans and people are not putting money away for retirement. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, who last year joined a bipartisan group, the Center for Retirement Initiatives at Georgetown University, told The Daily Beast, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that we need to expand Social Security because the other options have collapsed.\u201d Townsend is considering entering the race in Maryland to replace retiring Senator Barbara Mikulski, where two announced Democrats, Chris Van Hollen and Donna Edwards, support expansion. Townsend sees the issue as far broader than Social Security, and as Robert Kennedy\u2019s eldest child, wants to be the voice of the 50 percent of Americans who lack retirement plans through their jobs.\n\nThis is not a campaign cycle during which Democrats are going to get courage points for calling for entitlement cuts. The politics have shifted, and a Democratic proposal in Congress calls for bumping up the payroll tax from 6.2 to 7.2 percent over time to pay for expanding Social Security. \u201cIt seems benign,\u201d says Third Way\u2019s Kessler. \u201cWho could be against it? But if you sign on to it somebody will notice there\u2019s a huge tax increase attached to it. It\u2019s not going to hurt Democrats in the primary, but in the general election, no matter what office you\u2019re running for it\u2019s going to hurt politically.\u201d Maybe so, but in the Warren wing of the Democratic Party, happy days are here again.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:17.751+0000"}
{"entityId": 1727, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "So why isn\u2019t that Muslims flight attendant who refused to serve liquor on a flight a martyr to religious freedom? I think we know.\n\nMike Huckabee and Ted Cruz are outraged over the \u201cpersecution\u201d of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis over her Christian beliefs. The war on religious liberty is in full swing per this dynamic duo. But we don\u2019t hear a peep from these two self-appointed defenders of religious liberty in the case of a Muslim American flight attendant who was suspended from her job two weeks ago for not wanting to serve alcoholic drinks in violation of her faith.\n\nDo you think Huckabee and Cruz stand up for \u201creligious liberty\u201d only when it helps their quest for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination? Or do they not believe that Muslims are entitled to religious liberty? Possibly it\u2019s a little of both.\n\nNow just so it\u2019s clear, from a legal point of view, the cases of the Muslim American flight attendant, Charee Stanley, and Davis are completely different. Davis is an elected official who not only refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, she also prohibited five other clerks in her office from issuing marriage licenses even though they had no religious objections. Her actions prevented the local government agency from fulfilling one of its primary responsibilities.\n\nIn Stanley\u2019s case, she was not seeking to prevent the airline from serving alcohol to all passengers on flights she worked. Rather, Stanley, who had been hired three years ago by Atlanta-based airline carrier Express Jet, asked her employer if other flight attendants could serve alcoholic drinks to passengers instead of her because it violated her religious beliefs. As New York City\u2019s Imam Shamsi Ali explained, not only is drinking alcohol a sin to Muslims, \u201chelping others drink alcohol is a sin itself.\u201d Ali did note there are some Islamic scholars who believe it\u2019s permissible to serve alcohol if it\u2019s an obligation of your job.\n\nThe coworker\u2019s complaint also spoke of concerns about Stanley wearing a Muslim headdress (hijab) and reading books with \u201cforeign writings,\u201d which may give you a better sense of what is at play here.\n\nSo what happens when your religious beliefs and your job responsibilities collide? Then you do exactly what Stanley did and ask your employer for a \u201creligious accommodation,\u201d which is guaranteed to employees under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This federal statute requires employers covered by the law, like Express Jet, to \u201creasonably accommodate an employee\u2019s religious beliefs or practices, unless doing so would cause more than a minimal burden on\u201d the operation of the business.\n\nIn fact, Express Jet agreed in June to the accommodation that Stanley proposed, and all was working well. That is until last month when a coworker filed a complaint alleging that Stanley was not fulfilling her job responsibilities because she would not serve alcohol. The coworker\u2019s complaint also spoke of concerns about Stanley wearing a Muslim headdress (hijab) and reading books with \u201cforeign writings,\u201d which may give you a better sense of what is at play here.\n\nOn August 24, Express Jet formally notified Stanley that it was revoking the religious accommodation it had granted and placed her on administrative leave as precursor to terminating her employment. Consequently, Stanley filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) with the help of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations.\n\nThe legal question in this matter is simple: Is Stanley\u2019s proposed religious accommodation of having another flight attendant serve passengers alcohol imposing an \u201cundue hardship\u201d upon Express Jet, a midsize company with 8,500 employees that flies to 179 airports? If the burden on the company is only minimal (in terms of money and/or operationally), the court will, in all likelihood, order the employer to offer the employee a reasonable religious accommodation.\n\nIn Stanley\u2019s case, simply having another flight attendant serve alcohol appears to be as minimal as you can get. It would be no different than not requiring a Christian pharmacist to personally dispense birth control pills if it violated their religious beliefs and instead having other employees do that. In fact, that very scenario is one of the examples given by the EEOC in its guidelines for employers on when they should grant a \u201creligious accommodation.\u201d\n\nHuckabee and Cruz not showing any concern for a Muslim trying to defend her religious liberty is not surprising to me. We all understand politics. What was more surprising was the reaction of many Muslim Americans to this issue when I asked for their views on social media.\n\nI received nearly 100 responses that spanned the gambit. There was the unsurprising, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t take a job that compromises my religious values in the first place\u201d reaction. The more unexpected response, however, was the large number of Muslim American who said in essence: \u201cIf it was part of my job description, I would serve it. They\u2019re not asking me to drink it!\u201d\n\nAnd then there were some in the middle who had worked out their own accommodations at the workplace. For example, one person who commented, \u201cWhen I was in the U.S. Army, part of my job in the kitchen was serving food. I told my sergeant that I couldn\u2019t serve pork. He simply moved me to a job in the kitchen were I didn\u2019t have to serve pork.\u201d\n\nAnd some Muslims responded that they drank alcohol, so who cares about serving it.\n\nSometimes I even forget the wide range of views in my community from progressive to conservative to even the growing number of Muslims whose connection to Islam is more cultural than religious.\n\nAt this point, Kim Davis is free from jail, and a de facto religious accommodation has been found: She will not have to issue marriage licenses, but her deputy clerks who don\u2019t have a religious objection will. Perhaps Stanley will have her religious liberty protected as well. As Stanley\u2019s lawyer, Lena Masri, pointed out to me, \u201cThe importance of ensuring accommodations for one religious group ensures rights are protected across all faith groups.\u201d I can only hope that Christians like Huckabee and Cruz believed the same thing.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:18.269+0000"}

There are pins, stickers, and beer-cozies featuring a blue and red \u201cMARTIN O MALLEY\u201d logo piled on a table at Margaritas.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the swag, O\u2019Malley has gone from avoiding talk about the Clintons to directly (ish) challenging their dominance over the Democratic nomination.\n\nBut first, a song.\n\nO\u2019Malley lingers in front of the crowd at Margaritas, teasing them into thinking there is any chance in hell that he is not going to pick up the guitar and sing. \u201cI don\u2019t know, they\u2019re all breaking up,\u201d he jokes as he watches a few people disband to the back of the room where margaritas are being served. \u201cMaybe they just want to go back to the bar!\u201d\n\nHe gives up, lifts up the guitar, it\u2019s red strap decorated with yellow suns, and strums. \u201cSing it with me!\u201d\n\nHe begins softly crooning Woody Guthrie\u2019s This Land is Your Land, his right foot tapping along to the pleasant tone of his voice.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of examples where, in our party, there was an inevitable frontrunner right up until the first contest, and then, suddenly the country says, \u2018Oh my goodness, the frontrunner wasn\u2019t inevitable,\u2019 and there\u2019s a challenger none of us has ever heard of.\u201d\n\nAs O\u2019Malley sings, his eyes remain wide open. His steely, unbreakable gaze communicates a desperation that makes the performance feel like an audition for a version of American Idol wherein the winner receives the presidency rather than a recording contract.\n\nIt\u2019s unsettling\u2026To me anyway, but maybe not to the rest of the crowd. They eventually join him, whisper-singing in eerie unison.\n\nNobody living can ever stop me\n\nAs I go walking that freedom highway\n\nNobody living can ever make me turn back\n\nThis land was made for you and me\n\nO\u2019Malley is 52 years old, of average height, with grey hair styled in the back to conceal an emerging bald spot. He is exceedingly charming, but flashes a smile so pleasant it verges on menacing.\n\nHe grew up in a political family (his parents met working on a Young Democrats newsletter in 1954 and first entered politics in 1982 as a \u201cyoung college student,\u201d he said, at Catholic University, when he took a semester off to volunteer for Gary Hart.\n\nThat experience, he told me, allowed him to \u201csee how open our political process really is as a nation.\u201d\n\nHe needs that to be true now more than ever.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s first campaign was for Maryland State Senate in 1990. He lost.\n\nThe following year, he was elected to the Baltimore City Council, where he remained until he ran for mayor in 1999.\n\nHe was elected in a landslide.\n\nAfter that election, O\u2019Malley said Bill Clinton, \u201cvery kindly called me.\u201d O\u2019Malley smiled recounting the conversation to me.\n\n\u201cHow does somebody get 91 percent?\u201d the president asked him.\n\n\u201cThe goodness of the people I serve,\u201d O\u2019Malley told Clinton.\n\nBack then, O\u2019Malley governed as Clinton-style New Democrat who labored to make government more efficient. As mayor and then governor, O\u2019Malley relied on statistics to measure the effectiveness of government programs. He adopted the model from CompStat, a system created by the late Jack Maple, the Deputy Police Commissioner for Crime Control Strategies in New York City, which helped to dramatically lower crime rates.\n\nO\u2019Malley and Maple grew close, and broadened the use of CompStat to tackle problems other than crime.\n\nO\u2019Malley considers the successes of his data-based programs to be his most important legacy, although, he admitted, \u201cthis is not something that I would roll out at a firefighters convention to get people on their feet.\u201d\n\nHis wonky centrism made him a natural ally of the Clintons. O\u2019Malley told me he has maintained a \u201ccordial, friendly, and respectful relationship\u201d with Bill and Hillary, who both endorsed him for governor in 2006. He returned the favor by endorsing Hillary in 2008 when she ran for president. O\u2019Malley eagerly pointed out he was one of the only Democratic governors to stand by her side until the very end of the primaries.\n\nBack at Margaritas, O\u2019Malley finished his one-song set and I followed him to a table upstairs. He was on his third Corona, and the lime was stuck in the neck of the bottle. He tapped it on the table but couldn\u2019t dislodge it, so he finally poked his index finger into the bottle. He rewarded himself with a long sip and a tortilla chip. He unbuttoned the third button on his white dress shirt, grabbed the end of his blue tie, and tucked it inside the shirt.\n\nBesides the guitar, O\u2019Malley plays the Bodhran, an Irish drum, the tin whistle, the harmonica, the banjo and, briefly, the Irish bagpipe. He joined his first band, the Shannon Tide, when he was 17.\n\n\u201cIn D.C. there were kind of seven Irish bars and only three Irish bands. We weren\u2019t very good, but they paid us to do the same 10 to 20 songs everyday.\u201d Eventually his band moved on and he went solo before forming O\u2019Malley\u2019s March.\n\n\u201cWe mostly do Irish stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we toss in Johnny Cash, songs of the Chesapeake and stuff I\u2019ve written.\u201d His favorite Cash song, he said, after joking that the question was \u201clike a foreign policy question,\u201d is I Walk the Line.\n\nThe music thing, he said, is no gimmick: \u201cI found when I was running for mayor that the music was a bit of an international language and a way to break down sort of the power-distance bullshit that people sense between their candidates or elected leaders and themselves.\u201d\n\nBut the guitar-playing has also become a campaign schtick.\n\nHis aides sometimes like to pretend the performances are unplanned, as if guitars just somehow keep finding O\u2019Malley while he\u2019s out on the road. Ahead of the the Margarita\u2019s event, Lis Smith, O\u2019Malley\u2019s spokesperson, told me that having a guitar on hand was her idea, but her boss had no clue it would be there. \u201cI\u2019m not bullshitting you \u2013 he doesn\u2019t know!\u201d she said.\n\nBut Howell \u201cHuck\u201d Montgomery, a Democratic operative and self-described (on Twitter) \u201c#NHpolitics junkie\u201d told me the guitar was the doing of his girlfriend, who works with the Young Dems. \u201cIt\u2019s her guitar and she said, \u2018Oh well, maybe you should bring it and he will play.\u2019\u201d\n\nO\u2019Malley told me he is \u201cmore comfortable singing\u201d than speaking to crowds, which turned the conversation to the obvious: why the hell is he here in Nashua, upstairs at this decaying Mexican restaurant \u2013 which is located on top of train tracks \u2013 telling college kids and little old ladies about what he wants for America\u2019s future?\n\n\u201cAnyone running for the sacred trust and the awesome responsibility of wielding the power of the president of the United States on behalf of the people of the United States needs to earn that trust,\u201d he said, chewing his tortilla chip. \u201cSo the presidency of the United States is not a crown to be passed between two families. It is a sacred and awesome trust to be earned.\u201d\n\nBy comparing the Bushes and Clintons to royalty, O\u2019Malley said, he was articulating \u201cthe same sentiment that everyone in the country feels.\u201d\n\nWhen I mentioned Hillary by name, O\u2019Malley stared into my eyes in the same slightly disturbing and mesmerizing way he looked out at the crowd while he performed. \u201cI know that we are a country of 319 million people,\u201d he said, \u201cand it would be an extreme poverty indeed if only one was willing to compete for the Democratic nomination of the president of the United States. That\u2019s what I know.\u201d\n\nAt the end of his tenure as governor, O\u2019Malley, like many liberal activists, moved further left. He ended the death penalty, gave driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants, legalized gay marriage and began articulating a populist economic message like that of Elizabeth Warren, which may serve as a condolence of sorts to her supporters if she does not, as she has repeatedly said she will not, launch a campaign.\n\nThese resume items are no doubt what O\u2019Malley will campaign on, but he was more jazzed when discussing CitiStat and StateStat, and his dreams of leading a statistics-driven country.\n\nWhen I asked what he might call a similar system if he were in a position to implement one nationally, he answered immediately, as if it were something he considers frequently: \u201cFedStat.\u201d\n\nHow would it work? He picked up a bottle of Tapatio hot sauce and moved it into the center of the table. Then he moved the salt, his empty Corona, and the tortilla chips. He arranged them \u2013 the various factions of the federal government, for our purposes \u2013 just so. He knew exactly what he was doing.\n\nO\u2019Malley is not shy about wanting to be president. I wondered if he ever considered what types of people run for this office \u2013 who they are, what drives them \u2013 he joked \u201cuh yeah, like everyday.\u201d\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:18.620+0000"}

The Times says that\u2019s pure paranoia.\n\nDoes The New York Times harbor an institutional bias against the Clintons, prompting the country\u2019s most influential newspaper to accentuate the negative and minimize the positive in portraying one of America\u2019s more powerful political families?\n\nOf course not, says Times Executive Editor Dean Baquet.\n\n\u201cIf you look at this reasonably, there is no institutional animus toward the Clintons. I don\u2019t buy it,\u201d Baquet told The Daily Beast. \u201cI say this with all due respect to the Clintons, but politicians as a rule like to deflect criticism by blaming the press.\u201d\n\nYet it is a remarkably durable accusation, going back at least to the early 1990s, when Times investigative reporter Jeff Gerth\u2014at the behest of then-Washington bureau chief Howell Raines\u2014uncorked his much-debated 1992 \u201cWhitewater\u201d opus, an exhaustive account of ethically problematic real estate and business dealings that ultimately led, after many improbable twists and turns, to a criminal referral, an independent counsel, and President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment.\n\nRaines, who was named the Times\u2019s editorial page editor as the Clinton administration began in 1993, subsequently unleashed a torrent of scorching commentaries against the president and his activist-wife over the next eight years.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody claim anything to the contrary?\u201d demanded fierce Hillary Clinton defender James Carville, the longtime family friend and strategist who steered Bill Clinton to victory in 1992.\n\nThe late Times columnist William Safire, a former Richard Nixon speechwriter who famously called the first lady \u201ca congenital liar,\u201d also figures prominently in the pro-Clinton narrative. It claims Safire held special sway with Times publisher Arthur O. Sulzberger Jr. and, after independent counsel Ken Starr indicated in February 1997 that he was quitting the Clinton investigation to become dean of Pepperdine University Law School in Malibu, browbeat Starr into staying on and continuing to pursue his quarry.\n\nMonica Lewinsky soon became globally infamous.\n\nNearly two decades later, diehard Clinton loyalists are reviving the anti-Times charge with a vengeance now that Hillary Rodham Clinton is the frontrunner in the Democratic nomination race\u2014and The Times is subjecting the candidate to withering (occasionally flawed) scrutiny for her email practices, the sticky foreign entanglements of the Clinton family foundation, and other supposed vulnerabilities.\n\nTuesday\u2019s Times report about right-wing guerrilla videographer James O\u2019Keefe allegedly catching two senior Clinton staffers accepting an illegal campaign donation from a foreigner will do nothing to disabuse the Clintonites of their enmity.\n\n\u201cDoes anybody claim anything to the contrary?\u201d demanded fierce Hillary Clinton defender James Carville, the longtime family friend and strategist who steered Bill Clinton to victory in 1992, referring to the Times\u2019s perceived prejudice. \u201cIs there a sane person who says, \u2018No, they don\u2019t\u2019? It\u2019s like people claiming there\u2019s no climate change. You can find somebody, but it would be very hard to find somebody who doesn\u2019t work there.\u201d\n\nIn a highly unusual July 28 open letter to Baquet, more than 2,000 words long and posted on the campaign website, Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri went on the attack, complaining bitterly about the paper\u2019s \u201capparent abandonment of standard journalistic practices\u201d in covering an official government inquiry into the candidate\u2019s use of a private email server while working as secretary of state.\n\nAs Public Editor Margaret Sullivan acknowledged in a searing recap of the fiasco, The Times\u2019s handling of the above-the-fold, front-page blockbuster \u201cwas, to put it mildly, a mess\u201d\u2014initially suggesting that Clinton was the focus of a criminal referral to the Justice Department before changing the story, without alerting readers, to reflect that, no, she wasn\u2019t being targeted and it was a \u201csecurity,\u201d not a criminal, inquiry concerning the State Department\u2019s email management procedures.\n\n\u201cI think we made a mistake and they called us on it,\u201d Baquet said about Palmieri\u2019s letter. \u201cI think we did what good news organizations do. We corrected it, we wrote an editor\u2019s note, I publicly said it was a mistake to the public editor. I said it to Jen Palmieri, and I said it to everybody who asked. It\u2019s a mistake.\u201d\n\nDefending the Times\u2019s overall coverage of candidate Clinton as \u201cfair,\u201d Baquet added: \u201cI think if you did an anthropological study of how we made the mistake, the mistake had nothing to do with the Clintons. The mistake had to do with some sloppiness on deadline.\u201d\n\nYet some Clintonites remain deeply suspicious of The Times; the Clintons themselves don\u2019t bother to conceal their resentment of the paper, both claiming inaccurately in their respective autobiographies, My Life (Bill) and Living History (Hillary) that The Times either completely ignored an official 1995 report backing their account of losing money in the Whitewater mess (Bill) or devoted only \u201ca few paragraphs\u201d to it (Hillary), while the paper actually published four different stories\u2014one more than 1,700 words long.\n\nClinton ally Joe Conason, editor of the liberal-leaning National Memo website and co-author of an e-book, The Hunting of Hillary, told The Daily Beast: \u201cYou have to think there\u2019s some institutional imperative at work\u2026 Having screwed up something like Whitewater as badly as they did, they think, \u2018We\u2019re going to show what these people [the Clintons] are like\u2014they\u2019re full of conflicts, of self-serving deals, cutting corners, and now we have opportunities to show that and we\u2019re going to get those stories, write them, and go after them.\u2019\u201d\n\nGerth and Raines reject Conason\u2019s assertion that The Times \u201cscrewed up\u201d the Whitewater story, and Raines calls his former Washington bureau staffer\u2014a Pulitzer Prize-winner who left The Times in 2006 and currently works for ProPublica\u2014\u201cone of the best investigative reporters ever.\u201d\n\nGerth, who also broke the story of Hillary Clinton\u2019s $1,000 investment that miraculously grew to $100,000 by trading cattle futures, resulting in the first lady\u2019s famous \u201cPink Press Conference\u201d\u2014emailed: \u201cThe stories I did more than two decades ago, on Whitewater and the commodity trades by Mrs. Clinton, speak for themselves and have stood the test of time.\u201d\n\nThe same year that he wrote those stories about the Clintons, Gerth published critical exposes on Vice President Dan Quayle\u2019s privileged draft record and the rewarding business deals of President George H.W. Bush\u2019s family members.\n\nBut longtime Clinton sympathizer Gene Lyons\u2014Conason\u2019s co-author as well as a columnist for The Arkansas Times and the National Memo\u2014emailed: \u201cI think it\u2019s abundantly clear that the NYT has some kind of institutional Jones against both Clintons, and pretty much has ever since they came on the national scene. A lot of people in Arkansas think it has to do with simple snobbery about Bill Clinton\u2019s origins. Others speculate that Howell Raines saw him as a rival. I have no idea.\u201d\n\nRaines, who served briefly as executive editor and left The Times 12 years ago amid the Jayson Blair scandal, retorted: \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely false and indeed paranoid to think that the institution is hard-wired against the Clintons and, frankly, to trace it back to me.\u201d\n\nThe Alabama-born Raines, who while working in The Times\u2019s Atlanta bureau wrote an admiring front-page trend story touting Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton as a progressive New South politician, also dismissed another popular Clintonite theory\u2014that, as a fellow Southerner of the same generation, \u201cI was jealous of his success. But I thought I\u2019d had a pretty good career at that time.\u201d\n\nAnother popular Clintonite theory\u2014\u201cpeddled by [former Washington Post reporter and Clinton White House aide] Sidney Blumenthal in Washington and New York,\u201d according to Raines\u2014is that The Times has long been trying to redeem itself with Clinton scandal coverage after the institutionally traumatizing humiliation of being beaten by The Post on the Watergate scandal. Blumenthal declined to comment for this article.\n\nRaines recalled that his first tough editorial concerning the Clinton presidency didn\u2019t appear until several months into the first term, when President Clinton, deferring to then-Speaker of the House Tom Foley, broke an election-year promise to push campaign finance reform.\n\nLyons, meanwhile, added: \u201cGiven the NYT Washington Bureau\u2019s general performance since 1992, when I started really paying attention, I\u2019ve sometimes wondered if it hasn\u2019t fallen into the hands of a succession of ambitious sociopaths.\u201d\n\nIn the Clinton cosmology, current Times Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan\u2014who didn\u2019t respond to messages seeking comment\u2014is, if not a sociopath, certainly ambitious.\n\nConason, in a recent column, attacked Ryan\u2014\u201cwhose personal hostility to [Hillary] Clinton is widely known in the capital,\u201d he claimed without offering evidence\u2014for bragging to Public Editor Sullivan that the paper\u2019s \u201cextraordinary and world-beating [campaign] coverage,\u201d as Ryan put it, had been featured on the conservative-leaning Drudge Report, among other sites.\n\n\u201cIs a blurb on Drudge the standard by which we are now to judge the New York Times?\u201d Conason wrote. \u201cSomewhere the paper\u2019s late, great journalists are whirling in their graves at warp speed.\u201d\n\nConason and others said certain unidentified Times reporters have privately expressed concern about the Washington bureau chief\u2019s championing of aggressive, occasionally damaging reporting about the Democratic frontrunner, especially the recent stories about the candidate\u2019s private email server, bylined by Michael Schmidt\u2014another favorite target of the Clintonites\u2014who co-authored the July 23 front-page story that erroneously suggested, before a series of embarrassing corrections and an agonizing bout of Times self-reflection, that Hillary Clinton was the focus of a criminal investigation.\n\nA second Clinton ally, who declined to be quoted by name, described the paper as \u201ca house divided\u201d over Ryan\u2019s leadership of the bureau. Carville, for one, told The Daily Beast: \u201cI do not know the woman, but it is certainly true that Ms. Ryan internally is quite a polarizing figure, I think it\u2019s safe to say.\u201d\n\nBaquet, a staunch defender of Ryan, fired back: \u201cWhat I would say to my fellow Louisianan, James Carville, is that, being a pundit, he likes to opine about things when he doesn\u2019t know anything about them. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s ridiculous. Politicians are always looking for some subterranean reason why people want to go after their candidate.\u201d\n\nBaquet makes no apologies for The Times\u2019s exhaustive and sometimes critical coverage of candidate Clinton, including this August 31 Page A15 report on her freshly released emails from the State Department.\n\n\u201cThe Clintons have been in the public spotlight for a long, long, long time, and there\u2019s bound to have been some investigative reporting that they don\u2019t like during that period,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIf you look at the campaign, now she is the Democratic frontrunner in a small field of Democrats\u2014and the Republicans have a ginormous field. And if you look at the way coverage works, she is going to get more attention\u2026 She also has a long, long, complex record to be scrutinized.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s public career as first lady, New York senator, 2008 presidential candidate and secretary of state, Baquet said, \u201cbegs for a tremendous amount of scrutiny and questioning.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:19.250+0000"}

He has invested between $100,001 and $250,000 in gold\u2014which may explain the gilded everything.\n\nOf his 14 books, Time to Get Tough published around the time he was considering his presidential bid in 2001, made the most money. The royalties totaled between $50,001 and $100,000.\n\nHe also made $11,819 for his work at Trump University, a now defunct for-profit school that was successfully sued by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman late last year for breaking education licensing laws. Schneiderman sued on behalf of more than 5,000 former students who did not get the \u201cIvy League-quality\u201d education in getting rich that the school promised.\n\n\u201cIt is undisputed that Mr. Trump never complied with the licensing requirements,\u201d Judge Cynthia Kern said in her ruling.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s made money selling water ($280,185 from Trump Ice LLC), from pageants ( $3.4 million from Miss Universe) and even an ice skating rink ($8.6 million from Wollman Rink Operations\u2014an operating agreement with NYC Parks and Rec).\u201d\n\nIn 2010, the school changed its name to the Trump Entrepreneurship Initiative after New York\u2019s Education Department ruled that it was not, in fact, a university.

At ACN\u2014a slightly sketchy multilevel marketing organization that has been sued unsuccessfully in multiple states for alleged illegal practices\u2014Trump made $1,350,000 from three speeches, or $450,000 a speech.\n\nOther groups paid him between $50,000 and $150,000 for speeches.\n\nBased on the filings, The Wall Street Journal estimated Trump\u2019s net worth to be at least $1.5 billion. His liabilities total at least $265 million.\n\nSpeculation over his wealth has followed a similar pattern over the years that goes something like this: Trump claims he\u2019s worth an astronomical sum, someone famous makes fun of him and/or writes it isn\u2019t true, and he sues.\n\nDespite his wealth, Trump still draws a pension from the Screen Actors Guild totaling $110,228.

But for all the New York Times talk about \u201cWhen Liberals Blew It,\u201d as Nicholas Kristof boldly put it, liberals\u2014and most Americans\u2014are still blowing it. Until we confront the modern confusion between liberalism and libertinism, Moynihan\u2019s true warnings will go unheeded, and American society will continue degenerating.\n\nIn 1965, as Lyndon Johnson\u2019s War on Poverty gained momentum, Moynihan, a 38-year-old Assistant Secretary of Labor, boldly warned about the epidemic of illegitimate African-American births. The \u201cdeterioration of the Negro family\u201d ensnared blacks in a \u201ctangle of pathology.\u201d\n\nAnticipating the next half-century of social tensions, Moynihan noted that establishing legal rights was not enough, the challenge was ensuring equal opportunity. \u201cThe most difficult fact for white Americans to understand,\u201d he wrote, was that economically and even socially \u201cthe circumstances of the Negro American community in recent years has probably been getting worse, not better.\u201d The once stable black families of the 1950s disintegrated, as the same openness that boosted the civil rights movement also undermined traditional family structure for blacks and whites, weakening community structures and strictures.\n\nBy 1990, the percentage of black children born to unmarried mothers hit 70 percent. Thanks to this all-American values breakdown, with sexual expression trumping traditional repression, today, over 40 percent of all American births are to unmarried mothers. Many of the 50th anniversary pieces have noted that, while any particular family configuration can work, collectively, the key variable separating America\u2019s privileged and troubled kids is whether they are raised in two-parent families or single-mother households.\n\nMost Moynihan Report anniversary discussions have gone this far, contrasting the ugly accusations calling Moynihan racist with modern studies validating the warm, supportive traditional family\u2014once-conventional wisdom now grudgingly accepted only because data confirms it.\n\nModern liberalism remains too entwined with media-fueled, and now Internet-operated, nihilism.\n\nHowever, Moynihan\u2019s Report\u2014and his vision\u2014went further. Especially after enduring the backlash, Moynihan feared for liberalism\u2019s future. The New Deal-based, rational, problem-solving liberalism he believed in had spawned a fanatic, self-righteous, nihilistic, and libertine identity-driven aberration.\n\nAs the 1960s spun out of control yet went mainstream, Moynihan soured on the New Left. Internationally, the \u201ctotalitarian-left\u201d privileged non-white, non-Western dictators\u2019 whims over democrats. Domestically, \u201cthe liberal-left\u201d simply privileged individual whims, emphasizing rights not responsibilities, indulging impulses rather than fostering order. Moynihan would remain a liberal, serving as New York\u2019s Senator from 1977 until 2001. But he would continue combatting the Far Left\u2019s licentiousness and unruliness until his death on March 26, 2003, ten days after his 76th birthday.\n\nThe sexual revolution and its attendant earthquake in values galloped along with the civil rights and feminist revolutions. In this modernizing mishmash, it was hard to sift the beneficial from the harmful. Many liberals concluded that the admirable moral codes of yesteryear were too entangled with its racism, sexism, and suffocating conformism to save.\n\nAlas, this cultural hurricane was socially devastating. Moynihan\u2019s worst fears became common phenomena. His \u201ctangle of pathology\u201d entwined both blacks and whites. \u201cBroken families\u201d became mainstreamed along with the troubles they spawned, including the Great American Crime wave, the breakdown of public schools, and the if-it-feels-good-do-it culture.\n\nThe 1960s\u2019 cultural, social, and political wildness triggered Ronald Reagan\u2019s counter-revolution. By 1981, despite the \u201cCulture War\u201d talk, Republicans indulged in the sexual revolution\u2019s forbidden fruits as much as Democrats. Reagan himself was the first divorced president, with a famously dysfunctional family. Reagan\u2019s ally William Bennett reconciled Republican rhetoric and behavior by endorsing \u201cconstructive hypocrisy,\u201d appreciating the value of having standards even if you deviated from them. Consumerism, materialism, individualism, entrepreneurship, the antigovernment impulse, the information age, capitalism itself, helped dissolve traditional sensibilities, fostering an American hedonism. Reaganites never acknowledged how much their own ideology undermined the very traditions they tried preserving.\n\nBy the 1980s, some liberals started resisting the lure of licentiousness. Communitarian thinkers including George Washington University\u2019s Amitai Etzioni and Harvard\u2019s Michael Sandel resurrected a liberalism fostering traditional community, not just individual autonomy. What became \u201cThird Way\u201d Democratic politicians founded the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) to save liberalism from itself, celebrating community, opportunity, and responsibility.\n\nBy 1993, mourning the \u201cmanifest decline of the American civic order\u201d Moynihan complained in The American Scholar that Americans were \u201cdefining deviancy down.\u201d When mobsters killed seven gangsters in Chicago, it so offended American sensibilities of 1929 it became the legendary St. Valentine\u2019s Day Massacre. Now, the criminologist James Q. Wilson said Los Angeles suffered an \u201cequivalent every weekend.\u201d Despite such assaults, \u201cour response is curiously passive,\u201d Moynihan mourned. We were accepting the unacceptable.\n\nWhile fighting this libertine liberalism and its consequences, Moynihan did not just blame American culture. He pushed for innovative programs, including his pet initiative to limit gun-related murders by limiting ammunition. Moynihan mocked the NRA by saying, \u201cGuns don\u2019t kill people, bullets do.\u201d\n\nWhen the DLC\u2019s poster child, Bill Clinton, became president, hoping to renew America with a new balance, rooted in tradition and family values while celebrating progress and pluralism. Yes, Clinton compartmentalized, distinguishing between what he believed was best for America and how he actually behaved, but when addressing 5,000 African-American preachers in Memphis, Tennessee, the new president championed \u201cchanges we can make from the outside in\u201d\u2014government programs\u2014buttressed by \u201cchanges we\u2019re going to have to make from the inside out, or the others won\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nDespite his own character flaws, and despite testy relations with Moynihan, Clinton pushed hard for the drops in crime, drug use, premarital sex, divorce, and abortion that have led to today\u2019s old-new conclusions frowning on such behaviors, especially at epidemic levels. Yet, as the partial embrace this month of the Moynihan Report reflects, Americans, especially mainstream media types and leading intellectuals, still fear embracing old fashioned morality out of fear of endorsing the fundamentalist, Reaganite, racist-sexist agenda. As a result, the moral reformation America and modern liberalism still need has proceeded fitfully.\n\nEvery day the media burlesque spotlights an American with too much binge-drinking, drug abuse, sexual violence, family breakdown, celebrity worship, and psychic pain. America\u2019s soul hurts partially because we lack moral anchors in our new, ultra-liberal and libertine Republic of Nothing. Modern liberalism remains too entwined with media-fueled, and now Internet-operated, nihilism. Millions of us, and some of our leading thinkers, may have started rediscovering the value of tradition, but have yet to embrace the traditional values that anchored and guided our parents and grandparents\u2014or a valuable new tradition.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:19.724+0000"}

The state is already suffering from climate change\u2014the president needs to be an advocate for the Arctic.\n\nAlaska is a different sort of state. It is isolated from the Lower 48, but as home to some of the most crucial ecosystems of our planet, Alaska has a deep-seated connection with nature that makes us unique. It is because of Alaska that the United States is considered an Arctic Nation, so indeed; the Arctic connects us all.\n\nWhich is why President Obama\u2019s visit here is such a big deal. Not only because we\u2019re often overlooked by politicians who focus on the Lower 48, but also because we\u2019re on the front lines of climate change. Unsurprisingly, as an Arctic state, warming is hitting us hard. Whether it\u2019s the deficit of water in the summer as less snow falls over winter, resulting in record-breaking wildfires, or the shifting of the very ground below our feet as permafrost melts, Alaska is a state with perhaps the most to lose from rising temperatures.\n\nThe changes are happening at an alarming rate, but even beyond the practical concerns of infrastructure at risk from the melt or water worries, Alaska\u2019s climate carries real meaning for its people. As Gwich\u2019in Athabascan women and mothers we carry with us the responsibility to maintain our vibrant culture for our children and our children\u2019s children. In order for this to happen we need healthy lands, waters, and intact ecosystems to be protected. For those of us living a subsistence lifestyle, the protection of Alaskan lands and waters is also a human-rights issue.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s official recommendation of a Wilderness designation for the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was a huge step in the right direction\u2014the sort of strong action that we need to see more of from leaders across the globe. Alas, it is only a \u201crecommendation\u201d and stronger protections are needed immediately to counter the rush for resources that is taking place all over the Arctic.\n\n\n\nWhile fossil-fuel corporations look at the wilderness of Alaska\u2019s land and water and see a profit to be made, we see a people to protect. We depend on the bounty of what lives here to stay alive, be it the porcupine caribou herds migrating across the plains or the schools of fish in the oceans. And sadly, warming threatens these species, which have, for hundreds of thousands of years, adapted to the (now-thawing) frigid Arctic temperatures. Like the animals that sustain us, the Alaskan people and our culture are built for an Arctic climate. That\u2019s what makes the climate fight so important to us.\n\nSo it\u2019s thrilling to know that more indigenous peoples are joining the climate cause. Last year, for example, frontline native communities featured prominently in the People\u2019s Climate March, the biggest climate protest to date. Building on that success is the People\u2019s Climate Movement, which is doubling down on its efforts to make it clear that climate change is far more than just an environmental issue; it\u2019s also a social-justice issue, as low-income communities bear a disproportionate burden of climate effects.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes the movement unique. It\u2019s not focused on a single group, but on bringing together the many diverse voices, so we can stand together for a common cause. After all, though there are many peoples on this planet, there\u2019s just one atmosphere. And unfortunately, it needs all our help. Because though we sometimes feel isolated, Alaskans alone can\u2019t stop climate change.\n\nWe hope that Obama hears firsthand from our Alaska Native communities the impacts we are facing due to climate change and that he takes this visit as an opportunity to take further actions. The hardships experienced in Alaska, with unprecedented heat and wildfires, have already begun to echo across America. Our Ancestors knew that in order to survive we had to work together. A culture of caring for one another and deep ecology is necessary if we are truly going to tackle climate change.

{"entityId": 1733, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Hate-group membership spiked when Obama first became president, but now it\u2019s decreasing. Maybe things actually are getting a tad better.\n\nWhile political watchers will spend decades debating whether or not President Obama\u2019s election was good for America from a policy standpoint, one issue is not up for debate: The Obama presidency has been great for hate. According to experts, President Obama has been one of the greatest recruitment tools hate groups have seen in decades. But a new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center indicates that the hate parade may be finally coming to an end.\n\nMark Potok, a Southern Poverty Law Center expert, previously reported that there was a 40 percent increase in the number of hate groups from 2000 to 2009. But to put into context just how much hate flourished in the Obama era: On the day after President Obama\u2019s election, 2,000 new members made their way to Stormfront, a popular white supremacist message board.\n\nIn the last five years its membership base has increased 60 percent. Stormfront\u2019s slogan is, \u201cWe are the voice of the new, embattled white minority!\u201d Rants tend to focus on topics like the horrors of mixed-race families, and the particular dangers of a mixed-race president. There have been other high-profile incidents that seemed to indicate that the Obama era was not only not post-racial, but perhaps pretty racist. One of the most disturbing perhaps took place in Virginia, when Easter eggs filled with racist messages were left during a children\u2019s Easter egg hunt last year.\n\nBut while racist rhetoric may be unnerving, there have been more troubling and direct racially charged threats. Shortly after Obama secured the Democratic nomination, a group of skinheads was arrested for plotting to assassinate him. In the midst of this hate-fueled cottage industry there were other incidents that seemed to highlight America\u2019s racial divide in other equally unfortunate ways. There was the Trayvon Martin tragedy, the Michael Brown shooting and its aftermath, and most recently the racist lynching song courtesy of a few University of Oklahoma students. All of these stories considered collectively would seem to indicate that far from bringing us together, the Obama era has helped tear Americans further apart. And yet according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, the numbers finally seem to indicate otherwise.\n\nAccording to the SPLC, the number of hate groups operating in America declined 17 percent in just one year, from 939 in 2013 to 784 in 2014. This marks the fewest hate groups operating in America in a decade. So what gives?\n\nWell, as I have previously written, though the racial rhetoric that has dominated much of the Obama era has been frustrating, heartbreaking, and exhausting at times, we should actually be inspired by it, not discouraged by it. The reason? Because historically race relations in our country have been at their worst when we are on the brink of significant progress. For instance, America\u2019s premier hate group, the Ku Klux Klan, was founded upon slavery\u2019s end.\n\nHate groups tried to stage their last hurrah in the years immediately following the President\u2019s election. But progress has prevailed.\n\nWhile Reconstruction\u2019s golden years produced America\u2019s first black senators (and featured the first empowered black electorate in the South), the era also triggered the Jim Crow backlash, including institutionalized segregation, widespread racial violence, and the rise in power of the Klan. But while it may have taken a long time, we overcame all that, too.\n\nSimilarly, the eventual triumph in Selma that was recently commemorated 50 years later was preceded by unspeakable violence and cruelty. Today some of Selma\u2019s original marchers got to make the same walk, accompanied by the country\u2019s first black president\u2014more specifically a black president who is the product of a relationship between a white woman and a black man\u2014something that would have been a crime in Selma all those years ago.\n\nSo none of us should have been surprised by the reaction the first black president triggered from hate groups. Of course his election made them angry\u2014at him and at our country, which is no longer the America they recognize. It is an America that is getting browner, not whiter, as a white separatist leader I interviewed after Obama\u2019s election lamented to me (Yes, it was a phone interview, i.e. he couldn\u2019t see me.) And it is an America in which mixed-race families are the fastest-growing demographic in this country.\n\nHate groups tried to stage their last hurrah in the years immediately following the President\u2019s election. But in the end the same thing has happened that always does: Progress has prevailed. That doesn\u2019t mean things will be perfect any time soon. But it means things will keep getting better and that one day we\u2019ll look back on this time in our nation\u2019s history the same way we look back on others: with a mixture of shock, embarrassment, awe\u2014and relief that we\u2019ve evolved into a better America.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:20.444+0000"}

And none of those responsible got jail time.\n\nIn 2003, 17-year-old Omar Paisley spent three days in a Florida jail cell moaning in agony. Prison staff said he was faking his illness and told him to suck it up. Then he died.\n\nThis year and last, the deaths of numerous African Americans at the hands or in the custody of prison officials and police\u2014including Michael Brown, Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Tamir Rice, and, most recently, Sandra Bland \u2014have drawn renewed (and belated) national media attention to the state of the criminal justice system. And that, in turn, has made candidates\u2019 stances and records on criminal justice policy a factor in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nIt\u2019s a particularly sensitive topic for Jeb Bush, who as governor faced two situations that mirror the deaths of Gray and Bland, both of whom died while in police custody. When Bush was governor of Florida, two teenagers died preventable deaths while in juvenile detention centers. And Bush\u2019s approach to their cases casts some light on how he might look at criminal justice issues if he becomes president.\n\nPaisley\u2019s death could have been averted, and it took a long time. The African-American teenager was put in the 226-bed Miami-Dade Regional Juvenile Detention Center \u201cfor cutting another youth with a soda can,\u201d the AP reported, and he filled out a form on June 7\u2014one day after going to the jail\u2014saying he was ill.\n\n\u201cMy stomach hurts really bad,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don't know what to do. I cand [sic] sleep.\u201d\n\nSome of the staff at the facility, according to a Feb. 27, 2004, USA Today story, didn\u2019t take him seriously.\n\n\u201cAin\u2019t nothing wrong with his ass,\u201d said one nurse.\n\nAnd supervisor Jack Harrington told Paisley to \u201csuck it up and walk around.\u201d\n\nBut you can\u2019t suck up appendicitis. The paper reported that a guard later found the teen lying in his cell covered in feces and urine, sweating profusely and clutching his stomach. Nurse Dianne Demeritte refused to enter the cell, saying she didn\u2019t \u201cwant to take his [mess] home to my kid.\u201d ( The Palm Beach Post noted that two of his cellmates had to change his sheets and clean up his vomit.)\n\nDemeritte made the sick teen, who could barely walk, walk out of his filthy cell and sit on a chair in the hallway. She concluded that there was \u201cnothing wrong with his ass.\u201d Then, according to USA Today, she filled out paperwork to have him moved to a hospital, left him sitting on the chair, and went on a break. Guards found him passed out and didn\u2019t perform CPR because their first aid kid didn\u2019t contain the necessary equipment.\n\nThat\u2019s how Omar Paisley died.\n\nBush\u2019s communications director, Jill Bratina, sent that USA Today story to the governor and others a few hours after it was published, according to emails made searchable by the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting .\n\nPaisley\u2019s death became national news, and, in one email, Bush promised a constituent it was just an isolated incident.\n\nBill King of Pensacola emailed the governor to voice his outrage about Paisley\u2019s roommates being forced to clean his vomit from their cell.\n\n\u201cThe lives of those kids are as much if not more important than any employee working there as they are not there by choice as the employees are, they are there by design and they have no say over their own lives,\u201d King wrote.\n\n\u201cAll of these children are important and should not be placed into any dangerous or unhealthy situations,\u201d he added.\n\nBush concurred, and emailed King back to say so.\n\n\u201cThe interim Secretary [of Juvenile Justice] is cleaning up the mess,\u201d the governor replied. \u201cThankfully, this is not a problem that is systemic statewide. I appreciate your writing.\u201d\n\nAnd his assistant general counsel, Wendy Berger, emailed another concerned constituent, Lynda Morse, to promise the governor would do everything he could to ensure that no more incarcerated teens would have to suffer Paisley\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cLike many throughout this State, Governor Bush was saddened and outraged over the death of this child,\u201d Berger wrote. \u201cPlease know that those responsible will be held accountable. Governor Bush has full confidence in Interim Secretary [C. George] Denman\u2019s ability to implement needed reforms. His hope is that the changes made in the Department will prevent anything like this from ever happening again.\u201d\n\nThose hopes were misplaced. Some leaders at the Department of Juvenile Justice stepped down in the wake of Paisley\u2019s death, and the department implemented a new policy allowing any staffer or volunteer to call 911 without first having to get permission.\n\nBut there was scant accountability for the adults responsible for Paisley\u2019s death. The two nurses were indicted on murder charges, according to The Palm Beach Post , but neither got jail time. Prison Legal News reported that the prosecutors dropped charges against one of them and that the other nurse\u2014the one who forced Paisley to leave his cell and then insisted that nothing was wrong with him\u2014just gave up her nurse\u2019s license and spent one year on probation. Several prison employees were fired, and Paisley\u2019s mother got a $1.45 million settlement from the Department of Juvenile Justice. In the meantime, nonviolent drug offenders in Florida faced stiff prison sentences.\n\n\u201cIn the tragic cases of Omar Paisley and Martin Lee Anderson, Governor Bush took immediate action to hold those individuals involved in these deaths accountable.\u201d\n\nLess than three years after Paisley\u2019s death, 14-year-old Martin Lee Anderson\u2014also African-American\u2014died in custody at the Bay County Boot Camp detention center in Panama City, Florida. Anderson landed there because he and a few of his cousins took his grandmother\u2019s car joy-riding and then crashed it, according the book The Boys of the Dark: A Story of Betrayal and Redemption in the Deep South, by Robin Gaby Fisher, Michael O\u2019McCarthy, and Robert W. Straley.\n\n\n\nA video showed seven guards at the boot-camp detention center kicking, kneeing, and hitting the 14-year-old because he wouldn\u2019t run around a track, according to WCTV .\n\n\u201cA medical examiner originally said the teenager died of Sickle Cell trait, but after Anderson\u2019s body was exhumed, a second autopsy revealed he did not die of natural causes,\u201d reported WCTV.\n\nBush appointed the special prosecutor who ordered the second autopsy that found Anderson didn\u2019t die of natural causes. That autopsy \u201cdetermined that by blocking Martin\u2019s mouth and forcing him to inhale ammonia fumes\u2014an effort, the guards said, to revive him\u2014they had caused his vocal cords to spasm and block his airway,\u201d The New York Times reported .\n\nAnderson\u2019s family got a $5 million settlement from the state. An all-white jury acquitted the guards who beat and kneed him on video, Time reported.\n\nLater, Bush signed legislation eliminating juvenile detention boot camps in the state. The New York Times noted that previously, Bush was \u201ca strong supporter\u201d of the boot camps. And during his failed 1994 gubernatorial campaign, he told the Orlando Sentinel that he wanted to \u201creform our juvenile-justice system by emphasizing punishment over therapy for juvenile offenders.\u201d\n\nThe teens\u2019 deaths may have changed his view.\n\n\u201cThroughout Gov. Bush\u2019s tenure, he worked to reform the juvenile justice system in Florida to improve services, help young offenders turn their lives around and give them the tools needed to be successful in the future,\u201d Bush aide Kristy Campbell said via email.\n\nCampbell noted that the juvenile crime rate dropped by 18 percent during Bush\u2019s tenure in office and that the rate of juveniles entering the adult system went down by more than 40 percent.\n\n\u201cIn the tragic cases of Omar Paisley and Martin Lee Anderson, Governor Bush took immediate action to hold those individuals involved in these deaths accountable and to provide additional funding to increase staff and services at juvenile justice facilities,\u201d she added.\n\nThe 911 reforms Bush\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice implemented after Paisley\u2019s death don\u2019t seem to have outlasted his time in office with complete success. On July 10, 2011, four and a half years after Bush\u2019s departure, another teen, 18-year-old Eric Perez, died in a manner that CBS Miami called \u201chauntingly similar\u201d to Paisley\u2019s. It also recalled Anderson\u2019s death: Guards at the West Palm Beach juvenile detention center where Perez was held roughhoused with him, picking him up and dropping him, before he retreated, hallucinated, passed out, and died.\n\nOne guard said Perez was faking his illness and decided that sending him to a hospital wasn\u2019t worth the paperwork, CBS Miami reported.\n\n\u201c[Superintendent Anthony] Flowers insisted he never \u2018prohibited or discouraged\u2019 staff from calling 911,\u201d the station reported. \u201cBut officers on the scene said they were told the superintendent had ordered staff not to call for help.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough administrators had pledged years earlier to \u2018treat every child as if he was your own,\u2019 detention staff had, once again, neglected a youth to death,\u201d the station continued.\n\nAnd another guard, Floyd Powell, said his superiors specifically told him not to dial 911\u2014even though he feared, correctly, that the worst would happen. He told the Miami Herald that he was later fired for sharing that detail with investigators.\n\nCathy Purvis Lively, the attorney who represented Powell during that time, told The Daily Beast that systemic problems set up Perez\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cThe overwhelming concern was staffing,\u201d she said.\n\nCalling 911 meant sending a prison staffer to the hospital along with Perez, and endemic overcrowding and understaffing meant supervisors often hesitated to make the call.\n\n\u201cThere were multiple problems,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the time, I was representing someone who was essentially the scapegoat, the low guy on the totem pole.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was the one trying to seek intervention,\u201d she added.\n\nPerez\u2019s death wasn\u2019t unforeshadowed. Dale Dobuler took over the Miami-Dade Regional Juvenile Detention Center after Paisley\u2019s death and watched the rollout of the reforms from Bush\u2019s Department of Juvenile Justice. He quit because he didn\u2019t think he could keep the detainees under his watch safe, as \u201cmany of the protections put in place after Omar\u2019s death already had begun to erode,\u201d according to the Palm Beach Post.\n\nI asked Dobuler if he stands by those comments in retrospect.\n\n\u201cI stand by my comments,\u201d he said in an email. \u201cThey were accurate when I made them and remain accurate now\u2014though I obviously now have less insight into the current state of affairs with DJJ. The fact is, in the aftermath of the Paisley tragedy, DJJ was able to put significant resources in place to address some of the systemic issues at Miami (and other detention centers). With time (and less public attention and media scrutiny), those resources were taken away bit by bit as a result of funding concerns. At the time I left in 2008, I was very concerned that no matter how much of a leadership effort I made locally, it was only a matter of time before another tragedy took place that I would not be able to prevent.\u201d\n\nThe failures of Florida\u2019s prison system weren\u2019t unique to Bush\u2019s governorship, as Perez\u2019s death shows. In October 2007, Time detailed a lengthy history of horrific abuse in the state\u2019s prisons that predated Bush. And those kinds of abuses also happen around the country.\n\nAfter the acquittal of the prison guards who watched Anderson die, his parents\u2019 attorney, Benjamin Crump, summed up the verdict this way:", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:21.089+0000"}

According to Gallup, the percentage of Americans with \u201ca great deal/quite a lot of confidence\u201d in police has dropped from 64 percent in 2004 to just 52 percent, its lowest number in 22 years.\n\nThe suspect in Goforth\u2019s murder, Shannon Miles, has a long history of violence and mental problems, including being declared \u201cmentally incompetent\u201d to stand trial in 2012 on felony assault charges. Connecting Miles\u2019 horrific crimes to anything other than his own twisted mind makes as much sense as linking Jared Loughner, who shot former Arizona congresswoman Gabby Giffords, to the Tea Party or Sarah Palin PAC advertisements. Which is to say: None at all (Loughner was not just nuts, to the extent he followed the news, he watched MSNBC and UFO conspiracy docs.)\n\nThe rising use of body cameras all over the country isn\u2019t being done to document a \u201cwar on cops\u201d but to promote essential peace and trust between citizens and police.\n\nYet at a press conference announcing Miles\u2019s arrest, Sheriff Ron Hickman argued that \u201cvery dangerous national rhetoric\u201d that\u2019s critical of law enforcement is at least partly to blame. \u201cWhen rhetoric ramps up to the point where cold-blooded assassination has happened, this rhetoric has gotten out of control,\u201d Hickman said. \u201cWe heard \u2018black lives matter.\u2019 All lives matter. Well, cops\u2019 lives matter too, so why don\u2019t we drop the qualifier and say \u2018lives matter\u2019 and take that to the bank.\u201d\n\nHickman\u2019s sentiments echo throughout police departments around the country. \u201cIf I don\u2019t know you,\u201d one Arizona cop told the Los Angeles Times, \u201cI\u2019m going to be extra guarded around you\u2026 It is a different world.\u201d Such thoughts are resounding especially loudly in media outlets such as Fox News, where hosts ranging from staid morning-show business reporter Stuart Varney to primetime blowhard Sean Hannity have been quick to adopt the \u201cwar on cops\u201d motif. Ted Cruz, never one not to hitch a ride on a media bandwagon, has also gotten into the act. \u201cCops across this country are feeling the assault,\u201d says the Texas Republican and presidential hopeful. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling the assault from the president, from the top on down as we see.\u201d\n\nSuch reactions are not just grotesquely opportunistic, they\u2019re wrong in two fundamental ways.\n\nFirst\u2014and most importantly\u2014there is no \u201cwar on cops,\u201d if the term suggests increasingly brazen and numerous open \u201cexecutions\u201d of police officers. The National Law Enforcement Officers Fund, which tracks police deaths, finds that the number of police killed in assaults so far this year is 25, the same as last year. The FBI says that while the number of cops \u201cfeloniously killed\u201d each year has fluctuated over the past decade, \u201cit stands at about 50.\u201d As my Reason colleague Ed Krayewski writes, \u201cIn 2007, there were 67 cops shot and killed in the line of duty. In 2007 there was no \u2018national conversation\u2019 about police reform, no sustained focus on criminal justice reform, nothing in the national zeitgeist that would suggest the number of murders were the result of anything more than the number of people who had killed cops that year.\u201d\n\nSecond, to the extent that there is serious discussion about reforming criminal justice practices, it is driven by highly publicized cases of overreaction or brutality by law enforcement that is increasingly visible due to smart phone cameras and social media. The 2011 case of Kelly Thomas, a 37-year-old schizophrenic drifter beaten to death by Fullerton, California, police, perfectly illustrates the real \u201cnew world\u201d faced by police. It was only after Thomas\u2019s father took gruesome pictures of his comatose son\u2019s severely battered body and face and shared them via social media that public pressure grew for a full investigation and trial.\n\nIn the past year alone, high-profile events in Ferguson, Staten Island, Troy, Ohio and elsewhere have sparked a nationwide movement to rethink not just policing strategies but also the ways in which race factors into law enforcement and how local governments abuse their power to levy fines and fees on their poorest residents. The rising use of body cameras all over the country isn\u2019t being done to document a \u201cwar on cops\u201d but to promote essential peace and trust between citizens and police.\n\nIt\u2019s a sad coincidence that Darren Goforth\u2019s funeral will take place just as the trial begins for the officers accused in the death of Freddie Gray, the Baltimore man who died this year from injuries suffered during police custody.\n\nBy all accounts, Goforth was an honorable man and a credit to law enforcement and his murder is as tragic and disturbing as it is senseless. But if his brothers and sisters in blue and their partisans in politics and the press simply use his killing as an excuse to avoid ongoing reform, there\u2019s no reason to believe public confidence in the police will rebound any time soon.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:21.855+0000"}

Back here on Planet Earth, it\u2019s a tad different.\n\nSo now I\u2019m supposed to believe that Hillary Clinton turned the Department of State into a giant shakedown operation? According to Beltway conventional wisdom, it seems that I am compelled to believe exactly that. Because you know those Clintons.\n\nAnd so we have a lot of credulous hand-waving about this new book. Conservative sharpen their knives, liberals sweat bullets that it\u2019s all over. But very few people stop to think: Clinton has been in our faces for 20-plus years. Where is any evidence of real corruption? I don\u2019t mean stuff you may not have liked or that kinda looked funny. I mean actual, Rhode-Island-style, steal-a-hot-stove corruption.\n\nDon\u2019t say Whitewater. She endured millions of dollars\u2019 worth of investigations by a prosecutor (Ken Starr) who quite obviously wanted to nail her to the wall, and he came up with nothing. I still remember, by the way, the hopped-up political atmosphere after Bill Safire wrote a column calling her a \u201ccongenital liar\u201d and predicted that she was going to be indicted any day now. It was not unlike the mood this week, as we anticipate The New York Times and The Washington Post\u2019s reducing themselves into effectively collaborating with Fox News to trumpet Peter Schweizer\u2019s book, Clinton Cash. But Safire was wrong, as he in fact so often was about so many things, and Starr never got her.\n\nCattle futures, billing records\u2014it\u2019s all the same. Thousands of people, people who hate her and want to see her thrown in jail, have been over and over and over these things. I know the fact that she walks freely among us suggests to many people that she and Bill are so brilliantly devious that they always knew exactly how to get away with it. But just maybe Occam\u2019s Razor applies here, and she\u2019s never done anything illegal.\n\nAnd now she is supposed to have muscled through a trade deal with Colombia to thank a donor to her husband\u2019s foundation. Right. Look at the chronology.\n\nThe man whose business interests the Colombia deal apparently advanced was named Frank Giustra, a Bill friend who has, as we shall see, come up before in the media in this connection. Giustra gave the Clinton Foundation $131 million\u2014$31 million in 2006, [NOTE: this initially said 2005 but has been corrected] and another $100 million pledged that same year that he made good on over the next three years, up through 2008.\n\nI know the fact that she walks freely among us suggests to many people that she and Bill are so brilliantly devious that they always knew exactly how to get away with it.\n\nNow, 2008, you will recall, was when Hillary Clinton was running for president. It would stand to reason, would it not, that if Clinton was so intent on advancing Giustra\u2019s Colombian business interests, she would have been for the trade deal at the exact moment Giustra finished paying her husband $131 million? But she was against it as a candidate, and implacably so! \u201cI will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement,\u201d she said on the stump in Pennsylvania that April.\n\nThat\u2019s not exactly the position of someone shilling for a donor, but I suppose if you\u2019re a committed enough Clintonologist, you can turn it all into a conspiracy\u2014she was just opposing it then to throw the rest of us off the scent, but she\u2019d support it later when it mattered. In fact, she was so intent on hiding her \u201creal\u201d position that she even parted ways with campaign manager Mark Penn because he was consulting for the Colombian government in behalf of the deal.\n\nSo then she became Secretary of State. And, indeed, she did start supporting it\u2014but after that became the administration\u2019s position. Obama had also opposed the deal, which the Bush administration had begun negotiating with Colombia back in 2006, as a candidate. But the Obama administration used the Colombia deal as a test case for whether it could get a trade partner to agree to tougher labor protections (there was, and still is, violence against trade unionists in Colombia, although the number of killings has gone down since the pact) as part of gaining access to U.S. markets. The labor provisions got in there. People debate today how much good they\u2019ve done, but they\u2019re in there, and so Obama and Clinton changed their position and backed the deal.\n\nNow, for Clinton to have known in 2008 that all this would play out to Frank Giustra\u2019s benefit, she would have had to have known that Obama was going to beat John McCain and, rather more improbably than that, that Obama was going to appoint her to be his Secretary of State. But those wily Clintons know things like that, see.\n\nI will grant you, she and Obama did not change their positions for reasons that Frank Capra would make a movie about. They changed them, I would imagine, because business and agricultural interests wanted the deal and had more power than the labor and human rights interests that opposed it. You can decry that, too, but it\u2019s just politics.\n\nThink Progress got a copy of Schweizer\u2019s book, and on their description it actually sounds like it\u2019s going to disappoint the heavy breathers. Aviva Shen writes: \u201cSchweizer explains he cannot prove the allegations, leaving that up to investigative journalists and possibly law enforcement.\u201d \u201cPossibly\u201d law enforcement. Nice touch.\n\nWhile I\u2019m at it with the irony quotes, I might as well drape some around that adjective \u201cinvestigative\u201d too. The Times, it seems, has decided to debase itself by following the breadcrumbs dropped by this former adviser to Sarah Palin because Schweizer devotes a chapter to Giustra and Kazakhstan, which the Times reported on back in 2008, and the Times plans to follow up on that.\n\nI remember reading that Times story at the time and going, \u201cWow, that does look bad.\u201d But then I also remember reading this Forbes (yes, Forbes!) debunking of the Times story, which was headlined \u201cClinton Commits No Foul in Kazakhstan Uranium Deal.\u201d By the time I finished reading that piece (and please, click through and read it so that you are forearmed for the coming Times hit job), I was marveling to myself: Golly, that Times piece looked so awful at the time. But it turns out they just left out some facts, obscured some others, and without being technically inaccurate, managed to convey or imply that something skuzzy happened where it in fact hadn\u2019t.

Hodges, the case that will determine, definitively, whether same-sex marriage is legal in America by answering two questions: Is it constitutional for states to deny same-sex couples the right to marry; and are states constitutionally required to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. Legal experts predict the court will come down on the side of marriage-equality proponents.\n\nMarriage equality is so overwhelmingly accepted, in fact, that a popular narrative among social conservatives is that those who remain opposed to gay marriage are being bullied and discriminated against by those who support it.\n\nCruz and Huckabee usually sound like they are on the verge of waving snakes in the air and speaking in tongues.\n\nBut if you had been medically frozen in, say, 2003 and thawed out on Saturday at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition Spring Kick-Off event, you would probably be under the impression that a clear victor of this particular culture war has yet to emerge.\n\nAt the Point of Grace Church in Waukee, a Des Moines suburb, candidate after candidate (or likely-candidate) pledged support for a constitutional amendment that would overrule the Supreme Court\u2019s decision and allow states to ban same-sex marriage again. (How this would work is not quite obvious.)\n\nTed Cruz warned the crowd that liberals are trying to enforce \u201cmandatory gay marriage in all 50 states.\u201d He will be praying on Tuesday as the oral arguments take place, he said, and he asked the crowd to join him.\n\nBobby Jindal, Marco Rubio, Rick Perry, Mike Huckabee, Scott Walker, and Rick Santorum all made similar pronouncements. (Rand Paul somehow managed to steer clear of the topic altogether.)\n\nBut Cruz in particular had reason to succumb to hyperbole. While the senator from Texas has maintained a vehemently anti-marriage equality stance for the duration of his political career\u2014even, as a means of appealing to social conservatives, announcing his presidential bid at Liberty University, an evangelical college that he A. did not attend, and B. is not based in the state he represents\u2014he did, last week, make what was perceived as a misstep.\n\nCruz was hosted at the New York City apartment of two openly gay hotel magnates. At the gathering, which Cruz insists (and The Daily Beast\u2019s Jay Michaelson reports) was really just about Israel, Cruz said, \u201cIf one of my daughters was gay, I would love them just as much.\u201d (The event didn\u2019t just have fallout for Cruz, but for his hosts, who, after facing boycotts, apologized for daring to speak to someone with different beliefs than them.)\n\nIt would seem Cruz\u2019s performance at the Faith and Freedom event was bombastic enough to make a full recovery. Not that he was alone\u2014if there is one thing anti-gay marriage types sure love, it\u2019s theater.\n\nHuckabee, the former governor of Arkansas, told the audience that the country is \u201ccriminalizing Christianity in this country by telling people who hold to an orthodox worldview of biblical marriage that if you still believe that\u2026you will be guilty of discrimination, which could result in some kind of civil or criminal action against you.\u201d\n\nPresumably Huckabee was referring to the plight of Memories Pizza, the independent Indiana pizza shop that became the subject of controversy\u2014and right-wing acclaim\u2014when its owners said they would not cater a gay wedding. The store closed for eight days, during which time the owners raised close to $1 million. On the ninth day, God reopened Memories Pizza to a packed house. Civil or criminal action against you.\n\nWhile most of the country favors the legalization of same-sex marriage, Republicans overwhelmingly do not. According to that Washington Post-ABC poll, over 60 percent of Republicans and more than 70 percent of conservative Republicans remain opposed.\n\nAppearing soft on traditional marriage could prove fatal in the primary, where socially conservative voters hold significant power. Candidates prone to more moderate rhetoric on marriage (if not actually moderate policies)\u2014Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and Rand Paul\u2014must compete with the likes of Cruz and Huckabee, both of whom usually sound like they are on the verge of waving snakes in the air and speaking in tongues.\n\nThis places Republican candidates in a tough position.

But back in high school, he was popular.\n\nChristie went on to the University of Delaware and then Seton Hall Law School. In the early 1990s, he began his political career by running, unsuccessfully, for the New Jersey State Senate. He would get elected to the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders in 1994, and then, after two failed local and state campaigns, he would leave politics to focus on his law practice\u2014and campaign for George W. Bush.\n\nThat would pay off. In 2002, Bush appointed Christie as the United States Attorney. He remained in the office for eight years, making a name for himself as a corruption-buster who nailed over 100 public officials.\n\nAlmost at the same time that he was elected governor, in 2009, chatter began about a potential bid for the White House. In 2012, Republican party leaders and the national media wanted him to run for the nomination so badly that he memorably said, \u201cShort of suicide, I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019d have to do to convince you people that I\u2019m not running. I\u2019m not running.\u201d\n\nHe did run for reelection, however, and in 2013 he won in a landslide.

When his father announced his presidential candidacy in October 1987 to succeed President Reagan, the cover of Newsweek featured the vice president piloting his yacht with the words, \u201cFighting The Wimp Factor.\u201d\n\nIt was a searing metaphor for the elder Bush\u2019s passivity and his seeming lack of toughness. A decorated World War II veteran whose heroism had never been questioned, Bush\u2019s New England patrician sensibilities had long ago obscured his war record, and eight years as a subservient vice president didn\u2019t help.\n\nThe elder Bush went on to win the nomination and to run a campaign second to none in its toughness. He set down a marker that his first-born son followed\u2014George W. embraced the psychological warfare it takes to win\u2014and perhaps now his second-born son will, too.\n\nBut for now, Trump is the master. He\u2019s taunting and mocking and belittling the other candidates, and if the other candidates ignore him on the theory they don\u2019t want to feed the beast, he gets covered and they sink in the polls. If they engage him, as Bush has tentatively begun to do, it\u2019s the same phenomenon. He gets covered and they sink in the polls.\n\n\u201cCandidates routinely play with each other\u2019s heads, but no one has been as blatant and brazen as Trump,\u201d says Pitney. He recalls Bob Dole barking to Bush in the \u201988 race, \u201cQuit lyin\u2019 about my record,\u201d and Bush needling Republican rival Pete Dupont by calling him \u201cPierre.\u201d Now, it\u2019s an every day occurrence for Trump to call other candidates \u201cmorons\u201d or \u201cidiots\u201d or \u201closers,\u201d and with rare exception they take the broadsides.\n\nThe dynamic is reminiscent of a joke President Reagan used to tell about a guy who seeks help from a psychiatrist because his brother thinks he\u2019s a chicken. How long has this been going on, he\u2019s asked. Fifteen years. Why didn\u2019t you seek help sooner? Because we needed the eggs, he replies.\n\nThat sums up the dilemma Republicans face. They need the eggs; they don\u2019t want to offend Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nTrump has shone a harsh light on the rest of the Republican field, exposing the vapidity and mediocrity of the candidates, who have been touted as this sterling field of current and former governors and senators. None has shown good political chops; they don\u2019t know how to make themselves and their ideas stand out, to the extent they have any beyond the usual sound bites.\n\n\u201cOne of the problems is they\u2019re all scared to death he\u2019ll take his marbles and go home,\u201d says Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former domestic policy adviser in the Clinton White House. \u201cAn independent Trump candidacy would destroy the Republican Party\u2019s prospects, and they know it. They have no idea where his limits are\u2014if any exist.\u201d\n\nTrump is very good at is negotiating tactics and he\u2019s using the leverage of a potential third-party bid to suppress the full-throated response that many of the candidates would like to voice but don\u2019t dare for fear of what Trump might do. He\u2019s now signed the RNC\u2019s \u201cloyalty pledge,\u201d but not everyone is convinced that a non-binding agreement will ensure Trump doesn\u2019t play the spoiler.\n\nAs for what motivates Trump, I turned to Dr. Jerrold Post, founding director of the Political Psychology Program at George Washington University and author of Narcissism and Politics: Dreams of Glory, which was published last year.

What the hell happened this weekend?\n\nI wasn\u2019t fired. I quit. And I quit because I felt I was having no impact on the direction of the campaign, which got off to an extraordinarily good start. I think he\u2019s unique, in that he has the stature and the media access and independence to drive a reform message all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nThey claim you were fired.\n\nThe claim that I was fired was quickly disproved\u2026I left on my own volition, but I continue to strongly support Trump because I think he has a unique opportunity here, and it would really be tragic if he doesn\u2019t realize his full potential.\n\nRight, but somebody on his campaign presumably lied about this. Aren\u2019t you pissed?\n\nThis is the oldest fight in American politics. It\u2019s the advance men and the merchandisers versus those men and women of ideas. I think politics is about sweeping big ideas, and a few memorable phrases to get people to remember them. It\u2019s not about minutiae\u2026and I just think it is tragic that the Trump campaign appears to have gone into this cul-de-sac where we\u2019re bickering with Megyn Kelly\u2014who is not running for president.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the first time Trump said something insulting on this campaign.\n\nIn all fairness, he\u2019s absolutely right about illegal immigration\u2026If any illegal commits any crime\u2026that\u2019s one crime too many. And Trump\u2019s very important point was dramatized by the Steinle murder in San Francisco. The illegal who killed this woman had been thrown out of the country and returned five times. The U.S. Senate would not even be considering doing away with sanctuary cities if Donald Trump hadn\u2019t elevated this issue in the public consciousness.\n\nSo was it the Megyn Kelly comments that caused you to resign?\n\nIn all honesty, I thought Trump won the exchange with Kelly in the debate. He should have just left it there. It was the next day that I think was counterproductive. I was really hoping that he would pivot to his issue agenda.\n\nBut instead, he starts tweeting about Megyn Kelly. So are you saying he\u2019s actually sending his own tweets?\n\nTrump\u2019s style is not going to change. He is unscripted. He is unhandled. He is un-coached. Nobody puts words in his mouth. He does operate his own Twitter feed. I just think he is, to a certain extent, being ill served by yes men\u2014people who say \u201cyes sir\u201d but never raise an alternative view of what ought to be done.\n\n\n\nIt sounds like the villain is his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. Is he trying to get rid of Trump loyalists?\n\nYeah, he reminds me a lot of [former Nixon Chief of Staff] Bob Haldeman\u2014and he\u2019ll probably end up the same way.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re having to go back and explain a gaffe, that\u2019s counterproductive.\u201d\n\nWhat about Sam Nunberg, who got fired the other week over some allegedly racist things he posted on Facebook?\n\nHe was the campaign wonk. Very bright guy. He\u2019s got some issues. Yeah, he\u2019s somewhat neurotic\u2014because he believes in ideas. And he believes in Trump. And he wants to see a professional campaign move forward. So, do I think he was set up? Yeah, I do think he was set up. Do I think it\u2019s unfortunate? I think the campaign will miss him.\n\nBack to Megyn Kelly and the \u201cbleeding\u201d comment. Trump claims he wasn\u2019t referring to her period, but\u2014\n\n\n\nYou know what, Gerald Ford said he didn\u2019t mean Poland was free of Russian influence right after he said it. When you\u2019re explaining, you\u2019re losing ground. When you\u2019re having to go back and explain a gaffe, that\u2019s counterproductive.\n\nBut it is a problem to declare war on Fox News, right?\n\nIt\u2019s counterproductive. You have to recognize that Fox is reaching somewhere between seven and eight out of ten of the primary voters that Trump needs to be concerned about. CNN is only reaching about four out of ten. Their audiences are very, very different\u2026I think the voters would rather go to war with Iran and China over trade, rather than go to war with Fox News.\n\nOkay, I want to switch gears. There\u2019s an allegation out there today that Trump is funneling money to Breitbart in return for favorable coverage. Is this true?\n\nIt\u2019s funny because both [Newsmax\u2019s] Chris Ruddy and [The Daily Caller\u2019s] Tucker Carlson called me this morning to ask where their payoffs are.\n\n[Laughs.]\n\nThat is, to my knowledge, totally false. Trump has never paid for any kind of media coverage, online, or otherwise\u2014at least as far as I know. But [Buzzfeed\u2019s] McKay Coppins is really not a credible reporter. He\u2019s the same guy who wrote that Trump would never run, and that Trump would never file his financial disclosures, and that if Trump did run that he would fall flat on his face.\n\nSo McKay Coppins is zero for three. Why anyone would buy his book about the Republican process, given the fact that he\u2019s now zero for four, kind of astounds me.\n\nDamn, you\u2019re good with the quotes. Why don\u2019t we just interview you all the time?\n\nWe do. I\u2019m the men\u2019s fashion correspondent for the Daily Caller. And if I don\u2019t get a fashion piece out soon, Tucker\u2019s going to brain me.\n\nAny comments on Trump\u2019s fashion sense?\n\nThe most exciting thing in the last week was that Trump decided to wear the red \u201cpower tie,\u201d because Trump is the man to define it. The red power tie was on the cover of The Art of The Deal. He\u2019s the guy who made it a thing in the \u201970s. It was almost like a signature thing.\n\nIt sounds like you wanted to preserve Trump\u2019s unique style, but add maybe just a touch of political strategy and organization to the chaos. It reminds me of what Ed Rollins tried, but failed to do, with Ross Perot, but\u2014\n\nI\u2019m not familiar with Ed Rollins ever actually running a successful campaign. And the one he did run in New Jersey for Christie Whitman, he, of course, ended up before the grand jury, trying to explain whether he had gone out and tried to suppress the black vote.\n\nSecond, I\u2019m not really in the school of trashing my clients. I mean, Ed Rollins has trashed \u201cPresident Bachmann,\u201d who he worked for, \u201cPresident Huckabee,\u201d who he worked for, \u201cPresident Perot,\u201d who he worked for. I have no interest in trashing my clients, even when I disagree with them. I am not going to say anything negative about Donald Trump\u2026and I\u2019m not going to be in the Rollins school of denouncing those who have paid me.\n\nSo you\u2019re still a Trump fan?\n\nLook, he\u2019s the greatest salesman who ever lived. And that enthusiasm, that upbeat enthusiasm, kind of reminds me of Reagan. He thinks the country is in deep trouble. But that our best days are still ahead of us, not behind us. And it can be infectious. Those of us who are still Trump loyalists use as our hashtag #yuge. The people who use that are the Trump loyalists.\n\nSo how does this end?\n\nThis is going to be a very long race. I think that because all the primaries up till March 14 are proportional\u2026you could have a very long, drawn out struggle for the nomination. You could have a brokered convention. Therefore, you could have a convention that is settled on the basis of negotiations between the camps. And there is no greater negotiator than Donald Trump.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:23.175+0000"}

Or something.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate is taking heat from the right for comments he made about a controversial federal program, and it could make his life a little complicated.\n\nThe Florida senator is far from being the front-runner, but he seems to be in a good place; his favorable ratings are quite lofty, his debate performance drew plaudits from all the right people, and he\u2019s managed to carve out a niche for himself as a smart guy on defense issues. If the immigration fever breaks and those issues return to prominence, then Rubio could have some explaining to do.\n\nThat\u2019s because earlier in August in a speech at an event Politico dubbed \u201ca Koch love fest,\u201d the presidential contender and Senate Foreign Relations Committee member said he thinks we need to give tax dollars to sugar barons because otherwise the terrorists will win.\n\nOkay, that\u2019s not exactly what he said, but it\u2019s close. The senator told attendees that he would only favor ending federal financial perks for the sugar industry if other countries did the same thing\u2014in other words, when it comes to sugar subsidies, Rubio opposes unilateral disarmament.\n\n\u201c[H]ere\u2019s why,\u201d he told attendees, per National Review. \u201cOtherwise, Brazil will wipe out our agriculture and it\u2019s not just sugar.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur food security and, therefore, our national security depends on it,\u201d Rubio wrote.\n\nOur agriculture. All those big red barns. Gone. Poof.\n\n\u201cOther countries will capture the market share, our agricultural capacity will be developed into real estate, you know, housing and so forth, and then we lose the capacity to produce our own food, at which point we\u2019re at the mercy of a foreign country for food security,\u201d he continued.\n\nGod forbid we get things from other countries. The sugar program, by the way, spends hundreds of millions of dollars every year to drive up the cost of sugar and keep the sugar industry profitable. Conservatives, as a general rule, hate it and see it as an example of the expensive cronyism that props up well-connected industries at the expense of taxpayers and consumers.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Rubio has suggested federal handouts for the sugar industry are basically the only thing between us and Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. When he voted against ending the sugar program in 2012, the senator put out a press release with an impassioned defense of the sugar status quo.\n\n\u201cOur food security and, therefore, our national security depends on it,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn National Review on Monday, columnist Windsor Mann ripped Rubio a new one over the comments.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s try to untangle this,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf we get rid of sugar subsidies, Americans will turn their sugar farms into condominium lots and start buying sugar from foreigners, who will starve us until we surrender to ISIS. Or something like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cObesity causes deaths,\u201d he continued. \u201cSugar causes obesity. The government subsidizes sugar. You subsidize the government. You subsidize death. The terrorists win. This syllogism makes at least as much sense as what Rubio said.\u201d\n\nI emailed Rubio\u2019s team to see if they had thoughts on this summation of the senator\u2019s views\u2014that there\u2019s a causal link between the existence of sugar subsidies and the fact that there isn\u2019t yet an Islamic State El Paso. They didn\u2019t get back to me.\n\nIn the meantime, though, here\u2019s something interesting: One of Rubio\u2019s most open-handed donors is also\u2014this will stun you\u2014a major benefactor of the the sugar subsidies that protect us from al Qaeda. Pepe Fanjul, a south Florida sugar magnate, was listed on an invitation for one of Rubio\u2019s first big-deal fundraisers when he started running for Senate in 2010, according to SaintPetersBlog.\n\nSince then, Rubio has been a constant benefactor of Fanjul\u2019s largesse. As The Washington Examiner\u2019s Tim Carney notes, Fanjul and his son both maxed out to Rubio in the early days of his campaign and hosted a number of fundraisers for him over the course of the contest. Fanjul has also given generously to the Rubio-affiliated Reclaim America PAC. The Washington Post noted that Fanjul was \u201cintroducing him to well-heeled donors.\u201d Naturally, Fanjul is helping Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign fundraise as well. And he was there to give him a big hug right after the senator announced his presidential bid. They seem tight.\n\nVanity Fair ran a lengthy piece about Fanjul\u2019s sugar empire in 2011, noting that he and his brother Alfy\u2014a Democrat\u2014have remarkable access to the politicians they boost, and reap cushy benefits from those relationships. Alfy co-chaired Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential bid in the state, according to the magazine, and developed a cozy relationship with the then-Arkansas governor.\n\n\u201cThe most telling thing about Alfy Fanjul is that he can get the president of the United States on the telephone in the middle of a blow job,\u201d said Carl Hiaasen, a columnist for the Miami Herald.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just Fanjul. In 2014\u2014when he wasn\u2019t even up for reelection\u2014Rubio was one of the senators to benefit most from sugar money, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nBut hey, who wouldn\u2019t want to take money from an industry that both produces a tasty coffee accompaniment and keeps America safe from another 9/11?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:23.458+0000"}
{"entityId": 1743, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Meet Dennis Cheng, the longtime Clinton aide in charge of raising hundreds of millions for Hillary\u2019s presidential run.\n\nDennis Cheng, the finance director of Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, the man behind what has been predicted to grow to a $2 billion operation, is serious, soft-spoken, unflappable, and fiercely loyal to his boss.\n\nHe is never quoted in the press. He doesn\u2019t participate in profiles, won\u2019t be interviewed, and doesn\u2019t head to cable TV to defend Hillary Clinton against the Republican onslaught. In a political-media sphere in which contact with the Clintons can be a golden ticket to every green room of your dreams, Cheng is determined to be unseen and unheard from.\n\nBut, if some Republican operatives have their way, he\u2019s about to become the face of Clintonian corruption.\n\nTo hear them tell it, Cheng is the Clinton family\u2019s shadowy and silent partner, one who bounces between the various planets in the Clinton universe, tasked with the one job that the Clintons value above all else: gobbling up hordes of cash.\n\nAnd they plan to make Cheng known to the wider public, hoping that he becomes the face of the interwoven worlds of Hillary Clinton. And if it hurts her fundraising too, well, all the better.\n\nThey point to his time as a fundraiser for Clinton\u2019s 2008 presidential bid, his time as deputy chief of protocol in the Clinton State Department, and from there, to the Death Star, otherwise known as the Clinton Foundation.\n\n\u201cCheng has been at the very heart of the Clinton family money machine for years,\u201d reads the opening graf of a \u201cbackground report\u201d provided to The Daily Beast that was put together by the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT), a conservative good-government outfit designed as a counterpoint to the left-leaning Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).\n\n\u201cWe are interested in the relationship between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department,\u201d said Matthew Whitaker, FACT DC\u2019s executive director. His group has filed freedom of information requests in order to see what Cheng\u2019s role was, if any, in any back-channeling between the two Clinton concerns. \u201cIt seems to us that he is the conduit between where official State business interacts with Clinton Foundation business. He is a young guy who has known nothing other than Hillary Clinton and her money.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor nearly a decade, Dennis Cheng has been one of the main power players at the heart of the vast Clinton money machine,\u201d said Colin Reed, the executive director of America Rising PAC, a Republican opposition research outfit that has been churning out negative stories on Hillary for several years now.\n\n\u201cHe was one of the leaders of the Clinton Foundation apparatus that raised nearly a quarter billion dollars, including money from foreign governments, and remains a key figure of the 2016 operation that\u2019s pledged to raise a record-breaking $2.5 billion.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople perceive that making Dennis happy is making Hillary happy, and there are only a handful of people in that orbit you can say that about.\u201d\n\nThe idea of picking out an otherwise anonymous staffer and portraying him as a modern-day Rasputin has a long history in politics. Democrats did it to Karl Rove, Republicans to David Axelrod and Valerie Jarrett. For Clintonites, the coming effort to turn him into a kind of Benghazi in human form is ridiculous, and smacks of the GOP\u2019s knuckle-dragging obsession to turn everything associated with Clinton into somehow being associated with wrong-doing.\n\n\u201cOh, please,\u201d said John Morgan, a wealthy Florida attorney who recently hosted a fundraiser in his home. \u201cThe Clintons would be attacked if they named Mother Theresa their finance chair.\u201d\n\nCheng declined to comment for this story. But when this reporter off-handedly mentioned to a source that this story was in the works, it prompted an immediate phone call from a Clinton spokesperson to find out more.\n\nOne longtime source, who counts Cheng as a close friend, declined to speak in even the most general terms about him, saying, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to do anything to mess up the campaign.\u201d Many of the more than a dozen top donors contacted for this story said much the same thing. \u201cIt will be an unnecessary headache if I talk to you,\u201d said one West Coast-based fundraiser for Clinton.\n\nOne thing that Cheng\u2019s detractors get right is that he is exceptionally close to Hillary Clinton. And such proximity is necessary considering the gargantuan task ahead of him: helping to raise the campaign\u2019s part in what has been predicted to be a multi-billion dollar operation.\n\nIn conversations with a dozen of some of the Clinton operation\u2019s biggest fundraisers, those who have raised a million dollars or more, many repeated the same thing\u2014that when you talk to Dennis Cheng, it is often as close as you get to talking to Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cHe has just been with her for such a long time,\u201d said one New York Democrat who has raised over $100,000 for the campaign. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy who moved seamlessly with her over to the State Department, who moved seamlessly over to the foundation. People perceive that making Dennis happy is making Hillary happy, and there are only a handful of people in that orbit you can say that about.\u201d\n\nCheng came into politics after graduating from Swarthmore College, where he founded the school\u2019s mock trial club and sent the team to the national championships, where Cheng \u201cdefended\u201d a fictitious crew of rescued Mt. Everest climbers accused of eating one of their own fallen comrades. (They came in 10th place.)\n\nHe interned for Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate run, and, after a stint at the London School of Economics, he worked on Wesley Clark\u2019s and John Kerry\u2019s presidential campaigns, before coming over to Hillary Clinton\u2019s side in the run-up to her 2006 re-election to the Senate.\n\nAnd by her side he has largely stayed. During the 2008 campaign, he served as New York finance director, and now serves as one of the few veterans of both that doomed effort and the new campaign.\n\n\u201cThat was not a highly functioning place to work,\u201d recalled one former Clinton staffer. \u201cHe was probably the most functioning guy there. The only one that seemed like he was on top of his shit.\u201d\n\nFrom there, Cheng went to work under Clinton at the State Department, where, as deputy chief of protocol, his job was largely to make sure that the proper red carpets were rolled out for visiting dignitaries, and that all scheduled events and meetings go off as planned. He then went to the Clinton Foundation, where in four short years he helped raise a quarter of a billion dollars as the organization was ramping up its efforts before the launch of Hillary\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cHe is someone who knows way too much to remain in the shadows,\u201d said Keith Appell, a Republican public relations guru who worked in 2004 with the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth and whose firm is helping advise the group releasing undercover videos of Planned Parenthood officials discussing the sale of fetal tissue.\n\nNow he wants Congress to bring Cheng up to Capitol Hill to ask him about the overlap of these various Clinton ventures.\n\n\u201cIt is not hard to understand. What you have to do is make the connection between the potential sale of influence by Hillary Clinton and her questionable record as Secretary of State as it relates to the safety and security of the United States. You can anticipate one line of attack to be, \u2018Mrs. Clinton couldn\u2019t keep four of her closest associates safe in Benghazi, how is she going to keep the rest of the United States safe.\u2019 Oh, and she is in bed with unsavory characters and taking their money. This is not a hard connection to make and Cheng is at the center of it.\u201d\n\nPart of the coming focus on Cheng, Republicans say, is the hope that if they kick up enough dirt it will begin to make donors think twice about giving to Clinton. So far, at least, those hopes have not been realized. The $47 million that the campaign raised in the first quarter was a record for a non-incumbent, and one that was even more impressive considering that they have only been raising money for the primary in order to avoid seeming over-confident.\n\nThe key to Clinton\u2019s record-breaking early hauls, Clinton aides and fundraisers say, is an approach instituted by Cheng that mirrors the data-heavy, no-drama tactics of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, instead of the chaos of her own effort. Then, fundraisers who worked for the Clintons say the finance team spent endless hours on the phone schmoozing with donors while the needs of the actual fundraising staff stationed around the country went largely ignored. Now, one veteran of both campaigns told The Daily Beast, \u201cIf I call, Dennis calls me back within the hour. Now don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014he only spends three minutes on the phone with me, but he calls me back right away.\u201d\n\nDespite all the focus on online fundraising over the last several cycles, campaigns still largely raise money the way they have for generations: getting their most committed supporters to \u201cbundle\u201d money together from their well-off friends.\n\nSince donations are strictly capped, the more you bundle, the more you rise in the fundraising hierarchy, and the more likely you are to get your phone calls returned from the candidate. In 2008, new donors were often \u201cclaimed\u201d by multiple bundlers as being \u201ctheirs,\u201d a practice that was encouraged by the campaign.\n\nNo more. Instead, bundlers are largely limited to only count toward their total someone they personally solicited to give. The new system fosters more competition, as fundraisers have to hunt the dollars on their own, rather than rely on their own network of bundlers. A computerized system keeps the whole apparatus in place. The directives are clear.\n\n\u201cFrom the first day he gave us pretty clear marching orders,\u201d said one donor. \u201cTen checks of $2,700 in the first 30 days. If you wanted to be a part of it, you had to step up. There are very clear benchmarks.\u201d\n\nIn order to be on the finance team, you have to bring in the money. No one is grandfathered in due to a long relationship with the Clintons, and titles, roles, and recognition are kept to a minimum.\n\n\u201cYou are dealing with some fairly significant personalities here, people at the highest levels of entertainment and business,\u201d said Tom Nides, a colleague of Cheng\u2019s at the State Department and a Clinton adviser. \u201cThese people wanted to be treated well, but you need to send a message too. Hillary has a lot of friends, but they are going to be treated equally. You want to see who is going to produce.\u201d\n\nOr, as another top New York donor put it, \u201cYou can\u2019t really make it into Hillary\u2019s inner circle at this point. All you can do is raise a lot of money and make Dennis happy.\u201d\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:23.650+0000"}
{"entityId": 1744, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A more moderate nominee could take the abortion fight to the Democrats. But with numerous hopefuls embracing \u2018no exceptions,\u2019 the GOP can\u2019t turn the issue to their advantage in 2016.\n\nWhere do Americans stand on abortion? Well, they don\u2019t so much \u201cstand\u201d as they do muddle in the middle. The latest Gallup poll says 50 percent of Americans call themselves \u201cpro-choice\u201d; 44 percent \u201cpro-life.\u201d (That\u2019s a slight change toward the \u201cpro-choice\u201d position.)\n\nBut probe a little deeper, and it depends on how you ask the question. A CBS poll last March found 38 percent saying it should be \u201cgenerally available,\u201d 34 percent favored \u201cstricter limits,\u201d and 25 percent said it should be not available at all. A recent Pew summary found Americans were \u201croughly divided\u201d on the issue\u201451 percent saying it should permitted in \u201call or most cases, with 43 percent saying it should not be allowed in all or most cases. And that same Gallup poll that showed movement toward the \u201cpro-choice\u201d view also found that a majority favored \u201cmore restrictions\u201d on the practice.\n\nYet while the public continues to embrace several shades of gray, the two political parties have moved steadily toward more and more absolutist positions, while excising from their platforms any acknowledgment of those holding different views. As the recent Republican TV debate showed, this has the potential to cause real trouble for several of the Presidential contenders, with at least three\u2014Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and Mike Huckabee\u2014rejecting the \u201crape or incest\u201d exemption an overwhelming majority of Americans favor. (So do others who weren\u2019t asked\u2014Ted Cruz and Rick Santorum among them.)\n\nThere is, moreover, a case to be made that if the Republicans nominate a candidate with such views, it might spare the Democratic nominee from answering troublesome questions about the party\u2019s own positions.\n\nSome history charts the respective movements of the two parties. In 1976, the Republican platform took no position at all, but simply acknowledged that the issue \u201cis one of the most difficult and controversial of our time.\u201d\n\nFour years later, the GOP came down in favor of a \u201chuman life\u201d constitutional amendment, while recognizing \u201cdiffering views.\u201d By 1984\u2014and ever since\u2014Republicans were insisting that \u201cThe unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed.\u201d Any nod toward differing views has long since vanished. (Back in 1996, nominee Bob Dole tried in vain to soften the plank.)\n\nThe 2012 version also calls for Roe v. Wade to be overturned, and for the appointment of judges who support this view. Read literally, the GOP platform would forbid all abortions, even to save the life of the mother. (James Bopp, the drafter of the language, suggests a mother should be allowed to save her life with an abortion under a \u201cself-defense\u201d theory.)\n\nThere\u2019s one key footnote to this; Republican presidential candidates have openly disagreed with this absolutist view\u2014George W. Bush among them. They have suffered no political damage within the party (unless you count Mike Huckabee\u2019s victory over Mitt Romney in the 2008 Iowa caucuses).\n\nBut this year, that distancing may not come cost free. In the March \u201cSEC primaries,\u201d eight Southern states will cast their votes, and candidates will face a GOP electorate where a significant majority declare themselves \u201cborn-again\u201d Christians. Back in 2012, Santorum won 11 primaries, running as a social conservative opposed to virtually all abortions. For those Republicans with more nuanced positions\u2014Jeb Bush, John Kasich\u2014this could be a major problem. But for those embracing the \u201cno exceptions\u201d approach, what aids them in Dixie in March could be fatal nationwide in November.\n\nRead literally, the GOP platform would forbid all abortions, even to save the life of the mother.\n\nWhat about the Democrats? Their platform has embraced the essentials of the \u201cpro-choice\u201d position for the better part of four decades. (Back in 1992, Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey was barred from even addressing the Democratic convention to argue for a pro-life position.) But up until 2012, it framed the issue the way Bill Clinton had: that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal\u2014and rare.\u201d\n\nIn Charlotte, that last caveat was erased. As it now stands, the platform simply asserts that \u201cThe Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman\u2019s right to make decisions regarding her pregnancy, including a safe and legal abortion, regardless of ability to pay. We oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right.\u201d\n\nRead literally, this would permit abortions\u2014paid for with public funds if necessary\u2014for any abortion at any time for any reason. This is a view that the great majority of Americans reject.\n\nIt\u2019s also a position that seems out of pace with the views of one Democrat in particular\u2014Hillary Rodham Clinton. Over the years, she\u2019s made it clear that she regards abortion as something other than a triumph for women\u2019s empowerment. She said in 2008 that \u201cI believe that the potential for life begins at conception,\u201d while also arguing that it was not the government\u2019s place to enforce such a view. She\u2019s said, \u201cWe can all recognize that abortion in many ways represents a sad, even tragic choice to many, many women,\u201d and that she respects \u201cthose who believe that there are no circumstances under which any abortion should ever be available.\u201d She\u2019s often urged a move toward \u201ccommon ground,\u201d arguing that better access to birth control would reduce the number of abortions.\n\nFor some feminists, these views are unpopular. To call abortion a \u201csad tragic choice,\u201d they argue, suggests that there\u2019s something morally troubling about the practice, rather than the exercise of a fundamental personal right. To assert that it should be \u201crare\u2014very rare,\u201d as Clinton has done, is to cast the practice in a \u201cnegative light.\u201d (See this Guardian piece for a sample of such arguments.)\n\nIf the surveys are right, that\u2019s exactly how most Americans do view abortion: as a procedure that the law must allow, under many or most conditions, but one that inevitably raises hard questions about when and why a \u201cpotential human\u201d life can be ended\u2014especially as that \u201cpotential\u201d life begins more and more to resemble a human being. It\u2019s why there\u2019s a massive majority behind \u201cmorning after\u201d pills, and abortions early in the gestation period, and big majorities opposed to late-term abortions. (It\u2019s also why in most \u201cadvanced\u201d countries, abortions are subject to a range of restrictions after three or four months.)\n\nIn another time, a Republican candidate with a position like the one George W. Bush held might find some room to press the Democrat\u2014OK, let\u2019s assume it\u2019s Clinton\u2014on her views. \u201cI disagree with my party\u2019s platform, I favor exceptions,\u201d this theoretical candidate could say. \u201cDo you agree with your party that abortion should be permitted at any time for any reason? You\u2019ve called those Planned Parenthood videos \u2018disturbing.\u2019 I find them disturbing too, for the casual way they deal with what you\u2019ve called \u2018potential human life.\u2019\u201d\n\nBut with the Republicans more and more embracing the most rigid possible position on the pro-life side of the divide, the more it will relieve the Democratic nominee of the need to defend the absolutist posture on her side.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:23.794+0000"}

How the billionaire egoist is the creation of the network now trying to destroy him.\n\nOkay, so as I write these words, someone could be about to release a post-debate poll showing exactly what establishment Washington, which now apparently includes even Fox News (!), yearns to see a poll show\u2014that Donald Trump has tumbled, and that the new leaders in the GOP field are the comparatively sober Jeb Bush and John Kasich, along with maybe Carly Fiorina, since everybody seems to be swooning over her now. Maybe it\u2019ll happen.\n\nBut what in fact did happen is that we got this NBC News-Survey Monkey poll showing Trump still ahead and Ted Cruz and Ben Carson vaulting into second and third place, respectively. It\u2019s an online poll, and I know we\u2019re supposed to question its methodology (which the pollsters explain here, if you\u2019re interested). So I\u2019m not going to sit here and swear by it. But on Monday, two other post-debate polls came along showing that Trump is still going strong. So the results are interesting enough, and they track closely enough with other anecdotal evidence that\u2019s made its way to my inbox, that it\u2019s certainly worth asking: What if Trump is still clobbering the rest of the GOP field?\n\nIf he is, we\u2019re at a very interesting politico-cultural moment: The moment when, to a sizeable portion of the GOP electorate, Fox News stopped being their warrior and instead became just another arm of the lamestream media. If that\u2019s true, everything we\u2019ve known and assumed about our political divide is now moot, and we\u2019re flying totally blind. The Republican Party has unleashed furies it can no longer remotely control.\n\nFirst, here are the numbers, if you haven\u2019t seen them. Post-poll, Trump went to 23 percent, according to NBC. That\u2019s actually a gain of one statistically insignificant point, but reflect on this: He gained that point even though poll respondents said by a huge margin that he lost the debate (29 percent called him the loser; next closest was Rand Paul at 14 percent). Ted Cruz gained seven points, going from 6 to 13 percent. Ben Carson gained three points, moving from 8 to 11 percent. Marco Rubio stayed flat at 8 percent, and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, the other \u201cfirst-tier\u201d candidates, finished in the cellar, losing three points each.\n\nSo add it up. The Tasmanian Devil candidate who\u2019s obviously tapping into deep right-wing anti-establishment anger and the two other most extreme candidates combine for 47 percent. The two who in my view you can reasonably call quasi- or comparatively moderate, Kasich and Bush, combine to hit 9 percent.\n\nAll right, though, enough on the polls. Maybe enough time hasn\u2019t elapsed for Trump\u2019s Megyn Kelly comments to truly sink in with the Republican electorate. But here\u2019s the anecdotal materials that suggests he\u2019s still on the rise. First, which candidates were most heavily Googled during the debate? Huh. What a coincidence. It was Trump, Carson, and Cruz. The biggest single Google moment by a mile came during Cruz\u2019s first remarks (\u201cIf you\u2019re looking for someone to go to Washington, to go along to get along, to get\u2014to agree with the career politicians in both parties who get in bed with the lobbyists and special interests, then I ain\u2019t your guy.\u201d) Carson scored well while talking terrorism and during his close, and Trump throughout.\n\nHere\u2019s a little more. I was on Fox on Sunday, on Howard Kurtz\u2019s show. Every time I finish that show, I have 30 or so tweets in my feed. Usually, the tweeters are angry at me, for the obvious reasons. But Sunday, they were mostly mad at The Blaze\u2019s Amy Holmes for her robust defenses of Megyn Kelly and attacks on Trump. This tweet, while more polite than most, is representative of the argument. Trump isn\u2019t perfect, but lay off him already. Fox screwed up. And most of all: Don\u2019t tell us what to think!\n\nWhen you spend years nodding and winking and yuk-yuking about the president\u2019s birth certificate, how can you be surprised when the guy who has repeatedly demanded to see it turns out to be really popular with your base?\n\nWe\u2019re used to this kind of rhetoric when conservatives volley it in the direction of The New York Times and CNN. But what are we to make of it when the target is Fox?\n\nTwo things. First, if I\u2019m right about this and other polls back all this up, this process is officially beyond anyone\u2019s ability to predict. Ignore all \u201csurely this will finally start Trump\u2019s downfall\u201d stories, and all positive Jeb! stories. And is Cruz soon-to-be first tier? I admit that I sure missed that. I didn\u2019t think he registered a heartbeat in the debate. It\u2019s hardly remarkable that I was wrong about something, but most commentators pretty much dismissed Cruz, too.\n\nAnd Carson! It\u2019s not like he comes out of nowhere. They\u2019ve been selling his first book by the truckful in Christian bookstores for years, and for gosh sakes, Cuba Gooding Jr. played him in a movie. But normally that would translate into a respectable sixth or seventh place. If he\u2019s really doing better than that, something important has changed. And don\u2019t ignore what an extremist he is: In his more recent book, which I actually read, he sincerely questioned whether citizens who pay no net income tax should have the right to vote\u2014\u201cSerious problems arise when a person who pays nothing has the right to vote and determine what other people are paying.\u201d\n\nThe second thing we\u2019re to make of this is that Fox and the Republican Party have created this new reality. When you spend years nodding and winking and yuk-yuking about the President\u2019s birth certificate, how can you be surprised when the guy who has repeatedly demanded to see it turns out to be really popular with your base? You promote a politics that attacks women not merely for having abortions but for wanting to use contraception, and then you\u2019re shocked when your hard-shell voting base turns out not to be overly offended by remarks like Trump\u2019s?\n\nIndeed Roger Ailes recognized all this when he decided to make nice with Trump on Monday. In the first instance Ailes did it because Trump has leverage, and The Donald\u2019s threat not to go on his air meant a heavy hit in the ratings department. Ailes was also certainly feeling the blowback from his core audience--the kinds of tweets I alluded to above. And beyond all that, somewhere deeper down, Ailes knows that Fox made Trump, politically, and that the two are made for each other.\n\nThe Republican Party and Fox permitted and encouraged Trumpian vitriol for years. All that talk over the years about birth certificates and Kenya and terrorist fist-jabs (remember that one?!) and the moocher class and the scary brown people and all the rest of it...all of it created a need for a Trump, and for other Trump-like candidates, to flourish. Now it threatens to overtake them. If they\u2019re wondering who created Trumpism, I have someplace they can look.

As the old joke has it, you root for a plane crash (relax, it\u2019s a joke).\n\nThis is kind of where I am as I watch this blood feud erupt between the National Review Online and the Trump loyalists who started the #NRORevolt hashtag over the weekend. If you missed it, here\u2019s the sitch. Last Friday, subscribers to Jonah Goldberg\u2019s NR newsletter, the G-file, found his latest in their in-boxes, a protracted jeremiad that ran under the title \u201cNo Movement That Embraces Trump Can Call Itself Conservative.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf this is the conservative movement now,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI guess you\u2019re going to have to count me out.\u201d\n\nSo Trump partisans started doing exactly that, and in droves. Commenters on the article were venomous: Go ahead, you RINO-quisling-sellout (or, occasionally, you dastardly Jew), who needs you anyway? This comment was representative, and even a little quasi-poetic: \u201cSo Blow and Rage, Jonah, Blow into the winter night, strut and fret your rabid slobber onto the stage, idiot-like until you are flattened by the Trump steamroller\u2014of course we will be forced to hear more of your shout and flabberting, but it won\u2019t mean a thing. I hope the Republican Party collapses so we can get on with partnering with something that is not so diseased that its internal organs are melting into a pus-fulled [sic] syrup that is oozing out of every\u2026whatever.\u201d\n\nWhat better entertainment could there possibly be than watching American conservatism being wrecked by a bunch of white nationalists?\n\nIn short order, the now-famous hashtag arose as a venue for kindred sentiments. It seems safe to say that not many National Review subscribers are probably involved in this effort. As near as these things can be determined, it may have been launched by a guy named Ricky Vaughn, who describes himself on Twitter as a \u201cright-wing nativist.\u201d You see the word \u201ccuckservative\u201d tossed around a lot in these tweets, a word that the Southern Poverty Law Center says has roots in white nationalist and anti-Semitic circles. And of course the word sounds the way it sounds for a reason, evoking both \u201ccock\u201d and \u201csuck\u201d in a way that is definitely not intended as a compliment.\n\nWell, for people like me, this is definitely pass-the-popcorn time. What better entertainment could there possibly be than watching American conservatism being wrecked by a bunch of white nationalists?\n\nAmerican conservatism has spent decades winking at these kinds of groups and voters\u2014denouncing them very occasionally when caught red-handed playing in the same sandbox, as when a white Southern Republican is forced to explain that gosh, he didn\u2019t know the local citizens\u2019 council was a white supremacist group; but for the most part courting these voters and stoking their anxieties through means sometimes subtle, sometimes not. So, let them tear each other apart.\n\nThe amusing thing is, Goldberg actually makes some good points in his newsletter piece, mainly that Trump isn\u2019t much of a conservative on a number of issues. About that, he is correct.\n\nBut if he can\u2019t instantly grasp how modern conservatism made Trump\u2014and not only Trump, but even more important, the people who are now his rabid supporters\u2014then I doubt it can be explained at a level of remediation that will sink in. But it\u2019s pretty simple. When Steve King jokes about people crossing the border with their cantaloupe-sized calves full of bags of weed, he\u2019s creating Trump and Trump\u2019s backers. And multiply that times 300 for every crazy-borderline racist comment in recent years by Michele Bachmann and Rush Limbaugh and all the rest of them, and you get a party and a movement whose nudges at that kind of thing have done far more to create Trump and his supporters than the occasional faux-solemn and perfunctory denunciations have done to thwart them. So this problem of white nationalism bubbling uncomfortably close to the surface is one the Republican Party and the conservative movement have deserved to have for a long time now.\n\nMind you I don\u2019t think liberals should be gloating too much about this yet. It\u2019s way too hard to predict what all this will mean for the election. In all likelihood, Trump won\u2019t have the votes to win the nomination, John Kasich or Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush will, and the Trump voters will mostly start getting themselves worked up about the looming menace of President Hillary and come out and vote for the sellout RINOs they\u2019re now repudiating at #NRORevolt.\n\nBut let\u2019s say that at some point, we do see a real civil war in the Republican Party over all this, and the time comes when GOP leaders need to own up to a Joe McCarthy kind of moment\u2014that is, a moment when they are finally forced to step forward and say, Donald, we don\u2019t want you or your more extreme supporters. The National Review itself did a version of this, of course, back in the old days under Bill Buckley, when it said much the same to John Birch Society types.\n\nBut the Review was just a magazine. It lost some subscribers, I\u2019m sure, but not the White House. For a political party the stakes are a little higher, and I don\u2019t think today\u2019s GOP would have the stones to do it. The party is stuck with Trump and his backers. It created them.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:24.379+0000"}

Iowa State Senator Tony Bisignano says he would rather Biden decide to run and not bother with the draft, that Iowa needs him to get people interested and young people excited. Bisignano has supported Biden since his first run for the presidency in 1988, and again in 2008. \u201cI\u2019ve taken him everywhere from the state fair to church. Everyone loves Joe.\u201d A recent Quinnipiac poll of Iowa Democratic caucus goers puts Biden\u2019s favorability rating at 79 percent. Even with the Secret Service, Bisignano notes that Biden is able to \u201cbust loose.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not having a contest, we\u2019re having a coronation,\u201d Bisignano says, and that\u2019s a hardship for Iowa Democrats. With a Republican governor, two Republican senators, and a Republican House, the only body the Democrats control is the Iowa Senate, and that\u2019s by the closest of margins (26\u201324). To build excitement, they need competition. \u201cI don\u2019t think Clinton\u2019s brief appearances here are going to cut it,\u201d says Bisignano.\n\nIowa Democrat Jim Lykam agrees, that\u2019s why he agreed to sign a letter along with several other Iowa lawmakers urging Biden to run.\n\nLykam, a longtime Biden supporter, said when the veep is in town Biden will have the Secret Service call ahead that he wants to see Lykam, which makes the eight-term Davenport lawmaker feel pretty special. In their last conversation about 2016, Biden said, \u201cJim, you\u2019re going to be one of the first to know,\u201d a promise the veep no doubt has made to countless others who consider him their friend.\n\nPrimary fights can get very bitter and personal, yet what\u2019s most striking about the Draft Biden effort is how civil everything seems to be, at least so far. If Biden declines to get into the race, Draft Biden \u201816 will support Clinton, no question. The doubts that emerge around Clinton for these Democrats center on her struggle to relate to voters in the same way her husband is able to do, and that Biden does so easily.\n\n\u201cFor her, it\u2019s like having to join a fraternity or a sorority, there\u2019s pledge week and hell week,\u201d says Dick Harpootlian, former Democratic Party chairman in South Carolina, who tells of taking six hours to play golf with Biden because the veep felt an obligation to chat up everyone on the course.\n\n\u201cHe relates to everybody,\u201d says Harpootlian, who is advising Draft Biden \u201916.\n\nOnce a self-described \u201cvociferous\u201d Clinton supporter\u2014he went door-to-door in New Hampshire with Bill in \u201992\u2014he chose Obama in early \u201907 despite his historical ties with the Clintons. \u201cIt\u2019s more than charisma; it\u2019s more than the ability to emote; it\u2019s the ability to speak to 25,000 people and have every one of them feel you\u2019re speaking to them. Clinton had it, Bush had it, Obama had it, Reagan had it. Joe Biden has it\u2014he can bring people to tears.

It is also hard to believe that so many women are also paid less than many for the same work, with even wider gaps for women of color,\u201d Clinton said to sustained applause. \u201cAnd if you don\u2019t believe what I say, look to the World Economic Forum, hardly a hotbed of feminist thought. Their rankings show that the United States is 65th out of 142 nations and other territories on equal pay.\n\n\u201cWe should be No. 1.\u201d\n\nClinton placed women\u2019s struggle for equality within the struggle for a more equal economic playing field, pointing out that the lack of parity on wages meant that families had less to spend on education, health care, and retirement.\n\n\u201cWhen women are held back, our country is held back. When women get ahead, everyone gets ahead,\u201d Clinton said.\n\n\u201cOur mothers and sisters and daughters are on the front lines of all of these battles,\u201d Clinton added later. \u201cBut these are not just women\u2019s fights. These have to be America\u2019s fights and the world\u2019s fights. We have to take them on, we have to win them together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are those who offer themselves as leaders who see nothing wrong with denying women equal pay.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd although it remains unclear what role her husband, Bill Clinton, will play in her presidential campaign, two other figures of the extended Clinton family may get top billing: her baby granddaughter, who was mentioned 90 seconds into Clinton\u2019s speech and brought up several times thereafter, and Clinton\u2019s own mother.\n\nDorothy Rodham, as Clinton described her, survived a difficult childhood by relying on the kindness of strangers and acquaintances. She died in 2011 at 92.\n\n\u201cHow could you have survived?\u201d Clinton asked. \u201cHow could you have built a family of your own, taking such good care of your children?\u201d\n\nThe speech was part of the Women in the World Summit, hosted by Daily Beast founding editor Tina Brown, and will last three days at the David Koch Theater at Lincoln Center.\n\nJust as in Clinton\u2019s announcement video, which seemed to include all manner of member of the Democratic coalition\u2014a gay couple readying to marry, a senior citizen preparing to retire, an immigrant entrepreneur starting a new business\u2014Clinton paid tribute to the vast mosaic of issues that face womenkind, including gay and transgender women, undocumented women (she called directly for a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d), and women facing sexual assault on campus and in the military. She mentioned the legions of fast-food workers who went on strike and marched in the streets last week in the fight for a higher minimum wage, and she drew parallels between that fight and the fight for greater equality that she witnessed around the world as first lady and later secretary of state.\n\nClinton also made a thundering denunciation of unnamed Republican opponents, whom she accused of stalling women\u2019s progress.\n\n\u201cWe have to have leaders who recognize that the time has come. There are those who offer themselves as leaders who take a very different view,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThere are those who offer themselves as leaders who see nothing wrong with denying women equal pay. There are those who offer themselves as leaders who would defund the country\u2019s leading provider of family planning and want to let health insurance companies once again charge women just because of our gender. There are those who offer themselves as leaders who deport mothers working to give their children a better life rather than face the ire of talk radio. There are those who offer themselves as leaders who would even play politics with the nomination of our nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.\u201d\n\nWhen Obama would succumb to such rhetorical flourishes, he would often reference the grand sweep of history that saw rebels overthrow the British, settlers set out for the West, slaves run away for their freedom, immigrants sail for unknown shores, and African Americans conduct lunch counter sit-ins in the segregated South. That sweep included voters going to the polls to make history themselves and vote for him as president.\n\nAt Lincoln Center, Clinton said much the same thing.\n\n\u201cBy coming here and being a part of this extraordinary conference, you now must be an agent of change, as well,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt is up to all of us to be part of the progress we want to see.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am confident,\u201d she added, \u201cthat if we get to work, we will get it done, together.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:26.644+0000"}

If Marco Rubio doesn\u2019t get that, he won\u2019t go very far.\n\nOn the surface, Marco Rubio is such a perfect 2016 Republican nominee you might think he was created in a lab. He ticks off all the demographic boxes that the GOP has struggled with for the past decade: A young (43) Latino who likes Tupac! He is adept with social media, talks like a person who watches the same dumb TV as you, and is pleasantly self-deprecatory when the occasion calls for it. Pundits and consultants are giddy with the prospect of a \u201cgenerational choice\u201d between Rubio and the rest of the field\u2014not to mention Hillary Clinton.\n\nAnalysts aren\u2019t wrong to suppose that a race against Rubio, in either the primary or the general, will expose a generational fault line. But it\u2019s far from certain that Rubio will be one with the youth vote on his side.\n\nTake away Rubio\u2019s biography and look at his positions and he becomes less the voice of his generation and more Benjamin Button. If I told you about a candidate that was anti-marriage equality, anti-immigration reform (for now), anti-pot decriminalization, pro-government surveillance, and in favor of international intervention but against doing something about climate change, what would you guess the candidate\u2019s age to be? On all of those issues, Rubio\u2019s position is not the one shared by most young people. The Guardian dubbed him the \u201cJohn McCain of the millennial set,\u201d which isn\u2019t fair to McCain, who at least has averred that climate change exists.\n\nWinning \u201cthe youth vote\u201d in Florida amounts to sweeping the retirement communities rather than the nursing homes.\n\nIndeed, with those opinions, the only demographic Rubio can plausibly claim to represent is old white guys. Well, even old white guys support marriage equality these days\u201463 percent of all Americans do. But Rubio has the olds on other issues! Americans 65 and older are the only age group with a majority against marijuana decriminalization and the only group who deny anthropogenic climate change; those 50 and older are the only group with a majority that believes the government surveillance \u201chas not gone far enough.\u201d\n\nAdvisers have bragged that, unlike other candidates, Rubio would not be \u201ccompeting for who can be the whitest, oldest rich guy,\u201d a claim which is both obvious and beside the point. Of course, he\u2019s not competing to be a rich old white guy, but he\u2019d be a fool not to be competing for the whitest, oldest rich guys. Staking his nomination on the non-white or youth voters of the Republican Party would be a comically doomed strategy: The GOP primary electorate is 95 percent white. In every state with an early primary (Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida), over half of those who cast Republican votes are over the age of 50. (In Florida, 70 percent of primary voters are over 50.)\n\nIndeed, the Rubio team\u2019s assuredness about his youthful appeal may come from the fact that they\u2019re all in Florida. Winning \u201cthe youth vote\u201d in Florida amounts to sweeping the retirement communities rather than the nursing homes.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Rubio has competition to be one of the non-whitest, youngest guys in the GOP\u2019s crowded field: There is at least one honorary Hispanic (Jeb Bush) and one black candidate (Ben Carson), and several who are close to Rubio in age: Scott Walker (47), Rand Paul (52), Ted Cruz (44).\n\nThe redeeming quality of Rubio\u2019s \u201cyouth strategy\u201d\u2014why it just might work!\u2014is that it is fundamentally insincere. Which is to say, he\u2019s not competing for the youth vote at all\u2014he\u2019s competing for the old rich white guys who think they know what the youth of the country want.\n\nAll those electoral post-mortems have apparently convinced at least a few of the GOP\u2019s decision-makers that they are no longer the most influential demographic in America. But they didn\u2019t finish reading those reports, I guess, because they don\u2019t seem to realize why they aren\u2019t as influential. They think it\u2019s just about age and race, and so we get Republicans in mid-life-crisis mode, without thinking through what issues made young people reject them.\n\nThis is the latest in conservative identity politics, a facile assumption that all you need to do to win someone\u2019s vote is to run someone that looks a little like them. But millennials in particular have proven to be demographic-agnostic when it comes to picking their heroes and spokespeople. They\u2019ve made meme-worthy icons of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Betty White. A recent survey found that the business person millennials most admire to be Bill Gates (59), not Mark Zuckerberg. In politics, it was John F. Kennedy, who might considered permanently young, but he surely doesn\u2019t represent the future.\n\nAs far attracting young voters, Rubio\u2019s campaign will probably go about as well as most old-people-try-to-guess-what-the-young-people-want strategies go. Marco Rubio is the GOP\u2019s Cousin Oliver, a desperate gimmick by the out-of-touch to spark interest in a moribund brand. That Rubio is a gleeful participant in this exercise makes his distance from the actual dreams and desires of this country\u2019s young people all the more apparent.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:26.912+0000"}

Except it would be a disaster if it did.\n\nBernie Sanders is the Left\u2019s Donald Trump.\n\nBear with me here. There is a lot they don\u2019t have in common, including where they stand in their respective party\u2019s polls\u2014though Sanders\u2019s slow creep into a distant second is likely to be more sustainable. Still, they have both managed to disrupt their respective nomination races, and they\u2019ve done that because they both have a similar appeal: They\u2019ve tapped into anti-establishment passions with rhetoric that is a kind of wish-fulfillment fantasy for some voters. \u201cHe has the guts to say what others won\u2019t\u201d could be the slogan for either of them.\n\nI don\u2019t want to gloss over the content of that gut-driven bluntness. In Trump\u2019s case, just because he\u2019s saying what others won\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean what he\u2019s saying is true. And it\u2019s fair to point out that Trump\u2019s lowest-common-denominator xenophobia is a sugar high kind populism: it\u2019s cheap and easily reproduced but difficult to sustain. Sanders, on the other hand, offers a chewier and less visceral version of \u201cus-versus-them\u201d: Discussions about income inequality and financial regulatory policy don\u2019t create the same kind of direct line to voters\u2019 emotions that Trump\u2019s talk of rapists and thieves travels on.\n\nThe media is covering them in a similar fashion, too, though that\u2019s mainly a function of how the political media cover campaigns in general. The story is the process, not the messages or ideas. \u201cAnalysis\u201d consists of asking, \u201cWhat this will do the race?\u201d and not, \u201cWhat does it mean for voters?\u201d Granted, only one of the candidates in question has ideas to cover. Indeed, Sanders\u2019s reliance on a few big ideas\u2014not personality, not easy outrage\u2014is one of the reasons coverage of his rise has an element of arch bemusement. Note The New York Times: \u201cSomehow, Bernie Sanders, the 73-year-old senator from Vermont, has emerged as a king of social media.\u201d Somehow!\n\n\u201cI think we need to just cut to the chase and have a real libertarian/conservative go up against Elizabeth Warren or avowed socialist Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nTrump coverage, of course, is more straightforwardly mocking (I highly recommend the Trump Chrome extension). While everyone wonders what Trump\u2019s rise might do to the GOP race, no one is wondering how it is he got as far as he did. Just ask any of the other, \u201cmore serious\u201d candidates, whose reluctance to criticize Trump proves that his only real divergence from the Republican mainstream is stylistic, not substantive.\n\nOn the other hand, there are real policy differences between Sanders and the Democratic leadership\u2014that\u2019s why he wasn\u2019t a Democrat until recently, after all. Moderate Democrats have been denouncing Sanders with a vigor conspicuously absent from the intraparty Trump conversation: Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill complained, \u201cI very rarely read in any coverage of Bernie that he\u2019s a socialist\u201d and declared him \u201ctoo liberal\u201d to be president.\n\nPut it another way: When Democratic base voters flock to Sanders, they are expressing dissatisfaction what current Democratic policies. When Republican base voters flock to Trump, they are expressing dissatisfaction with Republican rhetoric.\n\nBut I said I was going to talk about what they had in common, and that\u2019s easy enough here: Whether it\u2019s rhetorically or policy-wise, Trump and Sanders supporters are asking their parties to move away from the center\u2014or, perhaps more clearly stated, away from each other.\n\nIndeed, there are those on both sides who long for a Trump-Sanders match-up. It would, on some level, be a battle of caricatures\u2014as defined by the opposing side. And what about the Democrats who would love to see Trump get the nomination? And Republicans who\u2019d like to see Sanders? They envision that contest as referendum more than an election, a chance to finally and fatally eject the other side from the political spectrum. As Glenn Beck put it recently: \u201cI think we need to just cut to the chase and have a real libertarian/conservative go up against Elizabeth Warren or avowed socialist Bernie Sanders. This country could finally make up its mind based on two honest and completely different visions of the future of this country.\u201d\n\nA nation born of revolution is given to absolutes, of course. (\u201cGive me liberty or give me death,\u201d no middle ground, etc.) But the Founders never thought we\u2019d be using those words against each other. Beck and others frame the prospect of two extremists as a contest of \u201cvisions\u201d but both sides are actually colorblind: Everything is black and white. One side is totally wrong; one side is totally right. This zero-sum mentality and vengeful nihilism threaten to turn government into just another WWE show, a cage match of ideologies.\n\nLeft unspoken in these hyperbolic hypotheticals is what happens if the other guy\u2019s caricature wins. That 50-50 chance of total validation is just too blinding, I guess. But what happens if their own caricature wins, more often than not, is just as vague. It\u2019s standard practice to snigger when asking a supporter of a fringe candidate (though neither Trump nor Sanders are really fringe) what will happen were their dream president actually to sit down in the Oval Office. The objectively ridiculous proposition of a President Sanders or a President Trump actually trying to govern is supposed to destabilize the fantasy.\n\nBut the attraction of a Sanders or Trump presidency for true believers isn\u2019t the opportunity to govern all of us, but the chance to punish the rest of us.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:27.147+0000"}
{"entityId": 1752, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Obama\u2019s deal with Tehran is beyond awful, but something along the lines of what he laid out in 2013 could have brought lasting peace.\n\nTo understand which side emerged victorious from the Iran talks, look no further than the words of President Obama himself. Back in December of 2013, President Obama spoke to the Saban Forum on the topic of Iran.\n\n\u201c[W]e can envision a comprehensive agreement that involves extraordinary constraints and verification mechanisms and intrusive inspections, but that permits Iran to have a peaceful nuclear program,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow, in terms of specifics, we know that they don\u2019t need to have an underground, fortified facility like Fordor [sic] in order to have a peaceful nuclear program. They certainly don\u2019t need a heavy-water reactor at Arak in order to have a peaceful nuclear program. They don\u2019t need some of the advanced centrifuges that they currently possess in order to have a limited, peaceful nuclear program.\u201d\n\nThe president was correct at the time. And that is why it is so disconcerting that, under the announced terms of the proposed nuclear deal, the Iranians will retain every single one of these assets and capabilities. What\u2019s more, they will now retain them with the explicit support and cooperation of the United States, receiving relief from the major point of leverage that brought them to the table, and possibly sparking a nuclear arms race that will now extend across the Middle East, to Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nYou cannot blame Iran for openly gloating about this\u2014their surrogates, Hamas and Hezbollah, are rejoicing as well. The Iranians believe they are walking away from the negotiations with nearly everything they wanted. They are getting immediate sanctions relief. They get to keep their facility deep underneath a mountain, the one likely able to withstand any ground-penetrating munitions, and they\u2019re fine keeping a smaller amount of centrifuges, at least for the time being.\n\nThat last point may seem counterintuitive, until you understand that Iran is not interested in building a peaceful nuclear power program\u2014they\u2019re building a nuclear weapons program. If they wanted the former and not the latter, their priorities would be completely different. As former CIA deputy director Michael Morell and other experts have noted, the centrifuge capacity required to enrich enough material for nuclear power, to fuel a reactor over the course of the year, is very significant; the capacity needed to create a nuclear weapon is much less.\n\nNow the very leverage that brought Iran to the negotiating table has been squandered, and is never returning.\n\nThe White House doesn\u2019t seem to care about this. As one Iranian official said in the course of the negotiations, \u201cIt\u2019s our moon shot,\u201d implying a dark paraphrase on Mort Sahl\u2019s Wernher von Braun satire: \u201cI aim at the stars, but sometimes I hit Israel.\u201d The Obama administration is now aiding in this moon shot, oblivious to the fact that this agreement as it currently stands is a wonderful pathway to nuclear escalation and conflict.\n\nFrom the beginning of these talks, it was apparent that the concessions would overwhelmingly come from one side of the table, and that the Iranian nuclear program was not going away. Now the very leverage that brought Iran to the negotiating table has been squandered, and is never returning. Though both the White House and Iranian talking points have emphasized that there will be penalties for any violation of the agreed terms, in reality no one believes they will be imposed.\n\nIn this case, I disagree with those Republicans who believe the next president will simply tear up the agreement. There is simply no going back. The coalition of states that imposed the nuclear sanctions upon Iran is exceedingly unlikely to be re-assembled. More important, a White House that has never acknowledged significant policy error simply won\u2019t admit a policy failure that a re-imposition of sanctions would imply. An administration that continues to tout Yemen, of all things, as a policy success is hardly about to engage in the high-profile, high-political-cost self-repudiation and second-guessing that so-called \u201csnapback\u201d sanctions would entail.\n\nAs for those making the case that this deal will work, this requires deliberate misreading of the natures of both the Iranian regime and the White House. Each must lie about the other, and themselves, to make the arrangement plausible. The Iranian leaders have to pretend they are peaceful and transparent, and not actually murderous fanatics who think the Holocaust was a good start. The American leaders have to pretend they are strong defenders of agreements who will go to war on principle, and not weak appeasers seeking any way out.\n\nMany on the right have drawn comparisons to the start of World War II, and this is understandable. But the better analogy here is not to the 1930s, but to 1973 and the Paris Peace Accords on the Vietnam War. In both cases we find the same sort of mutual nation-state dishonesty: The North Vietnamese had to pretend they were good-faith interlocutors who wanted peace, and not actually conquest-driven ideologues. The Americans had to pretend they were peace-with-honor seekers who would stand by their friends, and not cowardly sellouts who\u2019d abandon battlefield allies.\n\nIn both cases, 1973 and 2015, the outcome is the same: The bad guys get the Americans out of the way so they can complete their bloody work, which Americans know full well is happening, but is planning to cooperate nonetheless.\n\nA repeated problem with the Obama administration has been the lack of understanding that contracts only matter if they are enforceable\u2014and if there is a party willing to do the enforcement. The fatal flaw of the Iranian nuclear deal is that that this enforcing party, which can only be the United States of America, is effectively absent, with the U.N. Security Council empowered in a ridiculous repeat of the policy that worked so well in Iraq.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, this deal is premised on the idea of Russia\u2019s helpful enforcement while ignoring their practical incentives. Russia is currently the source for the enriched uranium supporting Iran\u2019s nuclear facility in Bushehr, because Tehran can\u2019t produce enough fuel to power the facility. The last thing we should be doing is trusting Russia to verify the peaceful nature of Iran\u2019s program. The likeliest path forward is that Iran will insist upon a full implementation of the deal, trading their tactical concessions for our strategic ones, until we have nothing left to concede. And then, because we will not demand meaningful reciprocity, they will consider it no more than a scrap of paper.\n\nThe president, in preempting his critics, has challenged them to come up with a better deal\u2014presenting a false dichotomy of this or nothing, and demanding that others imagine themselves doing what only he and his administration could. In that light, what would a better deal have looked like? We should take up President Obama\u2019s challenge of spring 2015 by referring to a man who sought a much better deal with Iran: President Obama of 2013. His comments to the Saban Forum referenced above represent the bare minimum of what we should have accepted. As we know, the president initially sought much more in leveraging the sanctions regime for a total shutdown of the Iranian nuclear program. The better deal that the president implies is unavailable now is in fact the better deal that he himself sought. The much better deal would have involved the cessation of Iranian nuke-building that he himself once believed possible.\n\nThe White House riposte would be: That deal is not actually available\u2014the Iranians wanted to keep their \u201cmoon shot.\u201d Then there is something not as good but still preferable: the status quo. The status quo\u2014which is not \u201cnothing\u201d but continued sanctions\u2014had many flaws. But it achieved one big thing that this deal does not: It caused grievous harm to the Iranian regime and its terror apparatus, and it was painful enough to bring them to the negotiating table with the Great Satan. It would have been painful enough to curb their means and methods for years to come.\n\nIran was in a hurry to see these sanctions cast away, understanding that they could be imposed nearly forever. Yet this is the great mystery of these negotiations, and nearly every other episode where this president collides with a ruthless foreign power: They behaved as if they could take the punishment\u2014and we behaved as if we could not wait to see it go.\n\nThat brings us to a more modern comparison: In spirit if not in aim, this deal very much resembles the resolution of the Syrian \u201cred line\u201d crisis of September 2013. There too, the president touted a peaceful resolution that supposedly achieved American aims with the support of the international community. Perceptive observers at the time understood that it was unlikely to last, both because it depended upon the goodwill and cooperation of bad actors, and also because it was widely understood that the American president was unlikely to enforce its terms.\n\nIt is better to set no red lines at all then to set them and back away. Back down once, and they have taken your measure. So it has proven once again. And so the Iranian nuclear-weapons program will endure long after Barack Obama has relinquished the presidency. It is no exaggeration to say that what the Obama administration has done here is set us on a fast track toward war based on the motivation of short-term domestic political gains.\n\nObama is preparing to sell this deal to the American people as \u201cit\u2019s this, or war\u201d. Perhaps he should embrace the healing power of \u201cand\u201d.\n\nBen Domenech is the publisher of The Federalist.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:27.784+0000"}

Hodges that same-sex marriage rights were universal, the popular verdict was in: gay marriage\u2014and gay life\u2014had become as American as apple pie.\n\nTwo years ago, in June 2013 the Supreme Court refused to limit the words \u201cmarriage\u201d and \u201cspouse\u201d to heterosexual unions, invalidating the Defense of Marriage Act. That November, the Senate passed ENDA, the Employment Nondiscrimination Act banning anti-gay discrimination in the workplace 64 to 32\u2014including 10 Republican votes, although the House of Representative has yet to pass it. Until recently, Democrats often opposed gay marriage publicly, even while approving it privately; now, Republicans are increasingly supporting gay marriage publicly\u2014or dodging the issue Chris Christie style\u2014even while disapproving it privately. This reversal in what constitutes the politically safe position on gays probably represents America\u2019s fastest, sharpest U-turn on a fundamental social issue since the 1960s.\n\nTwenty-two years ago, when the last Democratic president, Bill Clinton, admitted he approved of gays serving in the military, the resulting firestorm ultimately imposed \u201cDon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u201d Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, only 69 House members signed a letter supporting gay rights. Three years later in 1996, Clinton wooed the center by signing the Defense of Marriage Act, whose key provision many Clinton nominees to the Supreme Court eventually gutted in U.S. v. Windsor (2013) as placing an unfair \u201cstigma\u201d on gay spouses. As of January 2004 gay marriage was illegal in all 50 states.\n\nEven as recently as seven years ago, when Barack Obama\u2019s presidency began, gays were weaker politically. Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign triggered a surge of socially conservative black and Hispanic voters who helped pass California\u2019s Proposition 8 banning same sex marriage. With many blacks\u2014and Democrats\u2014still opposing civil unions, Obama had not endorsed gay marriage. As president, he only approved same sex marriage on May 9, 2012, thanks to Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s blurting out his own endorsement days earlier on \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nWhat John Adams would have labeled a revolution \u201cin the minds and hearts of the people,\u201d has been rapid and radical. Since Thomas Jefferson\u2019s wonderfully subversive phrase in the Declaration of Independence proclaiming \u201call men are created equal,\u201d gradually, \u201call\u201d broadened to include blacks, gays and others. \u201cMen\u201d expanded to include women; even the notion of \u201cequal\u201d grew.\n\nThose seeking to create a heroic history of gay liberation emphasize the Stonewall protests of 1969, along with four decades\u2019 worth of protests producing legislative and legal victories. But in fact, a mass cultural conversion precipitated this political change.\n\nGays changed their collective image by embracing marriage during an epidemic of heterosexual divorce.\n\nWhile rooted in the Sixties\u2019 sexual revolution and the Seventies\u2019 \u201cMe Decade,\u201d this cultural revolution went national in the 1980s. Ironically, the AIDS tragedy helped mainstream gay life. Many gays became more open about their lifestyles, while many heterosexuals became more aware of gays around them, especially after the disease killed President Ronald Reagan\u2019s friend, the Hollywood legend Rock Hudson, in 1985.\n\nIn the 1990s, despite the complex politics handcuffing Clinton, Hollywood propagandized effectively for gay equality. Movie blockbusters like Philadelphia starring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington, and The Birdcage, starring Robin Williams and Gene Hackman, cast in celluloid the dominant Hollywood stereotype of gays as normal, respectable, family-loving Americans underneath whatever flamboyant facades some might choose\u2014with conservative opponents cast as Neanderthals awaiting redemption. A year later, the comedienne Ellen DeGeneres came out of the closet on The Oprah Winfrey Show. With art first imitating, then shaping, life, DeGeneres\u2019s popular sitcom character \u201cEllen\u201d subsequently came out to her therapist, played by Oprah Winfrey.\n\nWill and Grace debuted in 1998 introducing Will Truman, an openly-gay lawyer sporting an all-American name and a conservative personality. By 2005, the American public proved surprisingly open to a sexually explicit macho males\u2019 love story in Brokeback Mountain. Movies and television had not only normalized what most once deemed abnormal, they glamorized what most once deemed repulsive.\n\nAs with the Reagan years, the George W. Bush years proved surprisingly good for gays in their march to social and political acceptance. Mary Cheney\u2019s lesbianism was not that scandalous, and actually softened the George W. Bush-Dick Cheney image. When Bush\u2019s former Republican National Committee chair, Ken Mehlman, came out in 2010, many emphasized the shocking fact that few were shocked.\n\nCheney\u2019s and Mehlman\u2019s outsider-as-insider stories, paralleling millions of others\u2019 paths, reveal gays\u2019 power as both an invisible minority and as the privileged oppressed. Like Jews, gays frequently pass easily in society, often asserting their distinct identity as they please. It becomes hard to hate \u201cthem\u201d when \u201cthey\u201d are \u201cus.\u201d\n\nAnd, like women, many gays sit at the most elite familial, corporate and governmental tables in the land, giving them the exclusive access long denied to African-Americans and other minorities. This growing intimacy, familiarity, and prominence, with millions coming out to relatives and colleagues, set the stage for this decade\u2019s political and legal changes. Before Friday, 37 states and Washington, D.C., allowed same-sex marriages.\n\nIronically\u2014but cleverly\u2014gays changed their collective image by embracing marriage during an epidemic of heterosexual divorce. Emphasizing their conventionality and familiarity, rather than flamboyance and rebelliousness, gays have framed equal treatment as a civil rights issue, appealing to an increasingly fluid and tolerant society that worships individual rights and abhors discrimination.\n\nThe late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan taught that: \u201cThe central conservative truth is that it is culture, not politics that determines the success of a society. The central liberal truth is that politics can change a culture and save it from itself.\u201d This time, cultural transformation triggered liberal change. Especially in today\u2019s horizontal democracy, culture matters, ideas count, media transforms\u2014and sometimes, politics and the law just catch up.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:28.301+0000"}

CGI is an asset, not an albatross.\n\nRepublicans and reporters look at CGI as a treasure trove of scandals, laden with foreign money from governments with questionable human rights practices and potential conflicts of interest.\n\nBut to Clinton, it\u2019s a living laboratory of programs that work alongside government, or instead of government, and in partnerships with corporations or foreign entities that may raise eyebrows among the pesky press but do good works.\n\nThe panel discussion at the Center for American Progress on Monday wasn\u2019t the first time she has talked up the family foundation since the news of the foreign donations broke a few weeks ago.\n\nClinton touted CGI in both her paid speech to the American Camp Association last week as well as at the United Nations before and after her dismal press conference about her State Department emails.\n\n\u201cHer long relationship with CGI is a matter of public record; she\u2019s not going to be able to run away from it, and if it\u2019s a good idea, I wouldn\u2019t advise her to stay silent about it,\u201d says Bill Galston, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser in the Clinton White House. \u201cIf she\u2019s going to get a lot of the downside of the relationship, why shouldn\u2019t she get the upside?\u201d\n\nNick Merrill, Clinton\u2019s spokesman, said that while he doesn\u2019t speak for the foundation, the press scrutiny \u201cdoesn\u2019t stop her from being proud of the very substantial work and innovative ideas that have come out of there.\u201d\n\nWhen Neera Tanden, president of Center for American Progress, and a former Clinton staffer, asked Clinton why the country should care about the success, or failure, of cities, Clinton referenced the CGI\u2019s work as \u201ca convener\u201d in addressing the issue of rampant inequality in cities where a highly educated and affluent population exists alongside people trapped in generational poverty.\n\nShe then described a CGI program called \u201cJob One,\u201d that works with companies to place people who\u2019ve never had jobs.\n\nHer comments were met with approving nods.\n\nClinton was very much in her element on the revitalization of cities panel.\n\nShe sat in the center of a roundish table that stretched out on both sides to accommodate other panelists, including HUD Secretary Julian Castro, who the audience was sizing up as a potential running mate should Clinton make it across the finish line on her second try.\n\n\u201cIf she\u2019s going to get a lot of the downside of the relationship, why shouldn\u2019t she get the upside?\u201d said Bill Galston, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution and a former policy adviser in the Clinton White House.\n\n\u201cWell, amen,\u201d Clinton said in her closing thoughts on the panel discussion. \u201cI love conversations like this. It\u2019s really nice to be getting back in on evidence-based solutions,\u201d a remark that brought knowing laughter from the invited audience.\n\n\u201cWe need to abolish the silos,\u201d she said, a reference to the repeated declaration by the participants that the various parts of government need to talk to each other, and finally, that what\u2019s needed is a culture of collaboration rather than a culture of confrontation.\n\nAnd then came the hint\u2014which has also become part of every Clinton speech lately.\n\n\u201cMayor,\u201d she said, turning to the mayor of Compton, California, 32-year-old Aja Brown, citing her work in disbanding gangs, \u201cDon\u2019t be surprised if you get a call, not too far from here, beautiful domed building\u2026\u201d where help is needed to bridge gaps, Clinton said amid the laughter at her teasing acknowledgment of what lies ahead should her campaign succeed.\n\nIn the audience were Victor and Sarah Kovner, longtime Democratic activists and fundraisers in New York.\n\nThey thought Clinton did well, that she was relaxed and appears ready for the rough road ahead. They acknowledged the recent Boston Globe editorial calling on Elizabeth Warren to enter the primaries, if only to ensure Clinton is in fighting form for the general election.\n\n\u201cSure, she could use a debate, but not one that\u2019s going to tear us apart,\u201d Sarah Kovner told The Daily Beast.\n\nAsked what she thought of Castro as a potential running mate, Kovner said no, too young and inexperienced. Democrats did that with the current president. Clinton could be seen nodding approvingly as Castro, the 40-year-old former mayor of San Antonio, declared, \u201cWe\u2019re falling in love with cities again,\u201d as he recounted programs he put in place for his city\u2019s poorest residents, including such simple things as improving bus routes.\n\nThat\u2019s all well and good, but Kovner\u2019s candidate is Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, former governor, old enough (57), experienced, no skeletons, no drama, and from a state Clinton would need to win.\n\nBut then that\u2019s getting way ahead of where we are in this process, so many more stories to write, and boxes to check before we know whether the rules are truly different this time, and which ones apply to the Clintons.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:28.568+0000"}
{"entityId": 1755, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Conspiracy-minded conservatives, be warned: The trove of Clinton emails doesn\u2019t prove much about her culpability for the infamous 9/11 anniversary attacks.\n\nIf Republicans were looking for a silver bullet to use against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, the State Department\u2019s Friday document dump about Benghazi wasn\u2019t it.\n\nThere\u2019s no illicit weapons Libyan program to be found in the emails, as some have speculated. No \u201cstand-down\u201d order. Just a hectic flow of information to and from Hillary Clinton\u2014about danger, about death, and ultimately, about condolences.\n\nThe State Department released Friday 296 emails involving Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State, from 2009 to 2013. The documents include some 300 emails related to Benghazi, which were turned over to the congressional committee investigating the 2012 attacks. The attacks left four Americans dead, including the U.S. ambassador to Libya.\n\nThe hundreds of emails released by the agency show a Secretary of State who was deeply engaged on Libyan issues\u2014but usually just in a crisis. While Clinton was a key proponent of intervening in Libya to protect civilians under threat from then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, her emails show that she took a largely hands-off approach toward the country.\n\nOf course, this document trove is an incomplete view, at best. It excludes any phone calls, briefings or memos. It doesn\u2019t include the emails that were deleted by Clinton\u2014and we know there were many. (Republicans noted \u201cinexplicable gaps\u201d in Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails over several time periods, such as from Oct. 2011 to Jan. 2012, and from April 2012 to July 2012. ) And it was released by a State Department that was formerly helmed by Clinton and is still part of a Democratic administration.\n\nBut according to her Benghazi-related email traffic, Clinton appears to be only been involved at times of crisis and even then deferred to those on the ground, including Stevens and friends outside government.\n\nClinton\u2019s emails show that the late Amb. Christopher Stevens had multiple brushes with danger in Benghazi in 2011\u2014more than a year before the September 2012 attacks that would ultimately take his life.\n\nThen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton received an update about Stevens\u2019 2011 security situation: that there had been intelligence indicating a credible threat to his safety, and that officials were moving swiftly out of the hotel he was staying at in Benghazi.\n\n\u201cThere is credible threat info against the hotel that our team is using\u2014and the rest of the Intl community is using, for that matter\u2026 DS [Diplomatic Security] going to evacuate our people to alt locations. Info suggested attack in next 24-48 hours,\u201d wrote top Clinton aide Jacob Sullivan in an email to Clinton on June 10, 2011, with the subject line, \u2018Hotel in Benghazi.\u2019\n\n\n\nAt the time Stevens was a special envoy to Libya, and the U.S. had joined a U.N. campaign to set up a no-fly zone to assist rebels in the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nIn a separate incident, in April 2011, a State Department official wrote:\n\n\u201cThe situation in Ajdabiyah has worsened to the point Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy\u2019s delegation is currently doing a phased checkout (paying the hotel bills, moving some comms to the boat, etc). He will monitor the situation to see if it deteriorates further, but no decision has been made on departure.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe communications received by the Secretary of State illustrate the fast pace of security decisions made on the ground\u2014but don\u2019t show Clinton with a direct role in these decisions. For example, there\u2019s no indication that Clinton intervened in the decision-making process when told about Stevens\u2019 2011 security scares.\n\nClinton was heavily criticized when it emerged in March that she had used a private email server to conduct business while she was Secretary of State. Her private email accounts prevented the normal process of archiving official government records. Clinton\u2019s staff had turned over some 55,000 pages of email correspondence to the State Department in December 2014.\n\nDemocrats on the Select Benghazi Committee had urged the release of Benghazi-related emails for months. Clinton herself had urged the State Department to swiftly publish the emails, telling reporters earlier this week that she wanted them in the public domain as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cI am pleased that the State Department released the complete set of Secretary Clinton\u2019s emails about Benghazi\u2014as Democrats requested months ago,\u201d said Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the committee.\n\nThe American people can now read all of these emails and see for themselves that they contain no evidence to back up claims that Secretary Clinton ordered a stand-down, approved an illicit weapons program, or any other wild allegation Republicans have made for years.\n\nIn the time between the June 2011 security scare and the September 2012 terrorist attacks, the mood in Libya ebbed and flowed\u2014Stevens left Libya in November 2011 before returning as U.S. ambassador in May 2012.\n\nIn July, Libya held national elections which went off well, leading to people heralding the country worldwide. Meanwhile, Islamist flags had emerged on buildings throughout Benghazi.\n\nThe correspondence in summer 2012 shows a somewhat positive situation in Libya: the last email from Stevens that Clinton receives paints a rosy picture: in July 2012 Sen. John McCain is in Tripoli, Libya, being lauded for his support of the rebels.\n\n\u201cThe atmosphere in Tripoli is very festive,\u201d Stevens wrote in one email on July 7, 2012. \u201cThe gov\u2019t declared today a holiday and people are driving around honking and waving flags and making peace sign gestures\u2026 McCain was applauded and thanked for his support wherever we went.\u201d\n\nThe world\u2019s focus doesn\u2019t dwell on Libya, and Clinton doesn\u2019t receive additional emails about Benghazi again until the 2012 attacks on U.S. facilities.\n\nBy September 2012, the situation in Libya had deteriorated. In a diary entry on Sept. 6, Stevens wrote about a \u201csecurity vacuum\u201d and \u201cdicey conditions,\u201d even suggesting that he was on an \u201cIslamist \u2018hit list\u2019 in Benghazi.\u201d\n\nOn the fateful day of Sept. 11, 2012, at approximately 4 p.m. in Washington, D.C., the first attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound occurred. Clinton had previously testified (PDF) that she was at the State Department that day, which could explain why she did not send or receive a large volume of emails about Benghazi.\n\nShe becomes more active on emails that evening, and at 11:37 p.m., she receives word through her Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills that the Libyan government had confirmed Amb. Steven\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cCheryl told me the Libyans confirmed his death. Should we announce tonight or wait until morning?\u201d Clinton wrote in an email to top aides.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe situation has worsened to the point Stevens is considering departure from Benghazi. The envoy's delegation is currently doing a phased checkout.\u201d\n\nThroughout the morning after the initial attacks she has a lot of activity: in particular she received a large number of messages expressing condolences to her and the State Department over the death of the ambassador.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Ambassador was a perfect role model of the kind of person we need representing us around the world, and the others had so much to give\u2014and already had given so much,\u201d said former Secretary of Defense Bob Gates.\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful, strong and moving statement by your boss. please tell her how much Sen. McCain appreciated it. Me too,\u201d wrote a top national security aide for Sen. John McCain.\n\nThat weekend, Clinton continued to exchange emails on the Benghazi issue. On Saturday Sept. 15, the day before Susan Rice appeared on cable shows to make the since-rescinded claim that the Benghazi attacks were the result of protests-turned-violent, Clinton was involved arranging calls from her home and the collection of an action memo via classified courier.\n\nThe emails give insight into how Clinton operated at the time: using classified couriers to move memos and getting on the phone with other world leaders, rather than using email.\n\nNone of the released emails show Clinton being involved with Rice\u2019s appearance on the Sunday shows, or the discussion of what Rice should say. She does, however, receive a transcript of what Rice would eventually say.\n\nFindings of the Republican-led Select committee on Benghazi may not be released until sometime in 2016, in the thick of campaign season.\n\nIf the Select Committee continues to operate through the end of the 2015, its estimated cost will rise to $6 million dollars. The House Select Committee on Benghazi was established in May 2014. If it continues through to the end of 2015, it will have been investigating for 19 months\u2014longer than other major, comparable investigations.\n\n(To compare, the joint inquiry into the intelligence community\u2019s actions with regard to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks took less than a year. The Senate Watergate committee operated for about 17 months before presenting its findings. And the Warren Commission on the assassination of President Kennedy operated for under a year.)\n\nThe release of Friday\u2019s Benghazi-related emails has itself been months in the waiting: the State Department had been going through an excruciating process of assessing the emails for any information that would show sensitive or personally identifiable information, and then removing it. The State Department will now turn its attention to performing the same task on thousands of Clinton emails that are not related to Benghazi.\n\nIn fact, Hillary Clinton\u2019s email correspondence has the potential to generate headlines at least through the end of the year, acting as a disruptive force that distracts from her presidential campaign.\n\nFor Republican committee chairman Trey Gowdy, the release of these emails are just the first step in a long slog to \u201ccollect and evaluate all of the relevant and material information necessary.\u201d Gowdy said that the emails released Friday had all been exclusively reviewed and released only after review by her own lawyers.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, a federal judge had dismissed a State Department plan to release her email archives, comprised of some 55,000 pages of emails, by January 2016. Instead, the judge asked the State Department to come up with a plan to gradually release the emails in stages.\n\nIn the nearer term, Hillary Clinton is expected to appear before the Select Committee on Benghazi, Gowdy said last week that he will not schedule the former Secretary of State\u2019s testimony until the State Department turns over more documents.\n\n\u201cThe Select Committee should schedule Secretary Clinton\u2019s public testimony now and stop wasting taxpayer money dragging out this political charade to harm Secretary Clinton\u2019s bid for president,\u201d Cummings, a Democrat, said Friday.\n\nThe New York Times obtained and published about a third of the Clinton Benghazi emails earlier this week, revealing that longtime Clinton friend Sidney Blumenthal had frequently written to her about Libya, serving as a source of information about the country before and after the 2012 attacks.\n\nWhile Blumenthal had originally blamed demonstrators in the American diplomatic facility in Benghazi, a subsequent memo fingered a Libyan terrorist group for the attacks, arguing that they had used the demonstrations as cover for the violence. This week, the Select Committee on Benghazi subpoenaed Blumenthal to appear before the panel.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:29.445+0000"}

And now his brother Jeb is trying to pin it on Obama as a way of going after Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe schedule was already set in place when Obama took office in 2009. That included the 2009 closing of our biggest POW facility, Camp Bucca. The prisoners who were released from Bucca included Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nAs has been reported in The Daily Beast, al-Baghdadi uttered some parting words to the camp\u2019s commander.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll see you guys in New York,\u2019\u201d Army Colonel Kenneth King recalls.\n\nAl-Baghdadi went on to become the head of ISIS and to announce the creation of a new Islamic State.\n\nObama did try to renegotiate the so-called \u201cSOFA agreement\u201d in order to allow U.S. troops to remain in Iraq past 2011, but he could not get the deal he wanted. Critics say he could have taken a more aggressive stance in the years after 2011, when the descendants of al Qaeda in Iraq began a murderous comeback.\n\n\n\nBut, of course, al Qaeda in Iraq would not have been a force of any consequence if President Bush had not smashed the Iraqi state in 2003.\n\nIn the meantime, we spent billions training Iraqi government troops who fled seemingly whenever they were attacked, leaving behind billions more in U.S. supplied equipment.\n\nNone of that was Obama\u2019s creation.\n\nAll of it was a consequence of what President Bush so rashly set in motion.\n\n\n\nAnd now his brother Jeb is trying to pin it on Obama as a way of going after Hillary Clinton. Talk about nutty. Not to mention offensive.\n\nTrump is supposed to be the nutty and offensive one, but when it comes to ISIS he seems mainly to be woefully uninformed.\n\n\u201cBelieve it or not, Iran is funneling money to ISIS,\u201d Trump said on CNN.\n\nJeb could no doubt tell you that Iran is in fact battling ISIS by proxy and, in some instances, directly.\n\nSomething other than ignorance is at work when Jeb tries to pin the ISIS mess on Obama and Hillary.\n\nYes, as senator, Hillary did vote in favor of invading Iraq. And yes, as Secretary of State, she failed to make Iraq a top priority. (Though she did push Obama to keep American troops in Iraq after 2011.)\n\n\n\nBut she can hardly be faulted for what was all but sure to follow when Jeb\u2019s brother gave the orders to invade Iraq.\n\nAnd Obama is even less at fault.\n\nJeb is only able to claim otherwise because the people who truly are to blame have never been held accountable.\n\nThat includes not just Jeb\u2019s brother but also former Vice President Dick Cheney, who promises to be even nuttier than Jeb when he makes an appearance of his own at the Reagan Library on September 9, two days before the 14th anniversary of 9/11.\n\nCheney and his daughter, Liz, will be there to sign copies of their new book, Exceptional: Why the World Needs a Powerful America. The library\u2019s website says, \u201cDick and Liz Cheney explain the unique and indispensable nature of American power, reveal the damage done by President Obama\u2019s abandonment of this principle, and show how America can and must lead again.\u201d\n\nNever mind that between the war in Iraq, the loss of focus on Afghanistan and the CIA torture scandal, the elder Cheney probably did more to weaken America than any other single individual in recent history.\n\nThe website goes on, \u201cThe Cheneys do what no one before them has done: chart a path forward to restoring American power and strength, explaining what must be done to reverse course, to fight and win the war on terror, to rebuild our military and reassure our allies that they can once again rely on American leadership.\u201d\n\nNeither parody nor irony seem intended as the website concludes, \u201cA critical, frank, and much-needed touchstone, Exceptional should stand as a guiding principle for the potential presidential candidates in 2016\u2014and for policymakers today and beyond.\u201d\n\nTalk about beyond nuts.\n\nPerhaps if some of the other candidates do use Cheney\u2019s book as a guiding principle, they too can prove to be even nuttier than Trump, who seems unlikely to read a book or anything else.\n\nAll anybody who wants to sound wackier than The Donald need do is begin a sentence with, \u201cWell, Dick Cheney says\u2026\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Trump remains not just the most vulgar of the candidates, but also the front-runner.\n\n", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:29.653+0000"}

But not because they like the law.\n\nToday, the Supreme Court voted not to kill Obamacare because of a typo.\n\nMore precisely, it ruled, 6-3, that the Affordable Care Act wasn\u2019t meant to kill itself: that a seemingly innocuous phrase (\u201cestablished by the state\u201d) should not lead to the implosion of the entire health care system, and thus should be read in context, rather than purely literalistically.\n\nThus, while media coverage is already calling this a \u201cvictory for the Obama administration,\u201d it really is a victory for sensible statutory construction. Which is why the case was 6-3, and the opinion was written by Chief Justice Roberts.\n\nMoreover, while conservative and liberal court-watchers are both remarking about the Roberts Court\u2019s \u201cliberalism\u201d that read is, at best, incomplete.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s remember that in other courts, this case might never have even made it to the Supreme Court in the first place. It began as an enterprising attempt by an obscure conservative policy wonk to poke holes in Obamacare, and the phrase at issue was recently revealed to be a drafting error, cut and pasted from an earlier version.\n\nSo, while some may see the Chief Justice\u2019s legacy as twice saving Obamacare, one could just as easily see it as twice saving the Supreme Court.\n\nSecond, and more interestingly, the King v. Burwell opinion is what real judicial conservatism\u2014as opposed to ideological, political conservatism\u2014looks like.\n\nThis case was not, let\u2019s remember, a referendum on Obamacare\u2019s merits. It was about a quirk in the literal text of the law. Could people receive tax subsidies if they bought their insurance only on a state-run exchange, or could they qualify if they bought their insurance on a federal exchange, as well?\n\nThe former reading hews literally to that phrase: \u201cestablished by the state.\u201d But it does so at the expense of the entire statute, since not extending the subsidies would most likely cause the whole system to enter a \u201cdeath spiral.\u201d\n\nLong-established conservative canons of judicial interpretation hold that courts should read laws as if they\u2019re meant to work\u2014not in ways that would render them useless. Moreover, as the Chief Justice painstakingly described, there are other provisions in the ACA that only make sense if all \u201cqualified individuals\u201d are included, not just those in state exchanges.\n\nAnd as for those four words? \u201cThe meaning of that phrase may not be as clear as it appears when read out of context,\u201d the Chief Justice wrote.\n\nSo, on one hand, it\u2019s a literalistic reading of one phrase. On the other, it\u2019s resolving internal contradictions and enabling the law to function. It is not a judicial innovation to choose the latter.\n\nIndeed, it is common sense\u2014and conservative legal theory.\n\nThis decision is only \u201cliberal\u201d in the best way: It is part of the functioning of a small-\u201cl\u201d liberal democracy, subordinating one\u2019s personal political opinions to an institution\u2019s role in civil society.\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the last several paragraphs have said nothing about whether it\u2019s a good idea for the government to manipulate the health care system. That\u2019s a political question, not a judicial one. (Whether it is constitutional was resolved in the earlier Obamacare case, NFIB v. Sebelius.) The judicial question is how statutes are to be interpreted.\n\nIn today\u2019s polarized political environment, liberals and conservatives alike miss this point completely. The Court is seen as voting on Obamacare, voting on gay marriage, or\u2014in today\u2019s other major case\u2014voting on civil rights laws. Indeed, particularly when it comes to marriage, courts get criticized for \u201coverruling the will of the people.\u201d\n\nThat is completely wrongheaded, and indeed, anti-democratic. Of course courts overrule the will of the people when that will is unconstitutional. That\u2019s the whole point of judicial review. And of course courts are not casting votes on the merits of the laws they review.\n\n(That being said, Chief Justice Roberts did spend the first part of his opinion cataloguing the state precedents to the Affordable Care Act, as if to remind political conservatives that it was originally a Republican idea. Not casting a vote is not the same as being politically oblivious.)\n\nNotably, Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent\u2014while typically angry, invective, and coarse, at one point calling the ACA \u201cSCOTUScare\u201d\u2014did not make some political argument for why Obamacare is a bad idea. He found fault with the majority\u2019s theory of judicial interpretation, arguing that courts must not \u201crepair\u201d bad laws, but simply review them as written. That seems odd and myopic in this case\u2014but it\u2019s still judicial reasoning.\n\nCertainly, one might question Justice Scalia\u2019s motives; he is literalistic when it suits him, expansive when it doesn\u2019t. Just look at Hobby Lobby for a case that massively extended the plain meaning of the statute, defining corporations as people. However, even if justices are politically motivated, they are at the very least bound to do the work of judicial interpretation\u2014as Justice Scalia did here.\n\nNot so on Fox News\u2014or, to a lesser extent, on MSNBC. In conservative and liberal pundit-land, these decisions are mere referenda of nine people in robes. In the legal academy, this cynical view is known as \u201cpositivism\u201d\u2014the idea that, underneath all the rationalization, courts are just judges exercising power. It is a marginal view, as it deserves to be.\n\nNo. Just as, a few months ago, the Supreme Court expanded the social safety net for pregnant women for conservative judicial reasons, it has now left the ACA standing for the same reasons.\n\nThis decision is only \u201cliberal\u201d in the best way: It is part of the functioning of a small-\u201cl\u201d liberal democracy, subordinating one\u2019s personal political opinions to an institution\u2019s role in civil society. For that reason, it is conservative in the best way, as well.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:29.841+0000"}

But if both camps support the same law for the same reasons, what\u2019s the real difference?\n\nThe fight over Indiana\u2019s Religious Freedom Restoration Act has pulled back the curtain on the Polite Right.\n\nBeltway-centric but not moderate, these cautious spokesmen for civility do not practice your drunk uncle\u2019s bigotry. They endorse a more soft-spoken and socially acceptable kind of prejudice. This prejudice comes clothed in talk of tolerance and piety, appeals to fairness and freedom.\n\nThey talk about faith and religious rights but what defenders of the pre-\u201cfix\u201d RFRA really wanted was the privilege of condoning bigotry without actually being associated with it. It\u2019s more than a rhetorical sleight of hand to turn denial of service into an \u201cinfringement upon religious practice.\u201d It\u2019s Solomon sawing Lady Justice in half. Such an argument insists that theologically-condoned discrimination is somehow less hurtful than the normal, not-God-approved form. \u201cYou can still get married!\u201d and \u201cYou can continue to deny service to those you see as morally unfit!\u201d do not cancel each other out.\n\nIndeed, many of those who supported Indiana\u2019s original law recognized this\u2014that denying service to gay couples is an impediment to their gaining full civil rights. The American Family Association\u2019s Bryan Fischer, for one. Fischer is a nationally-syndicated radio host, not simply a lone fruitcake, even though the next exit down from his particular brand of crazy is the Westboro Baptist Church: His Twitter feed is full of references to \u201cthe Church of the Rainbow Jihad,\u201d \u201csame-sex cakes,\u201d the \u201cGay Gestapo,\u201d and several warnings that \u201cBig Gay is not about \u2018marriage equality\u2019 but \u2018homosexual supremacy.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s easy to mock the idea of \u201cBig Gay\u201d (what a size queen!), but Fischer\u2019s logic is the perfect mirror to the argument of the law\u2019s critics. All you have to do is scale down the hyperbole, and read \u201cfull civil rights\u201d where Fischer fears \u201cgay rule.\u201d Indiana\u2019s RFRA was intended to hamper the progress of \u201cBig Gay and the Homosexual Supremacy\u201d (my favorite Motown band). If the original RFRA had been implemented, the civil rights for LGTB individuals would have been diminished. Fischer approvingly tweeted out Mother Jones\u2019 mocking of his supposed paranoia\u2014that\u2019s how closely the analysis of the law\u2019s most ardent defenders tracks that of its most ardent detractors.\n\nThe Polite Right wants nothing to do with Fischer. When I drew attention to his Twitter timeline, the proudly reasonable conservatives that populate the Acela Corridor were offended. They demanded that I acknowledge that Fischer is not representative of all conservatives, or even all defenders of the law\u2014and that\u2019s true, in the sense that Polite Right would never sully themselves with such obvious homophobia.\n\nBryan Fischer is a hateful, ignorant homophobe. The people I know on the Polite Right are not hateful, and certainly not ignorant. Some of them are gay themselves.\n\nWhile it\u2019s Bryan Fischer\u2019s rhetoric that makes him so amusingly offensive, it\u2019s his logic and his goals that demand an answer from those who are aligned with him.\n\nBut while it\u2019s Bryan Fischer\u2019s rhetoric that makes him so amusingly offensive, it\u2019s his logic and his goals that demand an answer from those who are aligned with him as far as the RFRA goes. In other words: I believe my friends on the Polite Right when they say they don\u2019t hate gay people; but when it comes to the RFRA, I am not convinced that emotional or theological context is less important than acts of discrimination itself.\n\nPut another way: Two different Christian bakery owners both refuse to bake a cake for two different gay weddings. One bakery owner says that\u2019s because he believes gay people are sinful sodomites that regularly recruit and molest children. The other says she loves and respects gay people but \u201cjust can\u2019t participate in a ceremony that goes against my faith.\u201d The Indiana RFRA was written to protect both bakers, not just the nice one.\n\nOf course, both sides of the debate have their drunk uncles. On the left, it was a bunch of randy Yelpers and rageful Twitterers that embarrassed the more selectively outraged RFRA critics. The Memories Pizza owners turned out to be the nice, presentable sort of discriminators, and some of their online critics went overboard in expressing their upset.\n\nIt\u2019s not fair to equate the marauding Internet hoards with Fischer, though. If the idiots that suggested burning down Memories Pizza were seeking legal protection for theologically-sanctioned arson, the parallel might hold. But they are not an organized pro-arson lobbying block, they\u2019re idiots. And I hope those that went over the legal line have to suffer consequences for their indulgence.\n\nI\u2019m proud to live in a society where being accused of bigotry is itself offensive. I like it that decent people don\u2019t want to be associated with obvious homophobes. But the polite solution to an association with an obvious homophobe isn\u2019t to simply deny the relationship\u2014it\u2019s to ask yourself what you have in common.\n\nThe problem is that Bryan Fischer and the Polite Right want the same thing, for the same reasons, even if they use very different language to make their case. They\u2019re activist allies, joined at the hip whether they like it or not. You might even say they\u2019re married.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:29.980+0000"}
{"entityId": 1759, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In Kentucky and now Illinois, pro-right-to-work forces are skipping statewide pushes to gut organized labor in favor of local battles that they hope will upend the entire state.\n\nCHICAGO \u2014 If there was an item in the Painters District Council 30 monthly newsletter regarding \u201cright to work\u201d in Illinois, Dave Schmidgall must have missed it. The longtime union painter, living in Peoria and approaching 50, has a mindset that many of his union brothers and sisters his age have:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll never happen,\u201d he said.\n\nUnless a union-busting lawyer from Florida and Republican Governor Bruce Rauner get their way, that is. Unable to pass a bill statewide with a Democratic supermajority in the legislature, Rauner and others are pushing for counties to enact their own \u201cempowerment zones,\u201d where right-to-work would become law. In Brent Yessin, the lawyer who runs a nonprofit called Protect My Check, unions have a powerful foe.\n\nUnion advocates argue that collecting dues from members who don\u2019t wish to be represented by the union is essential to keeping the organizations alive. In right-to-work states\u2014and in the \u201cempowerment zones\u201d Rauner and others like Yessin are pushing for\u2014unions wouldn\u2019t be allowed to collect these \u201cfair share dues\u201d from members who opt out of union membership. (As union membership declines, poverty increases.)\n\nWhile many in Illinois, like Schmidgall, consider right to work impossible, they might want to start paying attention before counties begin turning anti-union one by one like they have in neighboring Kentucky. In the last six months in there, Yessin has been instrumental in implementing right to work in 12 of Kentucky\u2019s 120 counties. While he wouldn\u2019t say who exactly he\u2019s working with, Yessin made clear his organization is taking the fight to Illinois.\n\nYessin and Rauner contend that the Illinois constitution grants \u201chome rule\u201d powers to any municipality with more than 25,000 residents, giving cities and counties the right to decide for themselves if they want to become right to work.\n\n\u201cThe goal would be to pass enough of them that you have an influence on state policy,\u201d Yessin told The Daily Beast of local right-to-work ordinances. In Kentucky, Yessin and his allies believe they are reaching a \u201ctipping point,\u201d where lawmakers will pass right to work at the state level simply because so many counties have already done it.\n\n\u201cI think downstate Illinois gets a lot more interested as we push into Kentucky and Missouri.\u201d\n\nHe may be correct. In June, Effingham, just a two-hour drive from the Kentucky border, broached the subject. The city council introduced a resolution to support Rauner\u2019s agenda, which calls for cities and counties to decide for themselves whether to enact right to work. Dexter Sloan, a union worker, spoke against the resolution at a city council meeting.\n\n\u201cAlmost five years ago, my firstborn son had a brain aneurysm and died in my arms\u2014because I didn\u2019t have insurance,\u201d Sloan said, according to the local paper. \u201cThat\u2019s when I left and went union.\u201d\n\nWhile union members like Sloan have been vocal in their opposition to right to work, those who support it are less likely to speak up. Cue Yessin and Protect My Check.\n\n\u201cUnion people think it\u2019s a bunch of millionaires sitting around in a room and deciding to push this,\u201d he said. \u201cContrary to the union\u2019s opinions on this, if there\u2019s not a grassroots support, we\u2019re not going to shove it down their throat.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlmost five years ago, my firstborn son had a brain aneurysm and died in my arms\u2014because I didn\u2019t have insurance. That\u2019s when I left and went union.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s virtually impossible to tell how true Yessin\u2019s claim is. Protect My Check is a nonprofit that isn\u2019t required to disclose its donors. Like many political action committees, Protect My Check is designated as a 501(c)(4) tax-exempt organization by the IRS. Such organizations are technically designed to promote social welfare, like charities and local church groups, but often serve partisan ends. Yessin said the group accepts donations from local business people who support right to work, but it also receives big donations and grants from larger groups, although he wouldn\u2019t say whom.\n\nThrough Protect My Check, Yessin helps to craft right-to-work ordinances and, in some cases, defend them when they come under attack in court. This is currently the case in Kentucky, where some of the 12 right-to-work counties are now in a legal fight with unions who contend the ordinances violate state and federal labor laws.\n\nYessin has been involved in similar battles for decades, and his connections in the business community combined with his legal expertise make him a formidable ally for small-town legislators looking to enact right to work. Yessin and his group give local governments the legal and financial muscle to defend their actions, muscle that is often only available to the unions they\u2019re fighting against.\n\nRauner\u2019s staff didn\u2019t respond to multiple requests for comment, and the governor\u2019s administration denied a Freedom of Information Act request that called for the release of emails related to right to work.\n\n\u201cI never comment on communications with elected officials unless it helps them,\u201d Yessin said when asked whether he\u2019s been in talks with the Rauner administration.\n\nDemocratic Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said that the National Labor Relations Act does not allow local units of government like cities and counties to enact right to work. The Rauner administration told the Chicago Tribune that it \u201crespectfully disagrees\u201d with Madigan.\n\nSchmidgall hadn\u2019t heard of Yessin, and while he certainly has his gripes with the union and the dues he has to pay, he said right to work simply isn\u2019t feasible for him. He\u2019s almost done paying off his house. A new-but-used Harley Davidson sits in his garage next to a truck with just a few payments left on it. His pool is clean, full and ready for summer; his fridge is stocked with beer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never going to happen here, dude,\u201d Schmidgall said. \u201cBesides, I only have eight years until retirement. There\u2019s no way in hell it\u2019ll happen before then.\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:30.116+0000"}

He also makes the case for letting more immigrants come into the country legally.\n\n\u201cLeft to its own devices and without increased immigration, America\u2019s population is shrinking and aging,\u201d Bush and Bolick write. \u201cWe need more immigrants to stem that debilitating demographic tide. We believe there will be less opposition to increased immigration if Americans perceive the need for and the value of immigration\u2014which will happen if we fix our system so that most who enter our country add tangible value.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy idea is to narrow the number of people coming for family petitioning and expanding the number of economic immigrants,\u201d Jeb Bush said. \u201cYou\u2019re not increasing the number overall.\u201d\n\nIn other words, Bush argues that we need more legal immigrants to preserve the entitlement system. But that\u2019s a general statement, not a specific policy prescription.\n\nEnter, Bush\u2019s second approach: wonk mode.\n\nWonk mode is very different.\n\nSometimes, instead of making general statements (like, \u201cin the future, if we are to have any labor force growth at all, immigrants will have to supply it,\u201d as he writes in his book), he discusses his specific immigration policy proposal.\n\nAt the National Review Institute Ideas Summit last month, NR editor Rich Lowry pressed Bush on whether or not he wanted to let more immigrants come into the U.S. legally.\n\n\u201cI think the argument that [Wisconsin Gov. Scott] Walker would make, or at least that Sen. Jeff Sessions would make, is\u2014it\u2019s not an argument that it\u2019s necessarily a zero-sum game,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic economic argument having to do with supply and demand. And if you increase the supply of low-skilled labor, of course low skilled wages are going to go down.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo who\u2019s suggesting that?\u201d asked Bush. \u201cThat\u2019s the whole\u2014that\u2019s the false argument.\u201d\n\nThen Lowry pointed out that the Senate Gang of 8 immigration bill would have increased legal immigration levels.\n\n\u201cAlthough they talked the game of high skills, this will always increase low skills,\u201d Lowry said. \u201cBut you want to decrease low skills?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a United States Senator, thank God, just for the record here,\u201d replied Bush, to laughs. \u201cI live in Miami, I\u2019m outside of Washington. I\u2019ve written a book about this. What I was describing is my ideas. My idea is to narrow the number of people coming for family petitioning and expanding the number of economic immigrants. You\u2019re not increasing the number overall.\u201d\n\nThat last sentence is the most important part.\n\nEven though Bush writes in his book that he thinks we need more immigrants to grow labor participation rates and protect the entitlement system, his specific comprehensive immigration reform plan doesn\u2019t intentionally increase the number of immigrants legally entering the U.S. every year.\n\nRather, it would decrease the number of immigrants allowed to enter because they\u2019re related to a legal U.S. resident\u2014for instance, it would keep the parents and adult siblings of legal U.S. residents from entering just because of that relationship\u2014and give their spots to would-be immigrants with jobs lined up.\n\nSo as a general principle, Bush seems to back higher legal immigration levels. But the specific immigration policy overhaul that his book proposes doesn\u2019t do that.\n\nHis final way of addressing the issue could be called \u201cmaybe mode.\u201d\n\nBush talks about immigration policy changes that he could be open to but doesn\u2019t actively advocate.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what happened on The Kelly File Monday night.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bush has often touted the fact that he supports a pathway to legal status for the undocumented immigrants but doesn\u2019t favor giving them citizenship.\n\nHe told Charlie Rose in 2012, however, that he would be open to letting those immigrants become citizens. Kelly pressed him on this, and he said that while his plan doesn\u2019t call for a pathway to citizenship, he would be open to it if it was part of a deal that got him his other immigration priorities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve said, as long as there\u2014if that was the way to get to a deal, where we turned immigration into a catalyst for high, sustained economic growth, where we did all the things we needed to do in border security, where we narrowed the number of people coming through family petition and dramatically expanded a like kind number for economic purposes which will help us grow and help the median rise up, in return for that, as a compromise, sure.\u201d\n\nThen he continued with this: \u201cBut the plan in our book, the plan that I have suggested when I go out and speak, which is almost every day on the subject, I\u2019m talking about a path to legalized status.\u201d\n\nSo if Bush became president, a pathway to citizenship would be an option on the negotiating table.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that many Democrats in Congress insist on a pathway to citizenship as a prerequisite for their support of any comprehensive immigration reform bill.\n\nJeb\u2019s nuanced way of speaking about immigration reform sets him apart from his competition. Most (if not all) of the other Republican presidential contenders just talk about immigration in one way: opposition.\n\nThey oppose the president\u2019s executive actions on immigration, so-called amnesty and any pathway to citizenship.\n\nBut they\u2019re far less specific when it comes to how many legal immigrants they would allow into the country every year, how their ideal immigration policy would work, and what kind of compromises they\u2019d be willing to make to get there.\n\nImmigration could be the single most contentious issue for Republican primary contenders. And for many primary voters, it\u2019s one of the most important. By talking about the issue in a variety of different ways, Bush has already distinguished himself from his potential competitors. It\u2019s an open question as to whether primary voters and caucus-goers will think that\u2019s a good thing.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:30.471+0000"}

The news is not good.\n\nThe report arrived two or three weeks ago, gift-wrapped as a present for the high-riding Republican front-runner Donald Trump, a scorched-earth attack on Trump\u2019s old nemesis, the news. As regular devotees of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show understand, Mr. O\u2019s gifts tend to arrive with a self-interest clause, a \u201csomething-we-can-both-use\u201d aroma about them, which is something like presenting the lady of the house with a French maid costume for your anniversary, or Ralph Kramden giving Alice a bowling ball for Valentine\u2019s. If you do not know who Bill O\u2019Reilly and Ralph Kramden are, by the way, do yourself a favor and find out who Ralph Kramden is very soon.\n\nBut I have strayed. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s assessment is that the American press \u201cdespises\u201d The Donald for the following reasons:\n\nBecause he has no fear.\n\nBecause he could not care less about censoring himself.\n\nBecause the press does not intimidate him, and because of that approach the media believe they must punish Mr. Trump for being disrespectful and not cowering before them, plus they don\u2019t like his politics, generally speaking.\n\nAll of that in quotation marks. O\u2019Reilly, word for word.\n\nAnd that being the case, those of us in the flock already know that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s defense of Donald Trump is not really about Donald Trump (yes, I realize that this thing I have about watching O\u2019Reilly is getting out of hand.

Mr. O vowed never to talk about it again, and didn\u2019t want anybody else to talk about it either.\n\nBut talk they did\u2014particularly the tabloids\u2014admittedly without much sympathy, and O\u2019Reilly has been angling to protect public figures from the First Amendment ever since.\n\nWhere else am I supposed to go to watch something like that?\n\nBut I continue to stray. Mr. O has not finished assailing the press. The press, he says, \u201cis a very powerful force in America\u201d\u2014huh?\u2014and \u201cif (the press) deems someone unworthy, they will try to destroy that person\u2026\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, the American media\u2014although there are exceptions\u2014are not looking out for you. They have an agenda, these people, and they often use that agenda in corrupt ways.\u201d\n\n***\n\n\n\nOuch.\n\nThis looks to me like a misunderstanding, which means that I\u2019m not sure putting a clown\u2019s nose on Donald Trump\u2019s picture and running it on the front page signals the kind of all-in, Old Testament hate that O\u2019Reilly thinks it does.\n\nThe relevant case, as I think they say in court, goes back not quite to the Old Testament, but close. Nineteen forty-seven. The war is over, television has begun its invasion and professional wrestling has caught America\u2019s eye. The country is taking a break, a little quiet time between wars. It is still two years before the world will first hear Bill O\u2019Reilly scream. America needs a new rallying point, something to unite against until the next war, and up steps a 22-year-old eighth-grade dropout named George Raymond Wagner.\n\nGorgeous George.\n\nGorgeous is not much to look at\u2014five-eight or so, 210 pounds, pale-skinned and dimpled with fat, nothing to brag about even in wrestlers of television\u2019s first, pre-steroids, era. Yet George has something that Haystacks Calhoun and the others don\u2019t. He has an idea. And hair. Long, blond, 100-strokes-a-night tresses, which he primps at like a movie star in and out of the ring, often over the bodies of his victims.\n\nAnd cheat? He gouges you in the eyes, kicks you in the spine (strangely enough, nobody ever got kicked in the lap in those days), rakes your ears, your nose, your eyebrows, pulls down your wrestling tights when the referee isn\u2019t looking, and sometimes yes, pulls hair. Strangely, nobody ever seems to pull his back. But that\u2019s not all. Most of the brutalized are clean-cut, follow-the-rules American boys, some just home from the war. Does Gorgeous care?\n\nHe cuts off the referee\u2019s view and uses a string hidden in his trunks for strangling, then judo-chops you in the Adam\u2019s apple. He gives you the business with his middle knuckle, he bites and pinches. He mauls you and then runs out of the ring like a coward when you get mad, and two minutes later, he is flying off the top rope at the corner ring post and mashing your kidneys with the heels of his wrestling boots.\n\nAnd afterwards, he primps. An assistant brings him a mirror, and if the referee and the wrestling officials turn their backs, he sneaks around behind them and kicks you in the head again, just to be kicking somebody in the head, and even as America screams for his blood, Gorgeous is taking in the money. He relieves the announcer of his microphone and brags to the mob that he is not only the greatest wrestler in the world but also the most beautiful, desirable man in America.\n\nBy now, at the height of his detestation (popularity\u2014what\u2019s the difference?) Gorgeous is demanding\u2014and getting\u201450 present of the gate everywhere he wrestles. He marries a girl named Betty Hanson in the wrestling ring and draws the largest audience that has ever watched anything on television, and when it works he does it again and again, in rings all across the country.\n\n***\n\nStill, like anything else, it ends. The glory years are over. George retires in 1962, losing his last match to The (masked) Destroyer, and, following to the special rules of the contest, trims his flowing, blond fleece to the scalp. In one year out of the spotlight, Gorgeous George drinks himself to death. Forty-eight years old, it makes you sad, thinking of how much fun he left behind.\n\nThe life however is not wasted. George spawns thousands of braggarts. Generations of them ride the nation\u2019s derision, some to wealth and fame. Empty r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, invented pasts, half-truths. One of them, a young light-heavyweight boxer named Cassius Clay, confuses the genre by making good on every promise, not only in the ring but out, beginning when thousands of Americans shell out exorbitant pay-for-view prices all over the country to watch his public execution by Sonny Liston\u2014the scariest black man in the world, an 8-to-1 favorite. And now who to root for? The kid with the mouth makes it confusing to be a racist.\n\nHe beats Sonny Liston of course, twice. Clay becomes Ali, who becomes a serious man, and I think probably a great man, and his reach goes farther than even he intended. A long way beyond boxing. And the truth is, that ruins the fun. At least for those of us who have to turn away toward the end out of fear that he will be hurt.\n\nLuckily, there is only one Ali, and only one Gorgeous George. Hundreds of pale imitations, some of them old men still out there slinging hash, bragging, pretending to be what they\u2019re not. Some of them forgetting that they are pretenders. The beauty of it, you don\u2019t ever worry about any of them getting hurt, because there\u2019s nothing there but vanity. Nothing to keep you from enjoying the show.\n\nWhat is more fun for the audience than of them getting huffy and accusing the press of \u201ccorruption\u201d for putting a clown\u2019s nose on a clown?\n\nBooing has always been half the fun.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:30.967+0000"}
{"entityId": 1762, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "If the presidential election was held on Twitter, The Donald would probably win.\n\nThe world of Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter account is a stark one.\n\n\n\nThings that Trump likes\u2014himself, people who agree with him, and his Turnberry Resort in Scotland\u2014are \u201cgreat,\u201d a word Trump has tweeted a whopping 152 times since announcing his candidacy, according to a report from the social media analytics company Talkwalker. Things that Trump doesn\u2019t like\u2014such as Macy\u2019s, Arianna Huffington, and The Daily Beast\u2014are either losing money or they\u2019re a \u201cdummy,\u201d another favorite Trump-ism. Much like his campaign, Trump\u2019s Twitter feed is a parade of self-aggrandizement, swipes at reporters, and childish barbs.\n\nBut if the presidential election was a Twitter popularity contest\u2014and thank God it\u2019s not\u2014one thing is clear: Trump would win by a landslide. The Donald would probably take this as a compliment but there\u2019s no one better at Twitter than he is. The relationship between Trump and Twitter is the perfect marriage of man and medium: his terse insults are perfectly suited to the 140-character form and his controversy-a-day campaign feeds off of Twitter\u2019s short attention span. Marshall McLuhan\u2019s reminder that \u201cthe medium is the message\u201d has never been more relevant, or more embarrassing.\n\nJust how well is Trump doing on Twitter?\n\nAccording to PolitiTrends data, Trump has been the most tweeted-about candidate by a wide margin for the last month, frequently becoming the subject of 70,000 tweets per day while his competitors flounder in the 20,000 range. He has 3.43 million Twitter followers, surpassed by Hillary Clinton\u2019s 3.97 million, but according to an analysis by Vocativ he has a much higher percentage of authentic, non-robot Twitter followers (90 percent) than the Democratic front-runner (65 percent). The Talkwalker report provided to The Daily Beast also shows that he has been retweeted 1.86 million times since he first stepped off of that escalator on June 16.\n\nTrump has been the most tweeted-about candidate by a wide margin for the last month, frequently becoming the subject of 70,000 tweets per day while his competitors flounder in the 20,000 range.\n\nHis net worth might be less than he claims but on Twitter, Trump is exactly as large as he appears.\n\nThe size of Trump\u2019s Twitter empire can almost certainly be attributed to his Apprentice-driven celebrity status prior to his campaign. Back in May, he was already approaching 3 million followers. After all, Twitter is where people come to gawk at their favorite reality stars\u2014the more unhinged and unfiltered the better\u2014and The Donald is no exception. More so than any other social media network, Twitter is a spectator sport, an arena where blows are exchanged before our eyes. And Trump never fails to supply the drama.\n\nFor example, after saying that John McCain was \u201cnot a war hero\u201d in mid-July\u2014a gaffe that some thought might end his campaign\u2014Trump took to Twitter, not to apologize, but to double down on his attack.\n\nWhen he took exception to The Daily Beast\u2019s reporting on an alleged incident between himself and his ex-wife Ivana described in Harry Hurt III\u2019s 1993 book Lost Tycoon as \u201crape,\u201d Trump went after Hurt on Twitter, publicly calling him a \u201cdummy dope.\u201d\n\nIn social media lingo, we might call this \u201cTwitter gold,\u201d the absolute peak of the social network\u2019s well-known propensity for drama. What would Twitter be without public figures like Trump who regularly launch into unexpected and unscripted diatribes on a moment\u2019s notice? In its finest moments, Twitter is a delivery mechanism for journalism and jokes but, at its worst, it is a global high school where bullies have armies and gossip can never be whispered, only shouted. And it\u2019s this latter version of Twitter where Trump reigns supreme.\n\nYou could say it\u2019s his natural element.\n\nBut Trump is nothing if not consistent in his erraticism and his Twitter rants have become a vital part of his brand.\n\nThe other presidential candidates are barred by the standards of human decorum from even considering a challenge to Trump\u2019s Twitter throne. Campaign stuffers are almost certainly managing their social media accounts whereas Trump himself\u2014or someone who has his voice perfected\u2014seems to be the one posting on @realDonaldTrump. (The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about Trump\u2019s Twitter account.)\n\nBut this also means that nothing interesting ever happens on the other candidates\u2019 carefully-curated Twitters where boilerplate quotes, logo spam, infographics, and tired hashtag campaigns are the name of the game.\n\nIt\u2019s hard (but perhaps also a little amusing) to picture Bernie Sanders letting loose on CNN and loudly calling people \u201cdummies.\u201d\n\nWith Trump, you might not get what you want but much like the proverbial box of chocolates, you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re going to get. And in the wilds of Twitter, the element of surprise still trumps all else.\n\nAs proof that Trump\u2019s Twitter is the medium\u2019s perfect drama-generating machine, consider his most frequently discussed topic: According to the Talkwalker report, Donald Trump\u2019s most-tweeted term since he called Mexican immigrants \u201crapists\u201d in his announcement speech is \u201cMacy\u2019s\u201d\u2014except, of course, for the words in his campaign slogan and generic words like \u201cpeople\u201d or \u201ccountry.\u201d\n\nIn early July, the department store dropped Trump\u2019s clothing brand due to his disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants, which predictably sent Trump on a Twitter tear. Over the last month, he has urged a boycott of the store, accused them of losing money (a cardinal sin in Trumpland), and tried to connect the store to the ongoing Planned Parenthood controversy:\n\nEach of these tweets has the power to launch a hundred replies and a dozen news posts. Trump almost certainly knows that and embraces it. Why should he use his Twitter for something other than settling grudge matches when all he apparently has to do to maintain his current level of support is bloviate?\n\nAs the country waits to hear how, exactly, Trump would #MakeAmericaGreatAgain, his campaign feeds on the perpetual controversy that only Twitter can supply. And for his loyal supporters, it doesn\u2019t matter what Trump says so much as how he says it.\n\nNowhere does this emphasis on tone over substance play more perfectly than on Twitter. Trump\u2019s brash, insulting online persona gives off the illusion of a straight shooter, someone unafraid to say what he thinks, and it\u2019s precisely that image that has helped him become the unexpected front-runner in the pre-primary polls. If Trump were the sort of candidate who made gaffes on television and apologized for them on Twitter, his campaign would have been over by now. But Trump is nothing if not consistent in his erraticism and his Twitter rants have become a vital part of his brand.\n\nIn fairness, Trump does use his Twitter for purposes besides bullying. When Wired examined the most influential anti-vaccine Twitter users who posted on their primary #CDCwhistleblower hashtag at its height, they found that Donald Trump\u2014himself an anti-vaxxer celebrity icon\u2014was one of the 10 most influential, with over 10 million impressions.\n\nPerhaps we should be grateful that Trump tweets more about Macy\u2019s than about policy.\n\nUltimately, there are no easy answers here, only the mirthless observation that Trump has found a technology that completes him and a platform where he has far more influence than any of the people who could actually become president. Trump and Twitter were made for each other and, as his poll numbers surge, that terrible symbiosis is more concerning than ever. With no way to escape the current Trump-storm, we can only take comfort in a nugget of wisdom carefully curated by none other than the Donald himself:", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:31.192+0000"}
{"entityId": 1763, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "So Hillary Clinton operates under her own set of rules? Funny. Jeb Bush and Rick Perry operated under rules that look awfully darn similar.\n\nSo as the dust begins to settle just a bit in the email scandal, the standard, agreed-upon line here is something like: The Clintons have one rule for themselves, and one rule for everybody else. Whatever people think about Hillary Clinton\u2019s degree of culpability here, this is the point in the conversation when the heads on cable television usually nod in unqualified agreement.\n\nBut is it really true, with regard to the specific question of email use? That\u2019s not so clear. We know, for example, that Secretary of State Colin Powell didn\u2019t turn over any emails to the department once the new law took effect in 2014, when Clinton handed over her 30,000 or so. So with respect to Powell, Clinton\u2019s conduct was more forthcoming.\n\nBut Powell isn\u2019t running for president, and he\u2019s out of public life except as a very occasional Official Voice of Reason. So fine, forget him. More saliently, let\u2019s compare Clinton to some other people who are in her position\u2014that is, in all likelihood running for president. Let\u2019s look specifically at Jeb Bush and Rick Perry, both former governors of large states that had decent freedom of information laws. And the comparisons, especially in Perry\u2019s case, don\u2019t mark Clinton\u2019s behavior out as uniquely egregious.\n\nBush, as we know, released a huge tranche of emails back in February from his time as governor. He did this not under any intense public microscope, certainly not after the appearance of an A1 Times story compelling him to do so. As such, he got points for transparency. In addition, he was known, when he was governor, for being pretty accessible via email to state officials and even to regular citizens. So he got credit for that, too. Fair enough.\n\nBut there are two specific ways in which Bush\u2019s conduct was no different from Clinton\u2019s. First, he, too, owns his own email server, as MSNBC reported, which hosts the personal address (not official state government address) on which he conducted much official, political, and personal business. The same thing many are saying now about Clinton\u2019s private set-up\u2014that it could insulate her from subpoenas and freedom-of-information requests\u2014would have been true of Bush\u2019s situation as well.\n\nBut second and more important, Bush and his staff decided which emails to make public, just as Clinton and her staff did. As Barbara Petersen of the Florida First Amendment Foundation told me: \u201cHe did the same thing Hillary did. Either he or his staff or he and his staff went through all of these emails and decided which were public record and which were not public record.\u201d\n\nNow let\u2019s move to Perry. The former Texas governor employed a very interesting email \u201cretention\u201d policy when he was in office\u2014all emails were automatically deleted after seven days. Joseph Larsen, a Houston attorney and a board member of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, told me Wednesday that he had long believed that Perry\u2019s policy was in violation of the retention requirements of the state\u2019s Public Information Act. In 2007 and 2008, he worked with a citizen-activist in Wisconsin of all places to try to force Perry to change the policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by what Clinton has done here,\u201d Larsen said to me. \u201cBut she\u2019s hardly alone.\u201d\n\nLarsen filed a complaint with the office of the state attorney general\u2014at the time, it was Republican Greg Abbott, who is now the governor. In June 2008, Larsen got a letter back from a deputy of Abbott\u2019s informing him that it was the AG\u2019s view that the governor was in full compliance with state law. Larsen shared the letter with me. Let\u2019s just say that if Clinton or her surrogates had tried some of these lines in the last few days, they\u2019d have become instant SNL material: \u201cAbsent a mechanism to discard non-critical information, the State of Texas would be overcome with its own records which must be maintained at taxpayer expense.\u201d And: \u201cA review of the Governor\u2019s Office records retention schedule shows that \u2018email\u2019 is not a specifically delineated records retention series.\u201d Ah, the meaning of \u201cemail,\u201d kind of like the meaning of \u201cis.\u201d But let\u2019s not be too hard on Abbott. When he became governor, he changed Perry\u2019s policy. Now, emails aren\u2019t deleted until after 30 whole days!\n\n\u201cI\u2019m appalled by what Clinton has done here,\u201d Larsen said to me. \u201cBut she\u2019s hardly alone.\u201d\n\nPeople might be right to be up in arms about Clinton\u2019s judgment. Certainly, the selective retention issue is a real one. It\u2019s not an unreasonable expectation that she should have realized this and taken steps at the time to preempt such questions\u2014asked a third party to decide what was and wasn\u2019t official business, maybe.\n\nBut if you\u2019re going to be up in arms about Clinton\u2019s practices, then shouldn\u2019t you be maybe a little bit up in arms about Bush\u2019s and Perry\u2019s? Bush, as we saw above, had some habits that were better than Clinton\u2019s, but at the end of the day, when it came time to turn emails over, as Barbara Petersen notes, he did the same self-sorting Clinton did. And Perry just dumped emails after seven days. Imagine if Clinton had done that! We\u2019d be hearing wall-to-wall denunciations that this was such a crisis that she should stand down from the presidential race.\n\nPeople can parse all the differences they want, and I\u2019ll grant that there may be legitimate differences. The main one being that as secretary of state, Clinton was conducting sensitive business on behalf of the entire American people, whereas being a governor, even of a big state, doesn\u2019t raise those kinds of questions, and most people don\u2019t care much about anything governors do.\n\nBut that\u2019s not really what this is about to most people who are rabid about it. This is about two things. To Republicans, it\u2019s about trying to find something on her on Benghazi. They\u2019re terrified\u2014with good reason\u2014that she\u2019s going to win 350 electoral votes and be the president for the next eight years, and they\u2019re grasping at anything they can that might block that from happening. And to the media, it\u2019s about their id\u00e9e fixe that the Clintons are uniquely corrupt\u2014in some (not all) mainstream media quarters, there\u2019s a 23-year-old emotional investment in this notion, buttressed by the conviction that the only reason that the most investigated couple in American political history isn\u2019t in jail is that they merely haven\u2019t yet been probed in quite the right way.\n\nBut really. Hillary operated under her own set of rules here? Funny.

Compared to the likely opposition, yes.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton launched her campaign for president this week, I thought, \u201cYep, there\u2019s the Obama coalition.\u201d Latinos (including a pair of brothers speaking Spanish), African Americans, Baby Boomers from the hippie segment, interracial couples, and a gay couple planning their wedding. My, how things have changed since 2008!\n\nWhat Clinton learned in defeat in her first presidential run was how much personality mattered to the people she wanted to vote for her. That included the young Millennials\u2014the oldest were not yet 30\u2014who are part of the most racially diverse generation in American history, are profoundly liberal on social issues, and whom Barack Obama helped make solidly Democratic.\n\nAnd yet, as hungry as they are for a woman president, and as ready as they are to vote Democratic, for these voters, there\u2019s often something that remains off-putting about Clinton\u2014more of the same. She stumbled in her 2008 campaign when she failed to convince these voters to come out for her in a big way, and could easily be challenged by a younger, more liberal, more human-seeming candidate.\n\nClinton was a terrible, sluggish candidate in 2008, and young voters famously compared her to their nagging mothers. After Obama defeated her for the nomination, she loosened up a bit. After he named her secretary of state, keeping her in the public eye and on his side, she became a little more cool. To win this time, especially the younger voters who swung for Obama\u2014who are now in their late 20s and early 30s\u2014and those too young to have voted for him, she\u2019s going to have to maintain that and be way less stuffy than she was in 2008.\n\nThe younger voters are important because they signal future trends, but also because motivating them to get to the polls could make all the difference. In low-turnout midterm elections, Republicans, who do well with older and whiter voters, win. But when the turnout is higher and the younger, browner America is better represented, Democrats can win more handily than expected, as Obama did in both his races.\n\nThere are hints in the video about some of the policy issues Clinton will broach, they\u2019re just softly indicated by the way the regular-seeming people in the video tell us what they care about.\n\nSo Clinton needs to motivate those younger voters to come to the polls and vote for her. How do those young voters feel about Obama now that his presidency is ending? What kind of cohort will Clinton inherit?\n\nMillennials are first of all more likely to be Democratic\u201451 percent identify as Democratic or Democratic-leaning, as opposed to 35 percent as Republican or Republican-leaning. Millennials are a big generation, and the younger half are more partisan than their slightly older peers: the number who identified as Dem or Dem-leaning inched up from 50 to 51 percent, those who leaned in the opposite direction toward Republicans went up from 13 percent to a still anemic 16 percent. Meanwhile, the number of undecideds fell, which makes sense in our highly partisan climate.\n\nDisappointment comes from various directions: Tom Sanchez, a filmmaker who lives in Los Angeles and is 34, told me he wants more liberal candidates in 2016. \u201cOverall, I have mixed feelings about Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cMy main disappointment is with his Wall Street policies\u2014they seem to be pretty much in line with Clinton/Bush.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to think that Obama disappoints because he promised the moon. I asked Millennials I know\u2014i.e., my friends and people I\u2019ve spoken to for other articles about Millennials\u2014but they told me that, whatever their disappointment level in Obama, it wasn\u2019t enough to disillusion them completely. One friend who is 34 said, \u201cThey [politicians] always over-promise. I am not starry-eyed. But I\u2019m basically never going to vote Republican, so....\u201d A woman from my hometown in Arkansas, Cira Abiseid, 31, told me she thinks Obama did the best he could under trying circumstances. \u201cI will never think I was too hopeful for change and progress,\u201d she says. \u201cWhether or not all of the things I wished for happened, I will always maintain hope that we can do better as a country.\u201d\n\nThe issues, too, are extremely important to this group of voters, so Clinton is right to subtly hint at those. On first glance, her announcement video seems bereft of policy. But there are hints about some of the policy issues Clinton will broach, they\u2019re just softly indicated by the way the regular-seeming people in the video tell us what they care about. There is a woman who\u2019s been a stay-at-home mom planning to go back to work\u2014that\u2019s child care and gender equity. There\u2019s the gay couple getting married\u2014marriage equality. (\u201cI never expected I\u2019d see a president that outwardly stood up for my right to marry,\u201d a friend, Ben Hall, who is 29 and works in Washington, D.C., told me. \u201cNo president has done more for the LGBTQ community than Obama has.\u201d)\n\nMore than a couple of business owners make an appearance, and there\u2019s a young soon-to-be college grad searching for jobs\u2014the economy, student loans. There\u2019s a mom who\u2019s moving so her daughter can go to a better school\u2014education. There\u2019s a couple expecting a baby\u2014family planning, about which Millennials care very much. On the interracial couples\u2014more than half of Millennials have dated outside their race. And these kinds of issues\u2014access to birth control, championing the issues female workers care about\u2014will put any Democratic candidate well ahead of the Republican field.\n\nThat\u2019s mostly, though, because Millennials really don\u2019t like Republicans. If they prefer Democratic candidates, it\u2019s often by default. The largest ideological grouping among Millennials is \u201cmixed,\u201d at 44 percent. The right Republican could appeal to them with a smart mix of sane economic and social policies. Republicans are going to push on Clinton\u2019s age\u2014she is 67 now\u2014and the fact that she\u2019s been a Washington insider for so long. And, sadly, expect sexism to nibble around the edges of her campaign, worrying voters over her capabilities.

I am running for president.\"\n\n\n\nThose attacks appear to be starting to leave a mark.\n\nFor most of the last two years, Clinton has held commanding polling leads, beating Republican contenders in some of the deepest red states, and occasionally even beating them in their home states. On Thursday, Quinnipiac released a series of polls that showed Clinton trailing or up only slightly in the key swing states of Colorado, Iowa and Virginia. And it wasn\u2019t just to top tier contenders like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio that Clinton suddenly found herself looking up at\u2014it was practically everyone, including longshots like Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz.\n\n\u201cThe campaign really already has begun,\u201d said Jim Hodges, a former Democratic governor of South Carolina. \u201cAll you need to do is witness the press coverage over the last six months. Despite their best efforts, their ability to stay above the fray proved to be pretty limited. It was simply impossible to stay out any longer.\u201d\n\nPeople in and close to the Clinton operation insist that the timing of the announcement had little to do with any of these factors. Clinton will be inheriting a political operation as ready to make her the nominee any candidate in history. Outside groups have been raising tens of millions of dollars on Clinton\u2019s behalf, and the grassroots outfit Ready for Hillary has signed up four million supporters.\n\nRather, they say, the campaign was ready to launch when the campaign was ready to launch: when the website was completed, when the staff hires were all made and the rollout planned down to the smallest detail.\n\nBy late Friday, the official response from the Clinton headquarters was that there was still no official campaign, even as dozens of staffers had been hired and The New York Times spotted people working in her new Brooklyn campaign office.\n\nLast month, Clinton made what would turn out to be her final appearance as a non-candidate. It was in Brooklyn, miles from where her new headquarters would be. She appeared at a children\u2019s center to promote childhood literacy, and despite the insistence of her aides that she would not take questions, one intrepid journalist asked when she would return to the borough to open her campaign headquarters.\n\n\u201cAll in good time, all in good time,\u201d Clinton responded with a smile before hustling out of the room.\n\nThe good times are apparently here.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:32.334+0000"}

He also signed legislation the poured millions into programs for breast and cervical cancer research as well as some that helped low-income women afford cancer treatments.\n\nThe trouble began with a gaffe Jeb made during a conversation about Planned Parenthood at the Send North America Conference for conservative Christians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we need a half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health programs,\u201d he said casually.\n\nRight on cue, the outrage machine started churning.\n\nDemocrats wasted no time pouncing, grateful to go on the offense about health issues after spending weeks dogged by Planned Parenthood sting videos. Bush supporters shook their heads\u2014acutely aware that those comments would promptly come back to haunt him.\n\nBush quickly walked back the comment, saying he had misspoken and wasn\u2019t talking about all women\u2019s health programs.\n\n\u201cI was referring to the hard-to-fathom $500 million in federal funding that goes to Planned Parenthood\u2014an organization that was callously participating in the unthinkable practice of selling fetal organs,\u201d Bush said in a statement. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans agree we absolutely must defund them and redirect those funds to other women\u2019s health organizations.\u201d\n\nHe and Hillary Clinton had a Twitter fight over it, too. \u201c.@JebBush: You are absolutely, unequivocally wrong,\u201d she wrote on Tuesday.\n\nBush replied with what he\u2019s always said about abortion.\n\n\u201c.@HillaryClinton what\u2019s absolutely, unequivocally wrong is giving taxpayer $ to an org whose practices show no regard for lives of unborn,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe former governor\u2019s record on funding for women\u2019s health issues and research largely belies his odd gaffe\u2014and the criticism it\u2019s drawn highlights just how central abortion politics could be to 2016.\n\nAs Florida governor, Bush did slash funding for Planned Parenthood. But he also won plaudits from community health centers for helping them access federal money.\n\nAnd he signed legislation investing millions in programs aiming to fight breast and cervical cancer and to fund cancer research.\n\nIt\u2019s a record that has something for everyone to love or hate: funds for crisis pregnancy centers, funds for abstinence-only sex ed, money directed to cancer research, and cash withdrawn from Planned Parenthood.\n\nLike Governor Scott Walker\u2014and unlike Senate Republicans\u2014Bush can take credit for keeping some tax dollars away from Planned Parenthood\u2014a fact that checks a critical box in the Republican primary. As The Huntington Post noted , Bush diverted $124,000 from Planned Parenthood of Southwest and Central Florida in 2002, directing that money to abstinence-only sex ed programs. He also signed legislation letting Floridians pay a fee to get \u201cChoose Life\u201d license plates, per PolitiFact Florida . The proceeds from that project went to anti-abortion crisis pregnancy centers.\n\n\u201cBush\u2019s comments were no \u2018ad lib,\u2019\u201d said Jess McIntosh, vice president for communications at EMILY\u2019s List, in a statement. \u201cIn fact, he spent his career as governor eroding women\u2019s access to health care and has made it a cornerstone of his presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nBut, as PolitiFact notes , Bush also budgeted millions for a crisis pregnancy hotline that directed women to those centers. Besides the pro-life license plates, Bush also signed off on the creation of \u201cEnd Breast Cancer\u201d plates. According to the Florida Breast Cancer Foundation , those plates have generated $4 million.\n\nBush oversaw the direction of significant amounts of investment in women\u2019s cancer research and prevention. He signed the Mary Brogan Breast And Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Act, which\u2014 per the American Cancer Society\u2019s Cancer Action Network \u2014helped needy women with breast and cervical cancer get treatment. He also oversaw implementation of the Bankhead-Coley Cancer Research Program , which received $36 million from 2006 to 2010 and helped fund breast cancer research.\n\nBut his decisions regarding cancer research funding weren\u2019t without criticism. In 2005, he vetoed $30,000 that would have funded a cervical cancer task force. And Democratic state Representative Anne Gannon had harsh criticism for that move.\n\nAndrew Behrman, president and CEO of Florida Association of Community Health Centers, said Bush was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in helping pass legislation to get those centers more funding to serve low-income patients.\n\n\u201cThe governor is greatly detached from the health issues that face women and this veto clearly shows his disconnect,\u201d she said, according to The Gainesville Sun .\n\nAnd in 2004, The Tampa Bay Times reported, he used his line-item veto power to cut $2 million in funding that would have gone to the University of Miami\u2019s Braman Family Breast Cancer Institute.\n\nStill, the governor won plaudits from the Florida Association of Community Health Centers for helping their clinics secure funding. Andrew Behrman, the group\u2019s president and CEO, said Bush was \u201cinstrumental\u201d in helping pass legislation to get those centers more funding to serve low-income patients.\n\n\u201cHe was right there telling us, we can do this,\u201d Behrman said. \u201cHe signed the bill immediately and it was a big help to us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just been supportive,\u201d Behrman added.\n\n3So while Bush\u2019s record on women\u2019s health issues is a little more complex than his garbled comments might have suggested, this is a presidential campaign where nuance exists in theory but rarely in practice\u2014and where a 30-second speak-o can obscure millions of dollars spent on cancer research and prevention.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:32.844+0000"}

Paul was not the likeliest Hawkeye hero: a marionette-looking, libertarian-leaning obstetrician obsessed with Austrian economics who stuck out like Ayn Rand on a welfare line in the land of pink-faced Christians like Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum.\n\nBut Paul managed to locate an untapped vein of enthusiasm in the caucus state and used that to construct a grassroots apparatus that threatened to upset the GOP establishment. He visited colleges, converting young people with his message of small government and non-interventionism abroad\u2014the latter being particularly appealing to voters who had spent the majority of their lives with their country at war in the Middle East during the George W. Bush administration. It looked, for a time, like he might win\u2026. But then he came in third.\n\nThree years later it\u2019s Paul\u2019s son, Rand Paul, the eye doctor-cum-senator from Kentucky, who is vying for the Republican nomination. Paul\u2019s task is this: keep the supporters he inherited from his father happy while converting enough new supporters to win.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going so well in Iowa, where Paul will land on April 10 as part of his \u201cNational Stand with Rand Tour,\u201d wherein he is expected to formally declare, on April 7 in Kentucky, that he is running for president.\n\nMany of Rand\u2019s father\u2019s operatives linger, and all has not been forgotten on the ground in Iowa.\n\nPolitico\u2019s Ben Schreckinger reported on March 26 that Drew Ivers, the chairman of the elder Paul's 2012 campaign in Iowa, has already jumped ship because of Paul\u2019s shape-shifting: \u201cHe\u2019s moderating most of [his positions], not taking a real clear stance on a number of them,\u201d Ivers told Schreckinger. \u201cThe strategy of sending a blended message is one that has risk.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Paul has lost the support of Iowa Ron Paul-ites State Senator Jason Shultz and former Iowa GOP central committee members Chad Steenhoek and Joel Kurtinitis, Schreckinger reported. All three of them view Ted Cruz, who announced his candidacy last week, as the greener pasture.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being pulled in two different directions,\u201d Craig Robinson, a former chairman of the Iowa GOP, told me of Paul.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, he wants to be more mainstream, but every step he takes to be more mainstream puts him in conflict with his father\u2019s base of supporters.\u201d\n\nRobinson said it seems unlikely such a plan could succeed in Iowa.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really kind of, in Iowa, running a two-pronged campaign. How do you keep two sets of people happy who don\u2019t see eye to eye?\u201d\n\nIn particular, Iowa caucus voters\u2014of whom there are only about 150,000 for the candidates to claw each other to the death over\u2014tend to value social conservatism more than the \u201clibertarian-ish\u201d stuff he\u2019s selling. In a sense Ted Cruz, slimy and demonic as he may be, possesses exactly what Paul needs: the feeling of a party outsider, but with evangelical credibility. Paul\u2019s awkward attempts to reassure both groups that he is one of them will inevitably, it seems, leave at least one feeling cold.\n\nWe saw a preview of this awkwardness just last week, when Paul met with a group of evangelical leaders to discuss gay marriage. He told them he believed Washington should play a role in fixing the \u201cmoral crisis\u201d\u2014a remarkable shift from his usual libertarian-approved position, which is that the federal government should stay the hell out of it. But Paul\u2019s phrasing was really all about the crowd he was addressing. After the talk, his campaign assured me and other reporters that despite what it sounded like, Paul still believed what he always believed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult to keep the Ron Paul supporters from 2008 and 2012 happy. Yes, they\u2019re libertarians, but I also think in their nature they\u2019re a little contrarian: Supporting Ron Paul was kind of giving the middle finger to the establishment. Rand Paul wants to be viewed as a sort of respectable person who can win the nomination.\u201d Ron Paul supporters, Robinson admitted, \u201cprobably wouldn\u2019t like it if you said [voting for him] was a protest vote, but in some sense it was appealing.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s camp, of course, denies that mastering this bizarre game is difficult.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much ado about nothing!\u201d Steve Grubbs, Paul\u2019s Iowa strategist, told me by phone. \u201cWe have called through to many [party] chairs, we have seen polling data, and Rand Paul is doing very well with former Ron Paul voters. It\u2019s a pretty good base, and I can tell you this: The plan for Rand Paul is not to rely solely on Ron Paul voters. He has an appeal to voters that supported his father and voters that didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nGrubbs and the rest of Paul-World claim to view his ability to be an ideological chameleon as having no downside. \u201cThere were a lot of people who were favorable to Ron Paul but were not convinced he could win. Rand Paul brings in a whole new group of voters who understand that he could take this all the way to the White House,\u201d Grubbs said.\n\nBeyond the question of whether or not Paul\u2019s attempt to fool\u2014or convince, if you are so kind\u2014various groups of voters into thinking he represents them will be successful in Iowa, there is the question of whether the ghosts of his dad\u2019s last campaign could come back to haunt them.\n\nIn 2012 just before the caucus, State Senator Kent Sorenson, a well-known Michele Bachmann supporter, abruptly jumped ship to join Ron Paul\u2019s movement. His support, it turned out, had been purchased for $73,000 (legal technically, but a violation of Iowa ethics rules).\n\nEmails were later leaked implying that Jesse Benton, the campaign chairman, knew of the payments. In the wake of Sorenson\u2019s guilty plea in 2014, Benton (who denied multiple interview requests for this article) resigned from the campaign of Mitch McConnell. To make matters more complicated: Benton wasn\u2019t just a Paul campaign operative, but, having married Ron Paul\u2019s granddaughter, he was family. And he was expected to eventually join Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign.\n\nWhile it seems Benton will have no role in the upcoming race, many of Rand\u2019s father\u2019s operatives linger, and all has not been forgotten on the ground in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s very clear that the [2012] campaign operated very fast and loose,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe fact that Rand has guys who are wrapped up in that would concern me greatly.\u201d All it would take to \u201cderail a campaign\u201d like Paul\u2019s, he went on, would be \u201cone little news story or investigation into one of these guys.\u201d\n\nA source close to both Ron and Rand Paul told me that what happened in Iowa in 2012 should not be of concern to those considering supporting Rand in 2016: \u201cNo one who works for Senator Paul has been accused of anything. It doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense to say, \u2018Well, they probably didn\u2019t do anything wrong, but he should have kept Ron\u2019s people off his team three and a half years later.\u2019\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:33.109+0000"}

Think of Ronald Reagan\u2019s descent into the Iran-Contra scandal or Bill Clinton\u2019s pathetic parsing of his \u201cinappropriate relationship\u201d with Monica Lewinsky.\n\nOr Barack Obama\u2019s rising bile in response to the obstructionism of Washington Republicans, manifested as a display of unleashed id, ungoverned by tactful superego, in his hilariously angry comic performance Saturday night at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner\u2014during which he repeated over and over an expression that sounded dangerously close to \u201cFuck it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWelcome to the fourth quarter of my presidency,\u201d the president addressed the 2,700 or so gussied-up dinner-goers in the basement ballroom of the Washington Hilton\u2014prompting a triumphant whoop from the dais. \u201cThat was Michelle cheering,\u201d he ad-libbed\u2014accurately.\n\n\u201cI am determined to make the most of every moment I have left,\u201d he went on. \u201cAfter the midterm elections my advisers asked me, \u2018Mr. President, do you have a bucket list?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Well, I have something that rhymes with \u2018bucket list.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe room exploded with a roar of recognition. Nearly everyone, with the possible exception of starry-eyed first-timers\u2014namely, weary politicians and jaded journalists, greasy lobbyists and greedy corporate executives, honored guests and shameless party-crashers, plus a dwindling contingent of A-list celebs\u2014seemed to be feeling the same thing.\n\nCall it, for lack a better term, the \u201cfuck it\u201d phase of the Washington political cycle, as reliable and inevitable as 17-year cicadas.\n\n\u201cThe Obama people are really bitter,\u201d one of Washington\u2019s savvier journalists informed me after encountering Ben Rhodes, the press-handling deputy White House national security adviser, hanging out in the smoking area of the MSNBC after-party, puffing on a cigarette. \u201cThey\u2019re like an \u201980s rock band. Nobody cares anymore.\u201d\n\nAlso at the ear-splitting MSNBC do\u2014where the younger folks danced to Beyonce\u2019s \u201cSingle Ladies\u201d\u2014Comcast government relations chief David Cohen held court on the top tier of a cavernous three-tiered party space.\n\nHe responded tersely when asked why the cable and media behemoth, which swallowed up NBC Universal four years ago, failed in its attempt to acquire Time Warner Cable.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not here to talk about that,\u201d Cohen said, two days after he was forced to acknowledge defeat after a dispiriting meeting with Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler, ironically a former cable industry lobbyist. \u201cWe got a great company. Movin\u2019 on!\u201d\n\nThe shocking thing about the deal\u2019s collapse was that even the fiercest opponents of the Comcast-TWC merger, notably telecomm expert and visiting Harvard Law School professor Susan Crawford, believed that Cohen\u2019s multimillion-dollar war chest and army of lobbyists would be unstoppable.\n\n\u201cWe have a weird relationship,\u201d Cohen said about Crawford. \u201cI\u2019ve never met her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Obama people are really bitter. They\u2019re like an \u201980s rock band. Nobody cares anymore.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, after the once and current chief of NBC News, Andy Lack, came and went, various NBC News and MSNBC types speculated that a story in that morning\u2019s New York Times, reporting that the internal investigation of Brian Williams\u2019s embellishments was discovering further instances of fabrication, was a purposeful leak from Comcast or NBC Universal upper management.\n\n\u201cIt seems like somebody wants Andy Lack to understand, in case he feels otherwise, that Brian can\u2019t come back,\u201d one NBC Kremlinologist told me, noting that the suspended Nightly News anchor and Lack have been close friends since the latter\u2019s first seven-year term running the news division in the 1990s.\n\nInterim anchor Lester Holt, meanwhile, smiled mutely, in a decorous lip-zipping manner, when a partygoer suggested he should get the job permanently.\n\nA poignant sensation of what Jimmy Carter might have described as \u201cmalaise\u201d seemed to hang over many of these social gatherings that occupied the endless Washington weekend\u2014expensively catered, generously liquored, elaborately produced and cheek-by-jowl, to be sure, but also celebrations that sometimes seemed forced and hollow.\n\nThen again, maybe it was just me\u2014although it\u2019s also true that the cast of The Walking Dead was impossible to avoid during the party rounds.\n\nAnd, of course, who could ignore the amazingly thatch-roofed Donald Trump and his glittering wife, Melania? Certainly not the president, who affected mild surprise that they even showed up, four years after Obama eviscerated the Celebrity Apprentice star at a previous White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner over his constant harping on that birth certificate issue. \u201cAnd Donald Trump is here. Still,\u201d Obama quipped, to laughter.\n\nAs Trump made his way past the magnetometers and down a staircase into the ballroom, he was clearly in a fabulous mood\u2014the best!\u2014happy to be besieged by admirers and/or curiosity seekers inquiring about his presidential campaign plans and demanding selfies.\n\nIs 2016 finally the year when he\u2019ll finally take the plunge?\n\n\u201cYou watch!\u201d Trump advised, adding cheerfully, \u201cI know you\u2019ve written some nasty things about me\u2014but overall, good!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no comment about it,\u201d Melania told me with a grin when I asked about her prospective campaign for First Lady.\n\nABC News White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, who obligingly took snapshots of Trump and his fans with other people\u2019s iPhones when not posing for grip-and-grins with the Trumps himself, reported: \u201cHe says he\u2019s serious.

Whatever your politics\u2014or your age\u2014good on her.\n\nClinton sounds like an old-style unreconstructed liberal who will tax, spend, and regulate like it\u2019s 1969.\n\nIf and when her challengers and critics play the age card, Clinton would be well advised to update Reagan\u2019s playbook. \u201cThomas Jefferson once said, \u2018We should never judge a president by his age, only by his works,\u2019\u201d Reagan counseled once. \u201cAnd ever since he told me that, I stopped worrying.\u201d After being asked in a 1984 debate about whether he was too old and tired to remain in office, Reagan delivered a humorous smackdown that effectively ended that line of questioning. \u201cI will not make age an issue in this campaign,\u201d deadpanned Reagan. \u201cI am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience.\u201d\n\nContrary to claims made by his son Ron Reagan Jr. and floated in medical journals, there\u2019s no proof that Reagan suffered from dementia during his presidency (or, same thing, the same evidence suggests mental impairment dating back to the 1980 campaign). In any case, there\u2019s little reason to believe that Hillary Clinton\u2019s opponents, whether Democratic or Republican, will attack her physical or mental fitness.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that she\u2019s immune from age-based attacks. Not on her person, but on her ideas, which are at least as \u201cstale and moss-covered\u201d in their own way as Rand Paul says the Republican Party has become. Looking over her left shoulder at progressive Democrats such as Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Clinton often sounds like she is auditioning to implement Barack Obama\u2019s third term. Where her husband long ago heralded the \u201cera of big government is over\u201d and proceeded not simply to balance the budget but drive down federal expenditures as a percentage of GDP to well-below averages (see page 345) (PDF), Clinton sounds like an old-style unreconstructed liberal who will tax, spend, and regulate like it\u2019s 1969.\n\nShe has long spoken about the need to maintain current old-age entitlements despite their impending fiscal collapse and the unfairness of a system that robs the relatively young and poor to gild the golden years of the relatively old and wealthy. In a country that favors pot legalization, she is still an unapologetic drug warrior and her late-breaking conversion to marriage equality (like Obama\u2019s) smacks more of political opportunism that principle.\n\nShe\u2019s spoken vociferously against Edward Snowden but has not clarified her stance on the National Security Agency (NSA) programs he revealed and, even more important, has not yet explained where she stands on the interventionist foreign policy she stood for both as a senator from New York and as secretary of state. Despite arguably one of the most impressive resumes imaginable for the job of president, there\u2019s very little about Clinton that screams out a 21st-century vision of government. As with her GOP counterpart in dynastic politics, she seems a throwback to the last century, not someone who will boldly move into the future.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s not Hillary Clinton\u2019s aging body that\u2019s an issue, even as she will likely square off against a Republican challenger who might be six years (Bush), 15 years (Rand Paul), or even 23 years (Marco Rubio) younger. It\u2019s her aging ideas and policies that may cause her to stumble going forward. Lucky for her that virtually all of her opponents, despite being years younger than she is, are trading almost exclusively in ideas and rhetoric that are even more backward-looking and reeking of cultural and intellectual mothballs.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:33.761+0000"}

Russia? China? North Korea? Should we start an international campaign to pressure a foreign government, or marauding gangs, or human smuggling cartels to do the right thing? #FreeTheMoms?\n\nThink closer to home. This phenomenon \u2014 moms in detention \u2014 is happening here in the United States, in federal facilities located in states like Texas and New Mexico.\n\nThese women and children are being effectively kept as prisoners, even though they don\u2019t have lawyers or charges lodged against them. This kind of lockup sounds like such a dreadful punishment. What terrible crime did they commit?\n\nThey believed. They crossed into the United States last summer \u2014 along with more than 80,000 uninvited guests, almost entirely other women and children from Central America \u2014 because they believed what they had heard about how the United States was a safe haven for refugees fleeing oppression, death, horror.\n\nCentral America has all of the above, especially in recent years now that violent youth gangs and drug cartels are warring for control of countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. It\u2019s the kind of place where young girls are sexually assaulted, and young boys are recruited into gangs with an offer they can\u2019t refuse: join up or watch your family die. It\u2019s the kind of place where mothers scrape their fingers bloody rubbing rosary beads as they pray to the saints to keep their children safe. Over the last couple of years, thousands of mothers have grabbed their children and a few personal belongings and headed north, through Mexico and into the United States across the Texas border.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know from news accounts, government records, and the testimony of refugees themselves.\n\nThe first wave, which arrived approximately between October 2013 and April 2014, took U.S. immigration officials by surprise. And so, the first instinct was to get rid of them by doing what the law allows \u2014 transferring them into the custody of U.S.-based relatives with a notice to appear before an immigration judge at some future date. Many of those who were released in this fashion never showed for their court appearance and instead blended into the sizable population of undocumented immigrants in the United States.\n\nOf course, there is no excuse for failing to appear\u2014even though, in some well-publicized cases, the assigned court was more than 1000 miles from where the defendant was located. The point is that, once these refugees were released from custody, it was easy for them to disappear. Perhaps the authorities saw this as a mistake that they didn\u2019t want to repeat with the waves that followed.\n\nNow team Obama has finally found a way to keep families intact: just lock up mothers and children together in makeshift family prisons.\n\nThe final wave, which arrived after September 2014, were immediately arrested and deported back to their home countries in a showy and well-organized repatriation effort intended to send a message to the people who still lived there and might have been contemplating a journey of their own to the United States: \u201cDon\u2019t come. You will be apprehended and sent home.\u201d Before long, the flow of refugees from families from Central America dried up to a trickle.\n\nIn between those two waves \u2014 of those who were let go and those who were sent home \u2014 was the middle wave of refugees, those who arrived approximately between April and August 2014. These are the people who came in droves, the ones you saw on the news steaming across the Texas-Mexico border last summer.\n\nEver wonder what happened to them? Many of them were apprehended and, instead of being deported, they were placed in makeshift detention facilities. For a time, even some abandoned military bases were converted to house these refugee families. More recently, they have been placed in federal detention facilities. And forgotten.\n\nThere are activists who have traveled to the towns where these centers are based and tried to gain access to the detainees. When they can provide humanitarian aid, they do.\n\nI spoke to one activist who has made the pilgrimage, and who is himself undocumented. He believes that these centers need to shut down because of what allegedly occurs there.\n\nOne of the more notorious detention facilities is the Karnes County Residential Center, located about 100 miles south of Austin. In October, several immigration advocacy groups fired off a letter to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security, which hired a for-profit prison operator to run the facility. The groups allege that women are being sexually abused and otherwise mistreated by guards at the facility. The company, Geo Group Inc., denies the allegations and insists that the Karnes Center \u201cprovides a safe, clean, and family-friendly environment for mothers and children.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ll find liberals who are concerned about closing the military prison at Guantanamo Bay but who are not comparably worked up over, for instance, what\u2019s happening to women and children at institutions like Karnes.\n\nYou have to hand it to the Obama administration. In the last six-and-a-half years, it has racked up a record 2 million deportations and divided hundreds of thousands of families. Now team Obama has finally found a way to keep families intact: just lock up mothers and children together in makeshift family prisons.\n\nAnd now, the administration has come up with a Mother\u2019s Day present for the thousands of immigrant women, and children it has incarcerated in detention facilities: a slap in the face.\n\nThe gift was delivered not by courier but by lawyers, which is rarely a good sign. The lawyers, who work at the Justice Department, have maintained that the child refugees being held in detention don\u2019t have a due process right to counsel under the Constitution. And so they asked U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly to dismiss in its entirety a lawsuit challenging the Obama administration\u2019s policy of rushing thousands of incarcerated children into deportation proceedings without first giving them legal representation. The judge refused to do so.\n\nThe attorneys recently requested that Zilly stay all further court action on the due process claims of these women and children until Justice can appeal his ruling. The judge has said that the right-to-counsel claim is too important to be put off much longer. A decision on the request for a stay should be forthcoming.\n\nIt seems like a lot of trouble for the U.S. government to go to, all so it can do as it pleases with people who are weak and vulnerable \u2014 child refugees, most of whom don\u2019t speak English or understand what\u2019s happening to them.\n\nThis is not the Obama administration\u2019s finest hour. It stands taller when it defends immigrants and refugees, not when it is going to such extraordinary lengths to remove them or turning a blind eye to those who are alleged to have abused them.\n\nAs for those Justice Department lawyers, well, you have to wonder how they sleep at night. This is why they went to law school? This is how they\u2019re using their legal training\u2014trying to deny representation to a bunch of kids?\n\nTheir own mothers must be very proud.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:34.211+0000"}

And some might suggest that is a rarity in politics today, but Ronald Reagan did it, Rand Paul does it, and I do it.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about some of his off-color comments, Sanborn paused for several seconds.\n\n\u201cAnd your point is?\u201d he eventually said. \u201cI have made my mistakes. There is no question I am as human as anyone else. I think people today are tired of the wailing and gnashing to teeth of political activists trying to disparage someone on the other side of the aisle.\u201d\n\nNot all of the trouble that Sanborn has found himself in stem from things he has said\u2014nor do they all come from Democrats in New Hampshire.\n\nIn 2010, his fellow Republicans tried to redistrict Sanborn out of his seat by putting him into a much more Democratic district. So Sanborn moved across the state, to a friendlier district, and won.\n\nIn 2004, Sanborn, a Porsche and Ferrari collector, abruptly shut down a chain of bike and ski stores he owned\u2014workers showed up only to find the doors locked\u2014citing poor health.\n\nThe shop\u2019s suppliers took him to court to recover money he owed them. The lawyer for the equipment suppliers told The Concord Monitor at the time that Sanborn\u2019s goal was to make enough money in the closing sale to pay off his bank loan, and then once the case landed in bankruptcy court, ensure that the suppliers only received a fraction of what he owed them.\n\nRegardless, Sanborn\u2019s health soon recovered, and he didn\u2019t retire as promised, but ran for the state legislature and opened up a popular sports bar in the capital city of Concord called The Draft.\n\nWhen it opened, Sanborn described it to the local alternative weekly as a place from \u201ca slightly older era\u2026 ten or fifteen years ago, [when] women actually got dressed up to go out at night, and put makeup on. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a bad thing.\u201d\n\nIn the most recent campaign, Sanborn received criticism for putting out a negative mailer that featured a dark-skinned man in a hoodie glaring out next to a picture of his Democratic opponent in order to paint him as soft on crime. Democrats discovered that the image came from a Getty image search for \u201cMenacing Hoodie.\u201d\n\nThat same year Democrats also hit Sanborn, whose wife is also in the state legislature, for failing to pay his property taxes 25 times over the previous 20 years, despite repeated promises to do so.\n\nRegardless, it is no secret why Paul picked Sanborn to help lead his charge in New Hampshire.\n\nAs many local Republicans bide their time before deciding who to endorse, Sanborn has already become one of Paul\u2019s most prominent backers in the state GOP. Plus, Sanborn has staked a claim as one of the most anti-tax lawmakers in a vociferously anti-tax state, leading the charge to repeal a state tax on small businesses that incorporate.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you in Washington, D.C., who is a Republican and who is a Democrat,\u201d Sanborn said. Paul, he added, was different.\n\n\u201cThere is a consistency to him which I think is incredible. He truly believes and understands not just the Constitution, but respecting it in a way that brings back the traditional values that are important to us.\u201d\n\nSanborn also said that he hadn\u2019t yet planned out what he was going to say at the big rally on Wednesday for Paul.\n\n\u201cAs you can probably tell, I am more of a shoot-from-the-hip kind of guy.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:34.367+0000"}

But The Donald is not America\u2019s first showman turned politician.\n\nOne Trump role model, the 19th-century entrepreneurial egotist P.T. Barnum, parlayed his fame as a bigmouth impresario into actual political power, serving two terms in the Connecticut legislature and one term as the mayor of Bridgeport. Having labeled himself \u201ca bit of a P.T. Barnum, I make stars out of everyone,\u201d Trump should learn from his self-promoting predecessor. For all his shenanigans as the ultimate flimflam man, Phineas T. Barnum was one classy, downright idealistic, politician.\n\nBarnum, born on July 5, 1810, is most famous today for the circus he only began in his 60s and a phrase he never coined. The man incorrectly credited with having said \u201cThere is a sucker born every minute,\u201d built his reputation as America\u2019s greatest promoter, welcoming thousands into \u201cBarnum\u2019s American Museum\u201d in the 1840s, stuffed with more than half a million oddities, and earning half a million dollars in the 1850s by making the soprano Jenny Lind a popular sensation.\n\nThe Great American Shtickmeister, Barnum entertained the masses spectacularly while manipulating them lovingly. He turned an articulate, 2-foot-tall, 16-pound 5-year-old (and distant relative) Charles Stratton into an international celebrity, \u201cGeneral\u201d Tom Thumb. He wowed crowds with faked genetic anomalies including Joice Heth, an elderly African-American woman he claimed was George Washington\u2019s 161-year-old former nurse. There was \u201cthe Feejee Mermaid,\u201d half-monkey, half-fish, all faux mummified. Barnum delighted our usually thrifty, sober, and sour forebears with his money-making chutzpah, moving lingering museum goers out by luring them with signs proclaiming \u201cThis Way to the Egress,\u201d a fancy word for exit.\n\nBarnum supplemented his discerning eye for the compelling spectacle with a great ear for enduring aphorisms. America\u2019s self-proclaimed \u201cPrince of Humbug\u201d shamelessly, greedily, said \u201cevery crowd has a silver lining.\u201d He admitted: \u201cWithout promotion, something terrible happens... Nothing.\u201d Refuting conmen who had long observed how frequently suckers were spawned, Barnum offered the kinder, gentler insight that \u201cthere\u2019s a customer born every minute.\u201d\n\nSurprisingly, this money-hungry \u201cshowman by profession\u201d was an abolitionist reformer who helped establish the Republican Party as America\u2019s leading liberal party.\n\nBarnum\u2019s crowning entertainment achievement originated with his launch of \u201cP.T. Barnum\u2019s Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan & Hippodrome,\u201d in Delavan, Wisconsin, in 1870. What he soon labeled \u201cThe Greatest Show on Earth\u201d was also one of the world\u2019s most lucrative. It grossed more than $400,000 its first year. By 1875, this traveling circus was reaching a hundred towns annually with its distinctive three rings. Six years later, Barnum merged his show with James Bailey\u2019s operation. In 1907, yet another merger created \u201cRingling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\u201d\n\nBarnum peddled his story as enthusiastically as he promoted his exhibitions. One hundred and twenty-four years before Donald Trump published How to Get Rich, Barnum published the Art of Money Getting, or, Golden Rules for Making Money in 1880. Then, as now, rather than indulging in European-style class envy, most Americans preferred to try mastering the secret recipe for joining the ranks of the rich and famous (and narcissistic).\n\nSurprisingly, this money-hungry \u201cshowman by profession\u201d was an abolitionist reformer who helped establish the Republican Party as America\u2019s leading liberal party.\n\nBy 1854, Barnum stopped being a Democrat. The Party\u2019s reactionary racism disgusted him. Eleven years and one Civil War later, he still believed in a Democratic Party that \u201cgoes for the greatest good to the greatest number, for equal and exact justice to all men, and for a submission to the will of the majority.\u201d\n\nBarnum supported the unknown one-term Whig Congressman Abraham Lincoln for president in 1860. During that charged campaign, torch-bearing Republican \u201cWide Awakes\u201d paraded in town after town, asking supporters to demonstrate their loyalty by illuminating their homes along main streets. Barnum lit candles in every window in his Bridgeport home. Learning that one Democratic neighbor had sent the servants into the basement to keep the entire house dark at street-level, Barnum dispatched a mutual friend to distract the Democrat and his wife. Barnum then bathed that house in lights, leading the marching Wide Awakes to welcome this new convert. When Barnum\u2019s Democratic dupe heard three cheers for him from his despised rivals, he saw in horror that his home was as illuminated as any Republican\u2019s.\n\nAs the war ended in 1865, Barnum ran for the Connecticut Legislature so that he could vote to ratify the 13th Amendment banning slavery. In a moving speech, urging full rights and proper education for newly-freed slaves, Barnum said he fell to his knees in gratitude when the motion passed. He predicted that as \u201cthe educated free negro\u201d thrived in \u201cschools and workshops,\u201d paying taxes and voting regularly, \u201che will put to everlasting shame the champions of modern Democracy, by the overwhelming evidence\u201d that \u201cA human soul, \u2018that God has created and Christ died for,\u2019 is not to be trifled with. It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot\u2014it is still an immortal spirit; and, amid all assumptions of caste, it will in due time vindicate the great fact that, without regard to color or condition, all men are equally children of the common Father.\u201d\n\nIn 1875, the 63-year-old, pro-Suffragette Barnum became Bridgeport\u2019s reforming mayor. He was also a newlywed, having married a 22-year-old, barely 13 weeks after his wife of 44 years died suddenly. Barnum campaigned to close saloons, ban prostitution, give prisoners meaningful work, and modernize utilities, especially the water system.\n\nClearly\u2014Donald Trump take note\u2014biography is not destiny; previous jobs don\u2019t determine political positions; and egotism need not trump humanism. P.T. Barnum was as self-absorbed and self-aggrandizing as Donald Trump, with an ego as monumental as any of Trump\u2019s towers.

Yet evangelical elites\u2019 stature within the GOP coalition assures that the party will cater to some\u2014though not all\u2014of their priorities.\n\nCruz announced his candidacy to a packed convocation at Liberty University. Founded by Jerry Falwell, the famed fundamentalist pastor and political operative who died in 2007, the Lynchburg, Virginia, campus is a bastion of cultural conservatism. The optics of Cruz\u2019s speech, which reporters likened to a sermon, were clearly designed to highlight his evangelical bona fides.\n\nAmericans, and especially Republican primary voters, will now take a closer look at Cruz.\n\nWell-known in political circles for his Tea Party-fueled campaign for Senate in 2012, Ted Cruz defied the Beltway expectation that freshmen senators should learn the ropes, quietly deferring to and learning from party elders. Instead, Cruz quickly jumped headlong and uninvited into high-profile political fights, taking it upon himself to help sabotage the Senate\u2019s relationship with the Obama administration and with the House of Representatives.\n\nNever missing an opportunity to grandstand, Cruz has shown that he has the ambition and sense of self-importance to think himself the best person for the job, but only his most ardent supporters could possibly think he seems \u201cpresidential.\u201d\n\nCruz\u2019s path to the GOP nomination (if there is one) centers around one goal: becoming the conservative movement\u2019s alternative to the party establishment\u2019s candidate of choice. Unfortunately for Cruz, it will not work.\n\nWith varying degrees of success, GOP presidential aspirants titillate conservative evangelicals with the idea that someone who shares their values could become president. A generation ago, Pat Robertson and Patrick Buchanan gave voice to grassroots longing for rhetoric about faith and values in Republican politics. In 2008, Mike Huckabee won eight states and more than 4 million primary votes before withdrawing in March. A motley crew of characters split evangelicals\u2019 allegiances in 2012. Rick Santorum, a Roman Catholic, received vital evangelical support in winning primaries in six conservative states.\n\nCruz has repeatedly defied and alienated the Republican establishment, and no candidate has ever won the nomination without significant support from party insiders.\n\nEvangelicals often prefer GOP primary candidates who end up losing the nomination to whoever the party establishment prefers. The nominee ends up being someone the party feels is a safer bet for the general election but whose religious commitment evangelicals greet with private, and sometimes public, skepticism.\n\nPundits overstate the notion that evangelicals \u201chold their noses\u201d to vote for candidates like John McCain or Mitt Romney. But it is clear that evangelical leaders harbored doubts about recent GOP nominees\u2019 personal faith and commitments to evangelicals\u2019 core issues.\n\nMcCain somewhat overcame his failure to win over evangelicals by adding Sarah Palin to the 2008 ticket. Romney\u2019s Mormon faith was an issue because a majority of evangelicals do not consider Mormons to be Christians.\n\nBut McCain\u2019s and Romney\u2019s success ironically points to the reasons for Cruz\u2019s pending failure. Political science research points to the outsized and unseen power of party insiders in presidential nominations. Less scientific but no less true is the oft-made observation that the GOP in particular defers not only to the establishment, but also to whichever candidate has \u201cpaid his dues\u201d and seems to be \u201cnext in line.\u201d\n\nCruz has repeatedly defied and alienated the Republican establishment, and no candidate has ever won the nomination without significant support from party insiders.\n\nAfter the Liberty University speech, a Cruz staffer employed a March Madness metaphor, claiming that the senator is the top seed in the Tea Party bracket and in the evangelical bracket.\n\nUnfortunately for Cruz, whichever candidate wins the establishment bracket will almost certainly win the nomination.\n\nActivating a key GOP constituency like anti-government libertarians or conservative evangelicals is only a viable strategy if it is combined with significant establishment appeal. For this reason, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and even Rand Paul are better positioned than Ted Cruz.\n\nIn previous Republican nominating contests, Cruz\u2019s outspoken evangelical faith could have been a political advantage. But white evangelicals are now so used to working with Catholics on sex-related issues that a candidate\u2019s evangelical identity hardly matters.\n\nThis cycle\u2019s GOP nominating contest features a large number of Catholic candidates. Given evangelicals\u2019 primary support for Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum at various points in the 2012 race, Catholic GOP politicians who share evangelicals\u2019 opposition to abortion and concerns about religious liberty should feel secure in their ability to attract and retain evangelicals\u2019 support.\n\nFears that Ted Cruz would be trounced in November 2016 like \u201ca Republican George McGovern\u201d are vastly overstated. But Ted Cruz\u2019s fervent evangelical faith, however sincere, does nothing to advance his credibility as a contender for the nomination.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:35.627+0000"}
{"entityId": 1775, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Was the GOP front-runner really a member of his prep school socialist club? A short study in how political memes take off.\n\nWas Jeb Bush a young socialist?\n\nNumerous profiles of the Republican front-runner\u2019s time at boarding school make reference to his brief time as a member of a campus socialist club. \u201cHe dallied with the Socialist Club at his elite boarding school, Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts,\u201d journalist S.V. D\u00e1te writes in his 2005 book Jeb: America\u2019s Next Bush. According to The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty by Peter Schweizer and his wife, Rochelle, Jeb joined the club sometime during his four years at the school, better known as Andover, which both his father and older brother had attended.\n\nThe claim is repeated in passing in a piece Alec MacGillis wrote for Slate about Jeb\u2019s relationship with his Andover classmate and future New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick. A 2012 profile of Jeb for New York magazine also refers to Jeb\u2019s membership in the socialist club during a pot-addled \u201cshort period of rebellion.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: It doesn\u2019t appear to be true.\n\nThere\u2019s no record of such a club existing during Jeb\u2019s 1967-1971 stint at the school. The Phillipian, Andover\u2019s school newspaper, never mentions a socialist club on campus, and neither does the school yearbook.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Bush\u2019s campaign says it\u2019s all bunk. He wasn\u2019t involved with any socialist club during his time at Andover, according to Jeb spokesman Tim Miller, and \u201chas no idea\u201d where the claim originated.\n\nThis is what we do know about Jeb Bush\u2019s time at Andover: For the most part, he didn\u2019t like it. He told The Boston Globe it was a \u201cdifficult time\u201d in his life. \u201cI was a cynical little turd at a cynical school,\u201d he told the Miami Herald. He did indeed grow his hair long, and has admitted to drinking and smoking pot while at the school. (\u201cI remember him smoking a lot of dope,\u201d one former classmate told Vanity Fair in 2001.)\n\nHe wasn\u2019t involved with any socialist club during his time at Andover, according to Jeb spokesman Tim Miller, and \u201chas no idea\u201d where the claim originated.\n\nJeb was an indifferent student his first few years there, but straightened out after meeting his future wife Columba during a school trip to Mexico when he was 17. By senior year he had made the dean\u2019s list and was captain of the tennis team. But he remained, according to many accounts, largely apolitical while at Andover, although he was in his own words \u201cambivalent\u201d about or \u201cprobably against\u201d the Vietnam War. According to his mother, he seriously thought about registering as a conscientious objector, a claim Jeb later disputed. Although he never volunteered to fight, he did register for the draft in 1971.\n\nRebellious? Check. Long hair? Check. Weed? Yup, and apparently a lot of it. He was, as one former classmate put it to Vanity Fair, a \u201cbudding hippie\u201d at an establishment bastion rapidly veering leftward.\n\nBut while Young Jeb had a certain Prodigal Son thing going on, there\u2019s nothing to really back up the claim that he was ever a socialist.\n\nPaige Roberts, Andover\u2019s director of Archives and Special Collections, told The Daily Beast that she had \u201cnot heard anything about a socialist club\u201d at the school at the years Jeb was there. However, she said that \u201cthere is less [information] related to student clubs and activities than I would like.\u201d\n\nSo, then, where did the story come from?\n\nMacGillis, who now writes for ProPublica, told me he got the info from Peter Schweizer\u2019s book. Schweizer, the conservative author behind the much covered Clinton Cash, wrote \u201ca solid, well-researched, workmanlike book, less friendly to the Bushes than one would expect given Schweizer\u2019s politics,\u201d according to MacGillis, despite what he describes as \u201ca few comically blatant shadings and elisions here and there.\u201d (Schweizer briefly worked as a speechwriter for George W. Bush years after The Bushes was published in 2004.)\n\n\u201cMy best guess is that the club was so short-lived or half-assed that it never showed up as an official one in the lists you\u2019re looking at.\u201d MacGillis added. \u201cI seem to recall somewhere in my research seeing a mention of the fact that Andover had a club for just about everything.\u201d\n\nJeb author D\u00e1te, who covered Bush when he was governor of Florida and now works for National Journal, also said he got the socialist club tidbit from Schweizer\u2019s book, as did Joe Hagan, who wrote the New York piece. Schweizer, meanwhile, was unable to tell The Daily Beast where he got the information, though he recalled sourcing it to a media report. In the edition of The Bushes purchased by The Daily Beast, however, the claim is not sourced at all.\n\nBut, as MacGillis noted, there were plenty of clubs at Andover, and many were sarcastic in nature. Students involved in a campus prank\u2014like, say, vandalizing the school library late at night\u2014would form a club with some innocuous name as an in-joke, a way to thumb their nose at the administrators who never caught them. Perhaps the \u201cAndover Socialist Club\u201d was something along those lines, formed and dissolved between bong-rips one weekend.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s kind of hard to imagine that an Andover Socialist Club never existed, especially during the Vietnam era. By the end of Jeb\u2019s tenure at the school, the yearbook included not just pictures of peace protests but crying Vietnamese peasants. The student body was radicalized, and a makeshift bomb was found on the campus in 1971.\n\nBut it doesn\u2019t look like that was ever Jeb\u2019s scene. He started as something of an apathetic \u201cslob,\u201d as classmate (and potential Democratic presidential candidate) Lincoln Chafee one labeled him, and left a studious, almost-handsome jock dating the woman he would one day marry.

The registry, which would be available to law enforcement, would include the names, stage names, birthdays, addresses, places of employment, phone numbers, and other personal details of strippers working in Pennsylvania.

{"entityId": 1778, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The abortion debate has long been nuanced and highly emotional, which is why it deserves better than the current bickering between Senator Rand Paul and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz.\n\nMost Americans believe that abortion should be legal but vary in their support for the legality of the procedure during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy. It\u2019s a broad consensus that still leaves room for heated debate over state-level restrictions.\n\nBut if you\u2019ve been listening to the spitting match this past week between Rand Paul and DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), the abortion debate is about accusing each other of murder on cable television.\n\nPaul has suggested that Wasserman Schultz and the DNC endorse the \u201ckilling\u201d of babies and Wasserman Schultz has, in turn, insinuated that Paul would be willing to \u201clet a woman die\u201d if her life were endangered by pregnancy.\n\nLives are indeed at stake in the abortion debate but turning a complex conversation into a childish game of ideological chicken doesn\u2019t help either party\u2019s position.\n\nIn 2015, the abortion debate deserves better than this.\n\nIt all started last Wednesday in New Hampshire when a CNN reporter asked Senator Paul to clarify his stance on exemptions to abortion restrictions.\n\n\u201cYou go back and you ask Debbie Wasserman Schultz if she\u2019s OK with killing a seven-pound baby that is just not yet born yet,\u201d Paul responded.\n\nIn this first rhetorical salvo, Paul paints his perspective as a departure from a seemingly deadlocked debate over the start of life.\n\n\u201cWe always seem to have the debate way over here,\u201d he said, gesturing to one side, before making his dubious baby-killer accusation.\n\nIn reality, however, Paul is trotting out the same tired GOP talking points about late-term abortions that make the abortion debate seem more two-sided than it actually is. According to data from the Guttmacher Institute, only about 1 percent of abortions in the United States occur after 21 weeks of pregnancy. Nearly 90 percent take place within the first 12 weeks. These numbers fall in line with earlier CDC data, which show that 88 percent of abortions take place before the 13-week mark in pregnancy.\n\nPaul has suggested that Wasserman Schultz and the DNC endorse the \u201ckilling\u201d of babies and Wasserman Schultz has, in turn, insinuated that Paul would be willing to \u201clet a woman die\u201d if her life were endangered by pregnancy.\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why the abortion debate in its most partisan form tends to hinge on the start of life, or \u201cway over here,\u201d as Paul put it: Very few late-term abortions actually take place.\n\nBy turning late-term abortions into a metonym for the issue as a whole, Paul is clearly attempting to challenge the American consensus on the legality of abortion earlier in pregnancy. It\u2019s a tactic as old as Roe: make first-trimester abortions guilty by association with the more easily demonized late-term procedures.\n\nBut instead of crucifying the disingenuousness of Paul\u2019s question about killing \u201ca seven-pound baby,\u201d Wasserman Schultz fired back with an unequivocal statement that left him too much room to paint the Democratic Party\u2019s support for abortion rights as a wholesale endorsement of late-term abortion.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s an answer,\u201d wrote Wasserman Schultz that same day. \u201cI support letting women and their doctors make this decision without government getting involved. Period. End of story.\u201d\n\nHer statement concluded with a reference to Paul\u2019s infamous shushing of a CNBC anchor: \u201cAnd I\u2019d appreciate it if you could respond without \u2018shushing me.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn what was quickly becoming more of a playground spat than a substantive argument, Paul went on The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer to skewer Wasserman Schultz\u2019s response, which was almost as nonspecific as his own position.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a bit of doubt and discussion earlier in pregnancy but Debbie\u2019s position\u2014which I guess is the Democrat party position\u2014that an abortion all the way up until the day of birth would be fine?\u201d Paul said. \u201cI think most pro-choice people would be a little uncomfortable with that.\u201d\n\nHe reiterated, too, that Wasserman Schultz must be \u201cOK with killing a seven-pound baby.\u201d\n\nAccording to Gallup data, Paul is correct that many people who identify as pro-choice do not support abortion in the third trimester. But beyond that point, his comments leave more than enough room for ridicule. His consistent focus on the weight of fetuses rather than their viability outside the uterus is both bizarre and unscientific. And his refusal, when prompted by Blitzer, to state whether or not he believes there should be exceptions to anti-abortion legislation is political obfuscation at its most transparent.\n\nAbove all, Paul is running for president and Wasserman Schultz is not. Refusing to clarify his own platform before the DNC chairman responds to half-accusations of murder is a move that should be thrown out, tout court.\n\nBut not only has Wasserman Schultz continued to engage Paul on his terms, she is starting to match the murder rhetoric with some of her own.\n\nIn a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer on Monday, Wasserman Schultz called out Paul\u2019s deflection and emphasized that she\u2019s not running for president but, unfortunately, she didn\u2019t let her rejoinder rest there.\n\n\u201cAre we going to let a woman die?\u201d she asked. \u201cWould Rand Paul let a woman die because she\u2019s carrying a baby or is he going to let her make that choice with her doctor?\u201d\n\nAs a matter of public health, stringent abortion restrictions do play a factor in the annual death of tens of thousands of women worldwide. In the U.S., however, the incidence of unsafe abortion is negligible and the rate of pregnancy-related deaths is increasing but still low. The CDC estimates that 17.8 pregnancy-related deaths occurred for every 100,000 live births in 2011, the latest year for which there is data.\n\nFor Wasserman Schultz to divert an already long-derailed discussion of late-term abortions into the concept of life endangerment is even more misleading because most women who seek these procedures do not do so for reasons of life endangerment.\n\nAs the authors of a 2013 study in Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health write, \u201c[D]ata suggest that most women seeking later terminations are not doing so for reasons of fetal anomaly or life endangerment.\u201d\n\nThis same study does reveal plenty of salient and politically urgent reasons to support \u201clater abortion,\u201d which the authors define as taking place after 20 weeks gestational age. Two-thirds of the women in the sample reported delays because they had to raise money for travel to a clinic and often for the procedure itself. Women seeking late-term abortions are also significantly more likely to have experienced difficulties securing insurance coverage than women who receive abortions during the first trimester.\n\nBy making it more difficult for women to receive abortions in the first trimester, the GOP indirectly but effectively forces them to wait until it may no longer be legal to do so\u201442 states prohibit abortions based on fetal viability or after a certain gestational age. Health exceptions remain an important battleground in the U.S. abortion debate but they are not as central to the issue as the basic barriers to access that many women face.\n\nFrom this perspective, Wasserman Schultz\u2019s \u201cWould Rand Paul Let A Woman Die?\u201d grandstanding marks a missed opportunity to highlight the massive wave of abortion restrictions hitting state legislatures in 2015.\n\nBut talking about the nitty-gritty of legislation doesn\u2019t score as many points as calling Paul a potential murderer when he\u2019s essentially called you the same. Paul\u2019s position on abortion is not a difficult one to defuse but Wasserman Schultz has bungled her opportunities to do so, opting to bite back instead of leaving him to flounder.\n\nIn a Fox News interview with Megyn Kelly on Tuesday, Wasserman Schultz continued to dodge Paul\u2019s own deflection of the original question by deflecting Kelly\u2019s questions to her back to him. With any luck\u2014and with Hillary Clinton officially in the race\u2014their back-and-forth will quickly fizzle out form here.\n\nLate-term abortions and life endangerment are not the center of the abortion debate, but as long as Paul and Wasserman Schultz keep talking, they\u2019ll continue to be painted as such.

There has to be a reason, and that, to me, is my reason.\u201d\n\nIt has been more than 131 days since Lynch was nominated to be attorney general. If confirmed, she would be the first female African American to serve in that role.\n\nThe holdup has been unprecedented: As of Monday, Lynch\u2019s nomination will have been left unaddressed by the full Senate for 25 days\u2014longer than the last seven attorneys general had to wait, combined.\n\n\u201cThe harm of bringing race into this is that you\u2019re invoking race when it is not the dominant issue,\u201d Roland Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous\u2026 you gave them a dish on a silver platter from a Democrat in the leadership!\u201d\n\nIn all the time that Lynch\u2019s nomination has been pending, there has been no evidence that Republicans were motivated by anything other than politics.\n\nUnsubstantiated claims of racism is a strategy that could backfire, argued Roland Martin, an African-American journalist and television personality who occasionally contributes to The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThe conversation now is not about Loretta Lynch and the delay, it\u2019s about Dick Durbin invoking race. Now he\u2019s the center of the story, instead of the ridiculous delays for Loretta Lynch,\u201d he said.\n\nNumber two Senate Democrat Dick Durbin said Wednesday that Lynch was being \u201casked to sit in the back of the bus when it comes to the Senate calendar.\u201d\n\nGOP Senator John McCain took Durbin to task for the remark on Thursday, arguing that to \u201cuse that imagery and suggest that racist tactics are being employed\u2026 has no place in this body and serves no purpose other than to further divide us.\u201d\n\nBy invoking race unnecessarily, it gives credibility to those who don\u2019t want to ever talk about race, argued Martin.\n\n\u201cThe harm of bringing race into this is that you\u2019re invoking race when it is not the dominant issue,\u201d Martin said, referring to Durbin\u2019s remarks. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous\u2026 you gave them a dish on a silver platter from a Democrat in the leadership!\u201d\n\nRangel himself appeared somewhat divided on whether to bring up race in a Thursday afternoon press conference.\n\n\u201cFor some Americans, racism is an awkward subject to talk about. But we cannot eliminate or [bring] this problem to light unless we admit we have it\u2026 to run away from it is wrong,\u201d the New York Democrat said.\n\nBut then, Rangel held back on elaborating: \u201cQuite frankly, I don\u2019t want to answer any more questions because the whole world is watching, and I doubt whether anybody is making any different reasons for [Lynch\u2019s confirmation delay].\u201d\n\nDemocrats have long felt President Barack Obama has gotten unprecedentedly poor treatment from Republicans, at least in part because he is the first African-American president. The disrespect of GOP Rep. Joe Wilson\u2019s \u201cYou Lie!\u201d still lingers in their mind.\n\nAnd Lynch herself has had her dealings with racism: After receiving the highest grades in her high school class, she was forced to share the the role of valedictorian with white students due to administrators who feared a backlash over a lone African American holding that honor.\n\nBut the ultimate takeaway, Martin argued, is that Lynch\u2019s confirmation is about politics\u2014not race.\n\n\u201cDick Durbin, if he needs to blame anybody, he needs to start with himself and Sen. Harry Reid. They should have gotten votes to confirm before Republicans took control of the Senate [in January],\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt is shameful to watch the U.S. Senate, how they behave, don\u2019t get work done\u2014and they want to sit there and grandstand.\u201d\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008, is both enthusiastically supportive of Lynch's nomination and strenuous in pushing back against the idea that his fellow Republicans were opposing Lynch on the basis of race or gender.\n\n\n\n\u201cLoretta Lynch could be Lawrence Lynch and she\u2019d be just as qualified... it would be significant to have the first African American woman attorney general, I think that would be a milestone, but I think in many ways that's irrelevant to her qualifications\u201d Giuliani said Friday. \u201cI am a conservative on most legal matters\u2026 and I would probably selected her as attorney general had I been elected president way back when I failed when I ran.\u201d\n\n\n\nGiuliani said he had been working with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham to urge Republicans to support Lynch, as well as to bring her nomination up for a vote. The former mayor said that Lynch was \u201cmore than qualified\u2014she's overqualified.\u201d\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:36.361+0000"}

Earlier this month, it was revealed that in a 2005 lawsuit, Cosby admitted to buying Quaaludes to give to women he wanted to have sex with, and that he gave the drug to at least one woman.\n\nAnd as the evidence mounts, so do the calls for stripping Cosby of his Medal of Freedom. Earlier this month, the nonprofit group Promoting Awareness, Victim Empowerment (PAVE) started a petition on the White House\u2019s \u201cWe the People\u201d website calling on the Obama administration to rescind the honor. \u201cWe urge the administration to take the unprecedented action of revoking this award,\u201d the petition reads.\n\n\u201cHad you known then what you know now, I am certain you never would have allowed Mr. Cosby to receive this singular distinction.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest was later asked about the matter at a press briefing, and Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Claire McCaskill have expressed their support for revoking Cosby\u2019s medal.\n\nNow, PAVE is trying to enlist the support of the man who personally presented the award to Cosby.\n\n\u201cMr. President, when you presented Mr. Cosby with the nation\u2019s highest honor you had absolutely no knowledge that he would later be accused of the sexual assault of dozens of women,\u201d Angela Rose, PAVE\u2019s executive director, said in a letter to former President Bush. \u201cHad you known then what you know now, I am certain you never would have allowed Mr. Cosby to receive this singular distinction\u2026Mr. President, it is not too late to remedy this. I urge you to express your support with my organization\u2019s ongoing effort to revoke the medal from Mr. Cosby.\u201d\n\nYou can read the letter in its entirely below:\n\nRose says that prior to emailing the letter to the George W.

And prosecutor Francis Schmitz has indicated he may try to appeal the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nProgressives say the justices should have recused themselves, because they benefited from issue-advocacy ads.\n\n\u201cThe four justices whose opinion halts an investigation and possible prosecution of Walker\u2019s campaign and allies and orders records to be destroyed were the beneficiaries of at least $10 million in campaign spending by parties named in the investigation,\u201d said a statement from progressive group One Wisconsin Now issued after the decision.\n\nAs you might expect, conservatives strongly back the state\u2019s top court\u2014and are univocal in their support of the conservative justices who moved to call off the secret investigation.

His group filed an amicus brief for the side that ultimately won.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it can be the case that the mere fact that somebody has spent money on issue advocacy means that you can never hear a case in which they\u2019re involved,\u201d he said.\n\nThe John Doe investigators targeted a number of members from throughout Wisconsin conservatives\u2019 infrastructure in the state\u2014an infrastructure whose operations that has been remarkably efficient and effective.\n\n\u201cThey issued subpoenas or search warrants to virtually every conservative or libertarian 501(c)4 advocacy organization in the state,\u201d he continued. \u201cSo they were all involved, in a way, almost every one of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the guy who kills his parents and then pleads for clemency because he\u2019s an orphan,\u201d Rick Esenberg, the president of the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, said.\n\n\n\nTo assert that investigating conservative advocacy organizations means conservative justices can\u2019t rule on the case, Esenberg argues, is unfair.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like the guy who kills his parents and then pleads for clemency because he\u2019s an orphan,\u201d Esenberg said. \u201cThey don\u2019t get to remove one side of the political spectrum from the bench because they\u2019ve attacked the entire advocacy structure on that side of the political spectrum.\u201d\n\nAnd investigators\u2019 use of SWAT teams and no-knock raids drew criticism from both ends of the ideological spectrum. Salon\u2019s Heather Digby Parton called the no-knock raids \u201cdisturbing.\u201d\n\nMatt Kittle, the editor-in-chief of the conservative news site Wisconsin Watchdog, characterized the investigation as Nixonian.\n\n\u201cThis was, based on our investigation over the last few years, one of the more abusive probes in our lifetimes in the state of Wisconsin, and I think it goes up against any nationally,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was politically motivated, the court made that clear today.\u201d\n\nBut Wisconsin progressives argue that that all misses the point.\n\nState Senator Chris Larson said the ruling is \u201cthe definition of corruption.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you asked the average person on the street, \u2018Draw me a picture of what a corrupt system looks like,\u2019 this would be too obvious to them,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is it.

Instead, the Texan\u2019s strategy will be passive aggressive: Cruz will praise his opponents on the issues they have common ground on, while the real criticism will be left unspoken and implied.\n\nBehind the scenes, the personal relationships between Cruz\u2019s and Paul\u2019s offices have deteriorated as the presidential campaigns draw nearer.\n\nThe setting of his announcement Monday morning, Liberty University, the largest evangelical Christian university in the world, is also telling.\n\nWhile Cruz is willing to cede hardcore libertarians to Paul (some of whom are starting to become disenchanted with the Kentucky senator), he\u2019ll be targeting the conservatives with libertarian instincts who identify positively with the Tea Party movement.\n\nHowever, the president of Liberty University, Jerry Falwell Jr., has had nice things to say about Paul in the past: In 2013, Falwell said of Paul, \u201cespecially after meeting him this morning, the more I thought to myself, \u2018I sure hope he runs for president.\u2019\u201d\n\nCruz and Paul have always had a sort of frienemies relationship in the Senate.\n\nWhen Paul held a drone filibuster in 2013, Cruz came to the Senate floor to show support. And Paul supported Cruz when the Texas senator filibustered on Obamacare later that year.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, the personal relationships between Cruz\u2019s and Paul\u2019s offices have deteriorated as the presidential campaigns draw nearer. In Cruzworld, there is a belief that Paul\u2019s staff has a sense of entitlement, that they feel that their senator was the insurgent candidate first.\n\nIt\u2019s just not Cruz\u2019s style to take on Paul directly\u2014and it would be a bit hypocritical to start now. The Texas senator is fond of asking reporters whether they\u2019ve ever heard him launch an unkind, personal attack on a fellow Republican (unless that Republican is named \u201cJohn McCain\u201d or \u201cMitt Romney\u201d).\n\nOn midterm election night in Austin, Cruz told The Daily Beast, \u201cAn awful lot of folks in the media like to focus on internal politics in Washington, on the jockeying of one politician versus another. In my view, most Americans could not care less about politicians in Washington bickering.\u201d\n\nOne example of how that fight plays out is the differing opinions Paul and Cruz had on NSA reform. Cruz was a co-sponsor of a NSA surveillance reform bill that made incremental reforms to the surveillance agency, while Paul played a role in sinking the bill in November, arguing that it didn\u2019t go far enough.\n\nThe maneuver put Cruz between Republican hawks, who want the NSA to maintain its existing surveillance capabilities, and Paul, who was insistent that more could be done to curtail the agency\u2014even at the risk of getting no reforms at all.\n\nAnd that\u2019s exactly where Cruz wants to be.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:38.205+0000"}

Hundreds of people queued up in a line that snaked around the block at Washington\u2019s Politics & Prose bookstore last week. A sudden downpour sent some scurrying into storefronts along the way, but the line moved quickly as the former president affixed his \u201cJ Carter\u201d on book after book with assembly line efficiency.\n\nCarter didn\u2019t leave office a rich man. His peanut warehouse in Plains, Georgia, which was held in a blind trust during his presidency, had fallen into disrepair. Writing books is how Carter makes his living, and 35 years after leaving office, he\u2019s promoting his 29th book, A Full Life: Reflections at Ninety, a look back at his rural beginnings, his improbable road to the White House, and his even more improbable post-presidency.\n\nFor a group of adoring fans, Carter is something of a cult hero now, his post-presidency wildly more successful than his single term in the White House. And that\u2019s no accident, says Les Francis, a former Carter White House staffer.\n\n\u201cI believe that once he got over the 1980 election, Carter decided that to repair his reputation and his standing was going to take exactly the same determination and relentless drive it took for him to win the White House,\u201d he says.\n\nWhere Carter\u2019s comeback from crushing defeat and near financial ruin took years to overcome, President Obama will leave the White House in January 2017 with a huge advantage that neither of his Democratic predecessors had. An historic figure and a proven writer, Obama can write a memoir that will command a hefty advance, as will Michelle Obama\u2019s, which means the couple will be pretty well set financially and freer much sooner to raise money for their post-presidential programs and causes than either Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton were when they re-entered private life at the same age, in their mid-fifties.\n\nObama, who will be 55 when he leaves the White House, won\u2019t have to write 30 books like Carter, and he won\u2019t have to hit the speech circuit with the same zeal as Clinton, who, at 54 in 2001, had never made serious money. Though Hillary Clinton\u2019s lament that her family was \u201cflat broke\u201d upon leaving the White House was an offensive exaggeration considering the couple\u2019s earning potential, the Clintons did have millions in legal fees they had to pay down before building their now very handsome nest egg.\n\nWhere Carter\u2019s comebackfrom crushing defeat and near financial ruintook years to overcome, President Obama will leave the White House in January 2017 with a huge advantage that neither of his Democratic predecessors had.\n\n\n\nObama\u2019s popularity has not reached 50 percent for some time. How he is regarded after he leaves the White House depends a lot on the next president. If a Democrat is elected, it will be seen as an affirmation of the Obama presidency. If a Republican wins the White House, it could be seen as a repudiation of Obama and a presidency that veered off course and fell short of expectations.\n\nWith either outcome, Obama will have a lot of unfinished business, and to the extent that he can burnish his presidency through acts of public service, the prototype is the Carter Center. Originally modeled after Camp David as a place where warring factions could come together to mediate conflicts, the Carter Center in Atlanta is a major player in international peacekeeping, election monitoring, and global health issues.\n\nEstablished by Carter after he lost to Ronald Reagan in a landslide in 1980, it is the vehicle through which Carter transformed his image. And it is the prototype upon which the Clinton Foundation and the George W. Bush Library continue the signature efforts of the presidents that bear their name. The success of Carter\u2019s post-presidency boosts his presidency as well, says Francis, who believes, \u201cPeople will ultimately view the Carter presidency in part through the prism of his post-presidency.\u201d\n\nMost Americans, if asked what Carter has done with his life since leaving the White House, might know that he teaches Sunday school, he builds houses through Habitat for Humanity, and he works for international peace and health. These activities are who he is, and it is this authenticity that explains his popularity in the autumn of his life.\n\nThe parallels for Obama would be teaching law and/or public policy at the University of Chicago, or Columbia University, his alma mater; devoting his time and standing to the initiative he launched in the White House, My Brother\u2019s Keeper, extending his reach as the first black president in ways that perhaps were not fully available to him in the White House; and helping define America\u2019s role in an ever-changing world while bridging the divides at home, which he largely failed to do as president.\n\nObama says he expects to live long enough to be accountable for the outcome of the historic nuclear arms control deal with Iran. He will have to be more of a team if a Democrat succeeds him in the White House. Carter was followed by 12 years of Republican rule, and Democratic presidents were wary of him as well. He has the history of being a lone ranger and not caring what others think of what he says or does, qualities that today\u2019s voters admire and that together with his sheer longevity have made him a politician who overcame his presidency\u2019s shoddy legacy.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:38.351+0000"}

But instead of an enthusiastic yes, or a politician\u2019s non-answer, Biden spoke with the raw honesty of a still-grieving father.\n\n\u201cThe most relevant fact is whether my family and I have the emotional energy to run,\u201d Biden said, adding that he has no set timeline for himself to make a decision.\n\nBiden\u2019s eldest son, Beau Biden, died of cancer in May.

Can my family?\u2019 The honest-to-God answer is, I just don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nAfter a pause, he turned to his friend and host, former ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, and said, \u201cBut I have to be honest with you and everyone who\u2019s come to me.

He touched on China\u2019s \u201ctesting and crossing the limits of international law and acceptable behavior.\u201d He spoke of the so-called Islamic State widely known as ISIS and the patience it will require from the American people to destroy it.

Bush paid in taxes?\n\nThen this might be the most glorious night of your life. Late this afternoon\u2014and a few minutes ahead of schedule\u2014Jeb Bush released a cache of tax returns , starting in 1981.\n\nBush\u2019s income skyrocketed after he finished his time as Florida governor in 2007. In his last year as governor, 2006, he made $261,000 . According to his newly released tax returns (2013 is the most recent year his campaign provided), the governor has made at least $29 million since leaving office and becoming a private citizen. Not too shabby.\n\nA significant chunk of the former governor\u2019s income came from high-paid consulting gigs with Lehman Brothers\u2014of 2008 recession infamy\u2014and Barclays, a multinational bank based in Britain. Bush\u2019s campaign told Bloomberg that he made $2 million a year through 2014 from his arrangement with Barclays. Bloomberg also noted that between 2007 and 2013, he made $8.1 million from giving paid speeches.\n\nBush can expect criticism for the percentage of his income that he gave to charities. Mother Jones published a story a few hours after his tax returns went online saying the governor \u201cgave little\u201d to charity\u20141.5 percent of his income between 2003 and 2013. The site noted that the national average is 3 percent and that the Obamas gave charities 15 percent of their income last year. Bush\u2019s talent as a fundraiser has had an outsize impact on his favorite charities; his site notes that he\u2019s held annual events that have raised $7.4 million toward curing cystic fibrosis. The campaign said he also raised $17 million as honorary volunteer chair for his mom\u2019s Barbara Bush Foundation Celebration of Reading.\n\nIn a post on his website , Bush touted his commitment to transparency, and\u2014naturally\u2014he didn\u2019t miss a chance to needle Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income,\u201d he wrote.\n\nA nifty graph asserts that his average tax rate over the three decades was 34 percent, compared to Clinton\u2019s 30 percent tax rate in 2014.\n\n\u201cOne fun fact I learned in this process: I have paid a higher tax rate than the Clintons even though I earned less income,\u201d Jeb Bush wrote.\n\nFor those keeping score, that\u2019s 33 years versus one year.\n\nBut anyway, on to the transparency.\n\n\u201cToday, I\u2019m releasing 33 years of tax returns\u2014more than any presidential candidate in history,\u201d he wrote, the text resting over a colorful graph comparing his disclosure to presidential candidates of the past.\n\nIn 1988, for instance, Michael Dukakis only released returns from 5 years. For shame.\n\nBush framed his tax-return-dumping as a gesture of openness and goodwill.\n\n\u201cYou might remember a few months back, in the spirit of transparency, I posted 280,000 emails from my time as governor on JebEmails.com,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSome of them were funny, some serious, some a little embarrassing. But I put them all out because I wanted people to have a window into my leadership style and be able to see for themselves how I handled the issues facing our state.\u201d\n\nNevermind that under Florida\u2019s Sunshine Law those emails were already public record.\n\nAnyway, Bush\u2019s release of 1,150 pages of tax returns is explicitly designed to burnish his transparency credentials.\n\nAnd it\u2019s also given him a chance to ding the U.S. tax code.\n\n\u201cI just came back from Estonia where it takes residents less than five minutes to file their taxes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe tax release process sure would\u2019ve been a lot easier if we were following the Estonia model.\u201d\n\nBush also used the moment to tout his business experience.\n\nAnother graph shows that his business grew from 3 to 250 employees, and depicts that change in a chart, in case you have trouble getting your mind around the difference between those two figures.\n\nBush gave a very cursory description of the work he did between his governorship gig and presidential bid.\n\nHe mentioned, for instance, that he worked as a senior adviser to Barclays. But he didn\u2019t mention that before taking that gig, he became an adviser to Lehman Brothers, as Bloomberg noted last December.\n\nOmitting Lehman\u2019s from his e-r\u00e9sum\u00e9 makes sense, given its connection to the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nA few hours after Bush\u2019s tax returns come out, the State Department will release a trove of emails Clinton sent while serving as secretary of state.

Scott Peters (D-Calif.), ending a nasty campaign for California\u2019s 52nd congressional district representing San Diego. It was a campaign filled with accusations from a former aide of alleged sexual misconduct\u2014charges that hobbled his campaign in its final weeks.\n\nLast week, Todd Bosnich, the former aide, admitted to manufacturing emails he used to support his claim that DeMaio sexually harassed him, and plead guilty to obstruction of justice.\n\nThe admission was a cold comfort to DeMaio.\n\n\u201cThe impact this has had on my family, it was very rough,\u201d DeMaio told The Daily Beast in an interview. \u201cBut I\u2019m very please to see at least some level of justice delivered with these charges.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t go back and have a do-over on an election,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s just not how the system works and I get that. \u201c\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t still angry.\n\nHe\u2019s angry about how his opponent used tactics he describes as a cynical ploy to scare away conservative voters by making them uncomfortable with the fact DeMaio is gay.\n\n\u201cIt absolutely was generated to go after our conservatives voters,\u201d DeMaio said. \u201cWhat [Peters] needed to do was not go to the middle, he needed to try to dissuade far right voters, older voters, social conservative voters, from voting for the gay guy.\u201d\n\nDeMaio said conservative voters were willing to overlook the fact he was gay, if there wasn\u2019t an \u201cick factor,\u201d which is why, he said, one was created.\n\n\u201cYou can be gay, but you can\u2019t be one of those gays,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why this allegation was so vicious, so disgusting and so harmful. Because Mr. Peters played on the notion of \u2018Oh, he\u2019s a sexual deviant.\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s why this was frustrating.\u201d\n\nPeters, in an interview, denied having anything to do with the allegations and said DeMaio was still refusing to take responsibility for his actions.\n\n\u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is entirely untrue,\u201d Peters told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe authorities did not make any opinion on whether Mr. Bosnich\u2019s sexual harassment [allegations] were true or false.\u201d\n\n(No sexual harassment charges were ever filed against DeMaio.)\n\nHe added that a second claim, unrelated to the alleged incident with Bosnich, (\u201cI\u2019m sure Carl didn\u2019t mention\u201d) was made by another campaign staffer.\n\n\u201cWe did not make any allegations against Carl DeMaio,\u201d Peters said. \u201cThose allegations came from two former Republican staffers. To blame it on me is something Carl is trying to do to avoid answering some of those questions himself. And, again, the police did not say that those allegations were false. \u201c\n\nBut before we go further into the back-and-forth let\u2019s back up for a minute.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of being a gay Republican, not supported by the gay community, they don\u2019t like the fact that you are Republican. That\u2019s the ultimate betrayal, is being a Republican.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, DeMaio was one of three openly gay Republicans who ran in competitive congressional districts. DeMaio-Peters was one of the tightest in the country\u2014with both candidates polling within the margin of error for months.\n\n\u201cI wanted to say that this needed to be a mandate from a purple district that you need people who are willing to stand up in Congress and say, \u2018Cut the crap on the social issues and let\u2019s just make government work,\u201d DeMaio told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe trouble began in May when DeMaio\u2019s office was broken into and vandalized\u2014campaign materials disappeared only to reappear in the hands of the Peter\u2019s campaign later.\n\nThe Peters campaign has maintained they turned the materials over to the police\u2014but how fast they did it is still a matter of disagreement between the warring factions.\n\nIn October, a campaign aide, Todd Bosnich, who had been fired earlier that year for plagiarism, surfaced with allegations that DeMaio had sexually harassed him and then tried to buy his silence for $50,000 after he was fired.\n\nBosnich said he received threatening emails after he reported the sexual harassment. The FBI soon began to investigate his claims. They later said no charges would be filed against DeMaio.\n\nWith just days left to go, a second former DeMaio campaign staffer accused DeMaio of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment.\n\nThe DeMaio campaign said it was another smear designed to help Peters out in the waning days of the campaign.\n\nOn Election Day, DeMaio lost by about 3 percent.\n\nSeveral days after the election the San Diego Union-Tribune, citing court documents, reported Peters\u2019 campaign manager, MaryAnne Pintar, was the one who initially reported Bosnich\u2019s claims to the police.\n\nIn fact, Pintar met with Bosnich in June and was given DeMaio campaign documents including strategy documents. She made copies of some of the documents and then turned them over to the police days later, according to the Union-Tribune report.\n\n\u201cA young man I had never met before reached out to me saying he\u2019d been sexually assaulted and threatened by Carl DeMaio,\u201d she told the Union-Tribune at the time. \u201cI was concerned about his welfare and went to the police, who thanked me and asked for my continued cooperation, which I provided.\u201d\n\nThe second staffer who accused DeMaio had also had interactions with Pintar.\n\nLast week, Assistant U.S. Attorney Phil Halpern told the Los Angeles Times that Bosnich, \u201chad the potential to affect a national election\u201d and \u201cfor whatever reason, had a great deal of hostility and personal animus toward Mr. DeMaio.\u201d\n\nBosnich admitted in his guilty plea he sent the threatening emails to himself through other accounts and then took them to the Peters campaign.\n\n(Frank Vecchione, Bosnich\u2019s attorney, told the Los Angeles Times that his client \u201cis accepting responsibility and wants to move on with his life.\u201d)\n\nAsked about the new revelations, Pintar emailed a statement from the Peters campaign, \u201cSomeone came to us alleging sexual harassment by Mr. DeMaio; we took everything to the police and they thanked us for it. Carl was accused by two people from his own operation. He\u2019s the one who needs to take some responsibility.\u201d\n\nPeters added, DeMaio had been accused of masturbating in a public restroom several years ago by a colleague in the city council.\n\nIn 2013, California State Sen. Ben Hueso said he walked in on DeMaio, according to the San Diego Union-Tribune. DeMaio flatly denied the allegation, as did another colleague who Hueso said witnessed a similar incident.\n\nDeMaio called Peters reaction \u201clow.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the federal justice system has unmask Bosnich as a liar, has unmasked this as a framing of a congressional candidate,\u201d DeMaio said. \u201cInstead of having an empathetic human reaction, Scott Peters continued to perpetuate a smear. That\u2019s really low, ok dude? You won the election.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI can understand why good people do not go into politics.\u201d\n\nDeMaio, who hosts a radio show on KOGO-AM in San Diego, has no plans to challenge Peters again, saying the toll this scandal took on his partner and his reputation was just too painful to relive.\n\n\u201cIt may be that it is more effective, and more palatable for me, to effect change from the outside,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the stigma of being an openly gay Republican still remains, but it\u2019s a glass ceiling for someone else to crack.\n\n\u201cThe challenge of being a gay Republican, not supported by the gay community, they don\u2019t like the fact that you are Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the ultimate betrayal, is being a Republican.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were a gay Democrat and a Republican tried doing what Scott Peters did to me, there would be rioting in the streets in the middle of the election,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s ok to do it to a Republican because, you know, we really don\u2019t want you to break through that glass ceiling.

It speaks to a belief in the mythical framework that supports not just House of Cards but most supposedly reality-based punditry, as well: an ingrained assumption that politicians are not just rational actors but inhumanly rational ones, creatures of pure logic and naked ambition whose motives can only be understood within the context of a power grab or financial gain.\n\nThese D.C. comic book schemers make every decision with an eye on the long ball. They have no personal/interior life apart from craven careerism; every interaction, every dalliance, every tweet is part of the Master Plan. All scandals, in this logic, are about checkmate in three-dimensional chess rather than a careless error in tic-tac-toe.\n\nMost politicians live through scandals to the degree that they can convince voters that their mistakes were not a part of House of Cards-scale schemes. It\u2019s the job of opposition media to look for genuine corruption or malice; allies, on the other hand, insist on bewildered shrugs or populist appeals to universal fallibility.\n\nBill Clinton knew the value of not looking like he was playing three-dimensional chess. Hillary\u2019s problem is that she never wants to look like she\u2019s playing tic-tac-toe.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing: Her appeal is based in part on an assumption of supreme competence on her part: It makes sense of both her Tracy Flick-ish arrogance and her capacity for self-preservation. It\u2019s why people think she would make a good president but also why they believe she would make an explicit \u201cdeal\u201d with Bill to stay married\u2014a thing that happens on soap operas but is emotionally impossible unless you\u2019re a real psychopath. People think of Clinton conspiracy theorists and Clinton loyalists as being in opposite camps when to this extent they are really flip sides of the same steely, calculating coin.\n\nHer protestations that her private email was the same kind of quotidian detritus you and I might send\u2014social plans, white/gold dress jokes, and Paleo brownie recipes\u2014ring hollow because of the ruthless and/or dedicated (depending on your party ID) demeanor she works hard to maintain.\n\nWe can\u2019t quite believe Hillary has a private life in the way you and I do. Because she doesn\u2019t want us to think she does.\n\nBill Clinton knew the value of not looking like he was playing three-dimensional chess. Hillary\u2019s problem is that she never wants to look like she\u2019s playing tic-tac-toe.\n\nTake her weirdly sterile accounting of what passes for apparently significant chunks of 30,000 \u201cprivate, personal\u201d emails: \u201cE-mails about planning Chelsea\u2019s wedding or my mother\u2019s funeral arrangements, condolence notes to friends as well as yoga routines, family vacations, the other things you typically find in inboxes.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve been through both a wedding and a funeral recently enough that those details alone could generate a few thousand notes\u2019 worth of an e-trail. Vacations? Also logistically complex! But how many condolences could she possibly have sent? And \u201cyoga routines\u201d? Perhaps that was tacked on to humanize her\u2014yoga is very popular!\u2014but instead it throws up a mental roadblock, because WTF, emailing \u201cyoga routines\u201d?\n\nHillary Clinton does yoga? Hillary Clinton does enough yoga that emails about it make up a memorable portion of 30,000 emails? Instead of coming across as normal, something Joe and Jane Kitchen Table can identify with, it reads as a blurry focus-group memory, perhaps something an aide added to the mix in the scramble to put a statement together. \u201cWe need something besides \u2018condolences\u2019! Something that says, \u2018I also do things not related to death!\u2019\u201d\n\nIt is much easier to imagine, for all the wrong reasons, Bill Clinton sending around multiple emails about \u201cyoga routines.\u201d That Bill doesn\u2019t actually use email is, on the whole, probably something the Hillary not-campaign should be thankful for\u2014even if it does raise even more questions about the content of her non-wedding, non-funeral, non-travel, non-yoga correspondence.\n\nPersonally, I take her at her word that she probably carried only one device, and used only one email, because it was easier. But it couldn\u2019t have escaped anyone in her circle\u2019s attention that such a setup also would make sifting out \u201cpersonal\u201d material from the dragnet of mandated recordkeeping easier.\n\nNonetheless, I can\u2019t quite push it to the third dimension of chess because any really masterful, intentional plan for diverting super-secret, incriminating emails would a) have enlisted more competent security advisers (or a security adviser, period); and b) not hinged on using the domain \u201cclintonemail.com,\u201d which seems like an improbably stupid place to keep super-secret, incriminating email. (Was her password \u201cpassword,\u201d too?)\n\nYet I suspect that the reason this scandal won\u2019t hurt her is that I\u2019m in the minority. She\u2019s the rare politician to benefit from the assumption of Underwoodian skills. She\u2019ll survive it not because people believe she made a human mistake but because they think she\u2019s not quite human, not quite real. She\u2019s all but fictional. The alternative is that she\u2019s capable of the same dumb mistakes as the rest of us, and that\u2019s as hard for her to admit as it is for us to believe.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:39.547+0000"}
{"entityId": 1791, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Republicans are insisting on tacking anti-abortion language onto an anti-sex-trafficking bill\u2014and it\u2019s just their latest effort to exploit the issue to fight \u201csexual immorality.\u201d\n\nWho doesn\u2019t hate sex trafficking?\n\nNo one, of course. Sex trafficking is horrifying. Which is why it\u2019s being exploited by social conservatives to push an anti-sex agenda under an anti-trafficking banner.\n\nJust recently, this longstanding tactic became front-page news. A pending Senate bill on sex trafficking was all set to pass\u2014until Democrats discovered that it expands a longstanding policy known as the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer money from being used to fund abortions. Under the proposed law, that policy would now also cover a dedicated fund for victims of sex trafficking.\n\nSneakily, the bill does so only by cross-referencing another law without even mentioning what it is. Democrats say they had no idea the provision was even in there. But now, their objections to it have stalled the law and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is stalling Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination to be attorney general until the stalemate is resolved.\n\nAlthough this is its first time in the headlines, the sex trafficking shell game is not new; it\u2019s been going on for some time now, away from the limelight, in at least five distinct ways.\n\n1. Money with Religious Strings Attached\n\nThe first is when money designed to fight sex trafficking is used to advance a conservative ideological agenda. In 2006, for example, the Bush administration granted $19 million to the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (the same conservative Catholic network that would later fight for religious exemptions to ObamaCare) to oversee the government\u2019s services to women under the Trafficking Victims Protection Act.\n\nAs revealed in a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, the USCCB gave the money disproportionately to religious groups, and demanded that not a penny provide counseling for either abortion or birth control. This was even true for victims of rape.\n\nIn other words, precisely the provision at issue in the Senate bill was already the policy under the USCCB sub-grant, which was discontinued by the Obama administration.\n\n2. Crack Down on Prostitution Instead\n\nA second tactic is to obtain federal grants to combat human trafficking, but actually crack down on prostitution instead. For example, Las Vegas\u2014Sin City itself\u2014received a two-year, $500,000 federal grant in 2009 to combat trafficking, and the majority of the money went to overtime for vice cops arresting prostitutes. At the end of the grant period, Las Vegas could only report 10 cases of trafficking that they had busted as a result.\n\nThis is not an accident. Last year, Maggie McNeill, writing in The Washington Post, revealed internal documents of the anti-prostitution group Demand Abolition that said, \u201cFraming the Campaign\u2019s key target as sexual slavery might garner more support and less resistance, while framing the Campaign as combating prostitution may be less likely to mobilize similar levels of support.\u201d\n\nSo sexual slavery is just a rhetorical frame for eradicating prostitution.\n\nYet, as McNeill also pointed out, the two are often at cross purposes. If you really want to eliminate sex trafficking and sex slavery, the best policy choice would be to legalize and regulate prostitution. When this was tried in Australia and New Zealand, sex trafficking virtually disappeared. But of course, that\u2019s the last thing that sex trafficking activists from far-right institutions like Regent University want. Which is why it is never on the agenda.\n\nGiven the choice between fighting trafficking and fighting prostitution, social conservatives pretend to do the former, but actually do the latter.\n\n3. Recast Prostitutes as \u2018Victims\u2019\n\nPart of the \u201creframing\u201d of prostitution is to cast all pimps as traffickers, and all sex work as coercive.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe anyone\u2019s open to prostitution unless you\u2019ve been traumatized or abused,\u201d one New York judge recently told The Daily Beast. \u201cYou\u2019d beg, you\u2019d go on welfare, you\u2019d shoplift, for goodness\u2019 sake. These people need to be treated as victims.\u201d\n\nAmazingly, that judge works in New York\u2019s Human Trafficking Courts, set up to protect actual victims of trafficking\u2014but which now \u201cprotect\u201d all \u201cvictims,\u201d even adults who say they chose sex work voluntarily. As far as the system is concerned, those people are a null set.\n\nNot only is this an affront to sex workers\u2019 autonomy and humanity, it also leads to bad policy. In New York, sex workers are shipped off to \u201ccounseling\u201d with the foregone conclusion that their choices are wrong. That takes them away from their work, wastes money and time, and doesn\u2019t help make them safer.\n\n\u201cFraming the Campaign\u2019s key target as sexual slavery might garner more support and less resistance.\u201d\n\nIndeed, as the Beast article showed, the revamped system perpetuates racial profiling (blacks make up 69 percent of defendants in New York\u2019s human trafficking courts), stigma, and the risk of police violence.\n\nAnd what \u201ccounseling\u201d do sex workers receive? Like that annoying pop song, often it\u2019s just\u2026\n\n4. Take them to Church\n\nPhoenix, Arizona\u2019s Project ROSE (\u201cReaching Out on Sexual Exploitation\u201d) purports to protect sex workers, but as Vice reported in a long- form expose of the program, Project ROSE is actually a front for conservative religious \u201cre-education.\u201d\n\nSince 2011, the project has made over 350 arrests. But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. The law is deliberately vague, allowing police to \u201ccontact\u201d anyone who appears to be \u201cmanifesting prostitution.\u201d Surprise, surprise\u2014that has led to a disproportionate \u201ccontacting\u201d of transgender women of color, who have been routinely harassed by police and civilians alike.\n\nOnce \u201ccontacted,\u201d suspects are brought to a church, and threatened with arrest unless they enroll in a religiously-affiliated \u201cdiversion\u201d program. Since they haven\u2019t technically been arrested yet, they don\u2019t have the right to have lawyers present. Not surprisingly, many opt toward the \u201cdiversion\u201d program, which includes moral education courtesy of Catholic Charities. That means, of course, no condoms, no child-care, and no counseling on contraception or abortion. Just heavy doses of shaming, threats, and conservative moralism.\n\nThis is legal because it\u2019s \u201csecular\u201d counseling for victims of \u201ctrauma.\u201d Even if it just happens to comport with conservative Catholic dogma.\n\n5. Co-Opt the Narrative\n\nFinally, the whole narrative of anti-trafficking work has been co-opted by evangelicals and other social conservatives.\n\nPreviously, anti-trafficking was a feminist issue. It was about women kidnapped, brutalized, and subjugated by men.\n\nBut now, it\u2019s a religious issue. Two years ago, 60,000 conservative Christians gathered in the Georgia Dome \u201cfor worship and inspiration at the Passion 2013 conference\u201d designed \u201cto shine a light on modern-day slavery.\u201d\n\nDenuding \u201cslavery\u201d of its racial meaning (and thus its relevance for race issues today), conservative Christians cast themselves as the new abolitionists, \u201crescuing\u201d prostitutes from truck stops and rallying to end all forms of human trafficking\u2014even those which sex workers themselves say are non-exploitative.\n\nTo evangelicals, this is about victims and evildoers, not women and men. And the conceptual slippage is apparent.\n\nOne leading anti-trafficking activist told Slate that \u201call prostitution is inherently harmful. Whether or not it\u2019s consensual, whether or not they want to do it, if it\u2019s high-end or streetwalking, it\u2019s harmful, and it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nThat is an anti-feminist message; it\u2019s telling women that there is only one right way to use their bodies\u2014and just coincidentally, it\u2019s the way centuries of patriarchal religion have taught.\n\nLikewise, one evangelical pastor said recently that pornography contributes to sex trafficking. \u201cThe more people who watch pornography, the more they\u2019ll want sexual fulfillment through prostitution and so that desire drives men and women to engage in physical prostitution, even virtual prostitution. And so you\u2019ve got this relationship between pornography feeding prostitution and that increasing the demand for sex trafficking.\u201d\n\nAnd, he added, \u201cThe same Gospel that compels us to war against sex trafficking compels us to address sexual immorality in all its forms.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, is the main point. Religious crusaders against sex trafficking say they\u2019re against trafficking\u2014but really, they\u2019re against sex.\n\nTrafficking is the \u201ctip of the wedge,\u201d where evangelicals might make common cause with liberals and feminists. But ultimately, the wedge includes pornography, sex work, homosexuality, sex for pleasure, abortion, contraception\u2014anything that might be construed as \u201csexual immorality.\u201d That broader agenda is evident in the way that sex trafficking laws have been written and enforced, and in the way the religious anti-trafficking movement has cast the struggle.\n\nIronically, the Senate Republicans who have dug in their heels on the Lynch nomination may have dug the grave of the sex trafficking shell game. At the very least, they\u2019ve shined a harsh light on what had long been a quietly effective way to fight the culture war, by pretending to fight something else.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:39.815+0000"}

But I cannot. Because I believe our very identity as an exceptional nation is at stake, and I can make a difference as president,\u201d Rubio told the crowd Monday evening as he announced his run.\n\nAlthough Bush\u2019s name was never mentioned, the comparison between the two Florida politicians is hard to miss.\n\nIn fact, Rubio\u2019s entire life story\u2014which he will not be shy about telling over the coming months\u2014stands in sharp contrast to Bush\u2019s upbringing.\n\nWhile Bush is the son and brother of presidents, as well as a member of one of America\u2019s most storied political families, Rubio\u2019s parents were a bartender and a maid.\n\n\u201cMost people who have ever lived were trapped by the circumstances of their birth, destined to live the life their parents had. But America is different. Here, we are the children and grandchildren of people who refused to accept this,\u201d Rubio told the crowd at Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, built in the 1920s and now home to a memorial in honor of Cuban refugees.\n\n\u201cBefore us now is the opportunity to author the greatest chapter yet in the amazing story of America. We can\u2019t do that by going back to the leaders and ideas of the past. We must change the decisions we are making by changing the people who are making them,\u201d he continued.\n\nThis was no renegade Senate campaign, like the one Rubio launched in 2009 to defeat Charlie Crist and vault himself onto the national stage.\n\nIn front of a capacity crowd of some 1,000 supporters, Rubio\u2019s presidential campaign launch featured some of the glitz that his campaign six years ago lacked. Stars were projected onto the ceiling; tall American flags flanked ornate Corinthian columns from the front to the back of the room. More supporters, who couldn\u2019t make it into the launch event, crowded around an outdoor screen set up across the street.\n\n\u201cI have heard some suggest that I should step aside and wait my turn. But I cannot.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn many countries, the highest office in the land is reserved for the rich and powerful. But I live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams and the same future as those who come from power and privilege,\u201d Rubio told the cheering crowd.\n\nThere are already tensions between the Bush and Rubio camps as they grapple over similar bases of support for donors and votes.\n\nLast week, after two Florida associates of casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson held a fundraiser in support of Rubio, Bush\u2019s camp made it widely known that it feared the money would be ultimately used to attack Bush. It was a sign that Bush\u2019s camp was anxiously settling into its GOP front-runner status.\n\nIn some ways it\u2019s always been a complicated relationship, with some insisting that the former governor was a mentor to the now-senator. But those who know them both play down their personal closeness\u2014or at least say it\u2019s impossible to know.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think even their most senior people understand that dynamic,\u201d said a Florida political operative with ties to both camps.\n\nSupporters, however, insisted that there was no direct competition between the two Floridians.\n\n\u201cMarco has always talked about American exceptionalism,\u201d said Rubio supporter and former Florida House majority leader Adam Hasner. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any direct attempt to distinguish himself from Jeb Bush. Marco is going to run his own campaign.\u201c\n\nFor Rubio, the setting of his presidential launch was important.\n\n\n\n\u201cI chose to make this announcement at the Freedom Tower because it is a symbol of our nation\u2019s identity as the land of opportunity,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cIn this very room five decades ago, tens of thousands of Cuban exiles began their new lives in America. Their story is part of the larger story of the American miracle.\u201d\n\nThe son-of-an-immigrant approach doesn\u2019t always work with voters: Recall that Michael Dukakis, whose parents were both immigrants, lost big to Jeb Bush\u2019s father, George H.W. Bush.\n\nAnd in February, a Quinnipiac poll showed that Rubio trailed Bush among registered Republicans in Florida.\n\nBut Rubio sent a message with his campaign launch Monday evening: He\u2019s not waiting.

It\u2019s all quite complicated. But here, it seems to me, is your cut-to-the-chase question: Is there enough good faith in this United States Senate for something to be worked out? Or is it just impossible?\n\nOne proceeds from the assumption that the Senate will do whatever it can to kill a deal. It\u2019s a Republican Senate, by a pretty wide margin (54-46); history would suggest that these Republicans simply aren\u2019t going to hand President Obama a win like this. It hardly matters what the details are, about what Iran can or can\u2019t do at Fordow, about the \u201csnapback\u201d provisions of the sanctions, about the inspections regime, or about what precise oversight role Congress has. It\u2019s just basically impossible to imagine that this Republican Party, after everything we\u2019ve seen over these last six years, and this Republican Senate majority leader, who once said it was his job to make Obama a one-term president, won\u2019t throw up every roadblock to a deal they can conjure.\n\nOnce again, we\u2019re left separating out the factors the way scientists reduce compounds to their constituent elements in the lab. How much of this is just Obama hatred? How much is (this is a slightly different thing) the conviction\u2014quite insane, but firmly held\u2014that he doesn\u2019t have the best interests of the United States at heart? How much is a genuinely paranoid, McCarthy-ish world view about the intractably evil nature of our enemy and the definitional Chamberlainism of ever thinking otherwise?\n\nAnd how much is just self-interested politics, as it is bequeathed to us in its current form? Which is to say\u2014if you are a Republican senator, you simply cannot cast a vote that can be seen as \u201cpro-Obama\u201d under any circumstances. You just can\u2019t do it.\n\nI asked in a column last week whether there would be one Republican officeholder in Washington who might say, \u201cHey, upon examination of the details, this looks like a decent deal with risks that are acceptable, and I\u2019m going to support it?\u201d It\u2019s still a good question. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona is conceivable. He called that noxious Tom Cotton letter \u201cnot appropriate.\u201d But Flake is pretty new to the Senate and doesn\u2019t carry a lot of weight on these matters.\n\nSome suggest Corker himself. Corker has this reputation, in part earned, as one of the reasonable ones. He gets articles written about him like this one, from The New York Times a couple of days ago, which limned him as a Republican of the old school, a sensible fellow who still wants to horse-trade.\n\nIt\u2019s just basically impossible to imagine that this Republican Party, after everything we\u2019ve seen over these last six years, and this Republican Senate majority leader, who once said it was his job to make Obama a one-term president, won\u2019t throw up every roadblock to a deal they can conjure.\n\nAnd he is\u2014but only up to a point, at which the horses return to their stalls. The most notable example here is the Dodd-Frank bill. This is all detailed at great and exacting length by Robert Kaiser in his excellent book about how financial reform became law, Act of Congress. Then, Corker talked for hours and hours with Chris Dodd about the particulars\u2014derivatives reform, oversight of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, more. He wanted to play ball, even thought he might deliver some votes. But as time passed, it became clear to Corker that the base just wasn\u2019t standing for it. He faced reelection in 2012. Not tough reelection\u2014he won with 64 percent of the vote. But reelection campaigns are great excuses for senators to do nothing, and nothing is what Corker did. He withdrew from all participation with Dodd and Frank, and he ultimately voted against the bill. When it mattered, he caved to the extremists, in other words, among his colleagues and in his base. Why that means he should be getting credit for a spirit of compromise now in New York Times articles is something that, to my obtuse mind, requires further explanation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not Tom Cotton.\u201d Uh, okay. Wonderful. But that\u2019s where we\u2019ve come, celebrating a guy because he doesn\u2019t want to start World War III. Happily, though, all is not lost. It\u2019s far from clear that Corker or Cotton (and yes, they are different) can block a deal. There are, I\u2019m told, three categories of senators on this question. The first is our own mullahs\u2014no deal no how. The second is a group of mostly Democrats and independents\u2014Virginia\u2019s Tim Kaine, who is a close ally of the White House, and Maine\u2019s Angus King\u2014who basically want a deal but want to be sure that it\u2019s good, and want to influence the shape of any legislation the Senate might pass.\n\nThe third group is senators who also basically would like to see a deal but want the Senate to serve as a backstop against a deal they see as bad. I\u2019d put Chuck Schumer in that third camp. So when these people say they back the Corker bill, as Schumer did this week, it doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re against the administration or a deal per se. Democrats aren\u2019t going to be Obama\u2019s problem here. A few, the ones from the deep red states, may be boxed in. But most will stick with the administration, if a deal is finalized along current terms.\n\nI don\u2019t think our mullahs have the numbers right now. But Obama is going to have to sell this to more parties than Tom Friedman and Steve Inskeep. He has, or should have, Friedman\u2019s readers and Inskeep\u2019s listeners already. The way to get someone like Corker to play ball is to sell it in Knoxville. Public opinion still influences foreign policy, as Obama knows from his Syrian experiences.

(A spokesman for the RJC told The Daily Beast that they do not comment on these \u201cissues.\u201d)\n\n\n\nLast year\u2019s RJC meeting at Adelson\u2019s Venetian drew potential candidates led by Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Chris Christie, and John Kasich.\n\nBut these RJC bashes are only part of a longer and intense\u2014though sometimes whimsical\u2014Adelson primary wherein candidates court the multi-billionaire while he has an opportunity to size up their policy positions, qualifications, and characters. In recent months in Las Vegas and Washington, Adelson has had several one-on-one chats or attended small events with other GOP hopefuls seeking to win his heart, mind, and big checkbook.\n\nIn February, for instance, former UN ambassador John Bolton, who also is mulling a White House run, unveiled the Foundation for American Security and Freedom to promote hawkish national-security stances and make them a high priority in the 2016 elections. Conservative sources say that Adelson wrote a seven-figure check to fund the outfit.\n\nSarah Tinsley, the director of the Bolton foundation, declined to comment on whether Adelson had made a donation. Bolton, who spoke at last year\u2019s RJC event and recently penned a New York Times op-ed calling for bombing key Iranian nuclear facilities, has been \u201caggressively raising money\u201d in recent months and \u201cfundraising is going extremely well,\u201d Tinsley said. Bolton\u2019s new group is aiming to raise more than $5 million, she added, and expects to start running digital ads and deploying other tools in the second or third quarter this year.\n\nEver since a 2010 Supreme Court ruling opened the floodgates for corporations, individuals, and unions to give unlimited sums to outside groups directly advocating for or against candidates, Adelson has emerged as the biggest GOP campaign donor. In 2012, as I reported previously, the casino baron and his Israeli-born wife, Miriam, ponied up almost $150 million for various super PACs and politically active nonprofits, including ones tied to Karl Rove and to Charles and David Koch.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that mega donors, individually and collectively, are undermining our democracy,\u201d said Daniel Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Israel.\n\nNot long after, Adelson told a Wall Street Journal reporter that he was prepared to \u201cdouble\u201d his donations in 2016, a commitment that in good measure is driven by his ardent support for Israel and close political and personal bond with conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Adelson as well has voiced vehement opposition to a Palestinian state and is considered a strong critic of the proposed nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nSome former government officials have joined watchdog groups in decrying the growing influence of Adelson and other mega donors on the political landscape. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that mega donors, individually and collectively, are undermining our democracy,\u201d said Daniel Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Israel under President George W. Bush who is now a professor of Middle East Studies at Princeton. \u201cThere has been influence by people like Sheldon Adelson, who is on the public record as articulating very hard-line, right-wing positions on Israeli-Palestinian issues.\u201d A spokesperson at Adelson\u2019s Sands Corporation declined to respond to questions for this article.\n\nAdelson is typically blunt about his views on Israeli security matters. The casino owner has called the Palestinians a \u201cmade-up nation... whose existence is to destroy Israel.\u201d And Adelson drew criticism from at least one prominent Jewish leader for reportedly remarking last fall at a Washington, D.C., conference of the Israeli American Council that \u201cI don\u2019t think the Bible says anything about democracy\u2026 Israel isn\u2019t going to be a democratic state... So what?\u201d The council, whose growing mission includes advocacy for an estimated 800,000 Israeli Americans, received $22 million during two recent years from Adelson and his wife, according to The Jewish Daily Forward.\n\nWhile wooing Adelson to tap his big checkbook has become a growing priority for Republican candidates eyeing White House runs, the 81-year-old casino baron, whose net worth Forbes puts at almost $30 billion, is holding his cards close to his vest. The CEO and chairman of the Las Vegas Sands, the world\u2019s largest casino company, Adelson has signaled through a top aide that he won\u2019t start supporting a candidate until early next year.\n\nBut the allure of Adelson\u2019s seven- and eight-figure checks seems to have spurred some White House hopefuls to go the extra mile in adopting hard-line Israel stances that jibe with the casino magnate\u2019s views. Exhibit A: Jeb Bush\u2019s rapid response to a recent speech to the liberal Israel lobby J Street by former Secretary of State James Baker III, a prominent Bush foreign policy adviser.\n\nWhen Baker criticized Netanyahu for not working harder to achieve peace in the Middle East, Bush rushed to write a staunchly pro-Likud op-ed for National Review\u2014which attacked the Obama administration\u2019s negotiating stance with Iran over a nuclear deal\u2014apparently to defuse considerable dismay voiced by Adelson and other major Jewish donors.\n\nTo vent his displeasure over the Baker speech, Adelson, among others, reportedly spoke to Mel Sembler, a close friend and fellow RJC board member, who\u2019s already raising big bucks for Bush\u2019s pre-campaign committees, according to a GOP source close to the Bush operation.\n\n\u201cEverybody was upset about it [Baker\u2019s talk],\u201d said one RJC board member with ties to Adelson, adding that \u201cJeb did what he needed to do.\u201d Other Adelson confidantes say Baker\u2019s talk has inflicted more lasting damage on Bush with some Jewish conservative donors\u2014including perhaps with the casino owner himself. \u201cMany important donors I\u2019ve spoken to who care about Israel are disenchanted with Jeb Bush because of Baker\u2019s talk and his role as an adviser,\u201d said Morton Klein, the president of the Zionist Organization of America, another hawkish group of which Adelson has been a principal underwriter.\n\nAdelson\u2019s fervent support for Netanyahu\u2019s policies was palpable during the recent elections when the Israeli leader won a fourth term. In 2007 Adelson financed the launch of a free daily newspaper, Israel Hayom, that now boasts the largest circulation in the country (the paper reportedly hiked its print run by almost 70 percent before the elections). \u201cAdelson\u2019s paper is known very clearly as a major political platform for Netanyahu and his policies,\u201d said Ed Djerejian, an ambassador to Israel under President Bill Clinton who previously held State Department posts under Presidents George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan. As Netanyahu was fighting for his political life, \u201cHayom reflected [his] focus on security and helped him get the word out,\u201d added Djerejian, the founding director of Rice University\u2019s Baker Institute for Public Policy.\n\nThe casino owner\u2019s influence was on display last month in Washington when he jetted into the city to take a front-row gallery seat for Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress. During Adelson\u2019s stay in the nation\u2019s capital, Cruz and a few other chosen senators who are mulling or have just announced White House runs\u2014including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Marco Rubio of Florida, and Rand Paul of Kentucky\u2014got private time with him or were at small events where he was a prominent figure.\n\nWhile in Washington, Adelson also co-chaired a fundraising event for Graham\u2019s political committee, which Graham is using to test the waters while he weighs jumping into the GOP race.\n\nGraham is one of Congress\u2019s most ardent backers of Israel, but he also recently endeared himself further to the casino owner by sponsoring a Senate bill to ban Internet gambling, a top priority for Adelson and one that he\u2019s bankrolling by hiring a team of high-priced lobbyists and making big campaign donations. The Graham event had another twist when former Senator Norm Coleman of Minnesota made a fundraising pitch for a new conservative national-security advocacy group he co-founded with two other ex-senators (Indiana Democrat Evan Bayh and Georgia Republican Saxby Chambliss).\n\nDubbed the American Security Initiative, the group helped push for legislation that mandates congressional review of any nuclear deal with Iran, a shift that could create obstacles for the Obama administration. \u201cA few people stepped forward to support the initiative at the Graham event,\u201d Coleman said in an interview. \u201cIt was a very good place to make a presentation.\u201d Days later the fledgling outfit mounted a $500,000 ad blitz on cable television.\n\nColeman, a close Adelson ally and an RJC board member, added that he \u201cfully anticipates there will be further activities and ad buys.\u201d A GOP source said Adelson is expected to help fund the new security group, but Coleman declined to comment. Coleman added that one of two older groups he chairs, which back House GOP candidates and have pulled in about $20 million from Adelson and his wife in the last two elections, according to public documents and GOP sources, might get involved this year in promoting tougher national-security stances.\n\nAs Adelson surveys the early 2016 field Cruz is one of a few candidates to have had private meetings with the casino owner since last fall and seems to be spurring some interest, despite his weak standing with many in the GOP establishment, say some Adelson allies. But other Adelson confidantes, who are closer to the mainstream wing of the GOP, say Adelson thinks Cruz is probably a long shot because of his Tea Party brand of conservatism.\n\nAdelson, who seems far from settled on any candidate yet, has also gotten together in recent months with Walker and Rubio. Rubio boasts very strong hawkish Israel credentials and other foreign policy views that appeal to Adelson. Walker has a famously solid anti-union record that\u2019s a plus with Adelson, whose casinos have long been non-union.\n\nAdelson, whom a few GOP operatives deem mercurial at times, has indicated through aides that the bar for his financial support will be higher this time than in 2012, and that he badly wants to see the GOP win the White House. Still, the casino billionaire could be torn between his penchant for backing a candidate in the primaries very closely in sync with his hawkish views and one with the best shot at winning the nomination and the presidency.\n\nIn 2012, Adelson and his wife poured some $15 million into a super PAC that was largely responsible for sustaining a brief primary run by a longtime political ally, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, which helped delay Mitt Romney from winning the nomination. The Adelsons later chipped in $30 million to a super PAC supporting Romney, about whom the casino owner early on voiced skepticism.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:40.624+0000"}
{"entityId": 1795, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The notorious Clinton operative pushes a pro-Israel Libyan government in his emails to Hillary, but sells his son\u2019s anti-Israel book in public.\n\nIt\u2019s a shame that Hillary Clinton wasn\u2019t able to convince the Obama White House to let Sidney Blumenthal serve under her at the State Department. Blumenthal, the liberal journalist-turned-Clinton family consigliere, earned himself quite the reputation during the bruising 2008 Democratic primary, when his main job seemed to be sending out mass emails chock full of links to lurid stories about Barack Obama culled from the very \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d that he had combatted his entire adult life.\n\nAccording to Politico, for his efforts, Blumenthal earned the moniker \u201cSulfur-Breathing Spawn of Hell\u201d from Obama campaign staffers. That Clinton ever thought she had a chance of putting Blumenthal on the State Department payroll says something about her chutzpah.\n\nIf only those embittered Obama staffers had let bygones be bygones and harnessed the acumen of the inveterate emailer, they might have been able to strike a major blow for Middle East peace.\n\nBuried in the pages of once-confidential missives that Blumenthal sent to Clinton during her tenure at the State Department, since subpoenaed by a congressional committee investigating the 2011 attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, was a claim that the then-interim president of Libya, Mohammed Yussef el-Magariaf, wanted to \u201cseek a discreet relationship with Israel.\u201d According to a \u201csensitive source,\u201d Blumenthal wrote, \u201cpolitical realities in Libya at present will dictate that this relationship be handled in a low key manner, but the new President of Libya shares many common friends and associates with the leaders of Israel and intends to take advantage of this situation to improve the lot of the Libyan people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s entirely possible that this information was overly optimistic, if not entirely false. Forwarding the email onto an aide, Clinton expressed skepticism, prefacing her remark that the news was \u201cencouraging\u201d with \u201cif true.\u201d When Seymour Hersh, himself a man known for an overactive imagination, questions the validity of your information (as he did Blumenthal\u2019s claims, made in another email to Clinton, that Hersh was preparing to interview an ousted Muammar Gaddafi hiding in Chad), it\u2019s a discouraging sign.\n\nBut what\u2019s most revealing about Blumenthal\u2019s giddy hopes for a potential Libyan-Israeli rapprochement is how much it differs from other sentiments he had expressed about the Jewish state. For it wasn\u2019t so long ago that Sidney Blumenthal was hawking the vitriolic anti-Israel book published by his son, Max, and attacking those who had criticized it.\n\nIn the course of a short career, the younger Blumenthal gradually exiled himself from respectable journalistic outlets, and so several years ago decided to reinvent himself as Israel\u2019s most outspoken and extreme Jewish antagonist, at one point writing for a Beirut-based newspaper aligned with the Assad regime in Syria, before deciding that the blood-drenched regime in Damascus was no longer to his liking. His 2013 book Goliath is so venomous in its denunciations of Israel, and so strident in its defense of terrorism against it, that Eric Alterman, himself a harsh critic of Israel and a columnist for the far-left Nation magazine, concluded that it \u201ccould have been published by the Hamas Book-of-the-Month Club (if it existed) without a single word change once it\u2019s translated into Arabic.\u201d\n\n\u201c[W]hat\u2019s most revealing about Blumenthal\u2019s giddy hopes for a potential Libyan-Israeli rapprochement is how much it differs from other sentiments he had expressed about the Jewish state.\u201d\n\nThe book is replete with comparisons of Israeli Jews to Nazis, and calls for the ethnic cleansing of Jews from the Middle East. The book\u2019s last chapter, \u201cExodus,\u201d a riff on Jewish biblical history and the Leon Uris tome of the same name, envisions the reverse Exodus of the Jews out of their homeland. Asked at a 2013 event about what he believes should happen to Israel\u2019s Jews, Blumenthal fils responded, \u201cThere should be a choice placed to the settler-colonial population\u201d (that is, the Jewish population): \u201cBecome indigenized\u2026you have to be part of the Arab world.\u201d Those who don\u2019t? \u201cThe maintenance and engineering of a non-indigenous demographic majority is non-negotiable.\u201d In other words, leave or suffer.\n\nWhen Max\u2019s book came under attack from Alterman, Sidney did what he does best: he launched what Buzzfeed described as \u201can online campaign\u201d against the Nation columnist. According to Alterman, \u201cI worried that by telling the truth about his son\u2019s book, I would soon hear of nasty e-mails about me sent by Sid to our mutual friends and professional acquaintances. Call it \u2018bizarre,\u2019 if you will, but sadly, that\u2019s just what happened.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to love your son, and another entirely to endorse his controversial work (Sidney hosted a book party for Max) and attack those who criticize it. By doing so, Blumenthal the elder identified himself as a sponsor of his son\u2019s calumnies.\n\nNot that everyone hated Goliath. Frazier Glenn Cross, the 73-year-old white supremacist who murdered three people at Kansas Jewish Community Center and retirement home last year, was one of Blumenthal\u2019s biggest devotees. \u201cJew journalist Max Blumenthal exposes and explains this attempt by a foreign government Israel, to buy the presidential election for the neo-con, war-mongering republican establishment,\u201d Cross wrote on a Ron Paul fan site in 2012, referencing an interview Blumenthal gave on the Russian government-funded RT network. A survey of a white supremacist web forum run by Cross found over 300 references to Blumenthal and his work, with posters lauding his exposes of nefarious Jewish influence.\n\nLast year, Max earned himself the distinction of being barred from the German Bundestag after he chased the leader of the country\u2019s Left Party into a toilet, demanding to know why the parliamentarian had put the kibosh on a talk Blumenthal was scheduled to give at the invitation of two Left Party members. Scheduled to speak on the day after the anniversary of Kristallnacht, outraged party members initiated a petition criticizing their colleagues\u2019 hosting Blumenthal, which they said amounted to \u201cstoking obsessive hate and demonization of Israel with an anti-Semitic argument pattern and trivialization of the Holocaust.\u201d\n\nThe Clintons value loyalty about all else, and it\u2019s hard to imagine Sidney Blumenthal doing anything that would make Hillary consider him a liability. But Blumenthal\u2019s freelance diplomacy raises an intriguing question: who is the real Sidney Blumenthal? The one promoting Israel\u2019s interest in the broader Middle East by trumpeting a Libyan politician eager to make peace with the Jewish state? Or the one who promotes his son\u2019s work portraying Israel as a uniformly ghastly, racist country and American Jews as its disloyal double agents?\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:41.433+0000"}

And is the 99 percent getting just 1 percent of all new income?\n\nBy Lauren Carroll and Aaron Sharockman\n\nA clause about abortion funding in an otherwise uncontroversial sex-trafficking bill has stopped the Senate from voting to confirm President Obama\u2019s nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch.\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, liberal Juan Williams and conservative Karl Rove debated who\u2019s to blame.\n\nWe\u2019ll get into the clause and the stalemate in a second. But here\u2019s the relevant part of the back-and-forth from Williams and Rove. Rove claimed that Republicans are simply trying to extend a prohibition against using federal funding for most abortions that has been in place for nearly 40 years.\n\nDemocrats claim the prohibition isn\u2019t needed in this particular piece of legislation (it\u2019s in others), and Williams and others have accused the GOP of quietly inserting the abortion language to try to score political points.\n\n\u201cThe Republicans hid this language,\u201d Williams said.\n\n\u201cIt was right there in the bill. And the Democrats voted for it,\u201d Rove countered. \u201cJuan\u2026it\u2019s dangerous for you to keep doing this kind of stuff and for me having to correct you. The language was in the bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it.\u201d\n\nRove\u2019s claim rates Mostly True.\n\nThe abortion-related provision is called the Hyde Amendment, which first passed about 40 years ago and is named after the original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL). The amendment bars federal funding for most abortions. The full bill doesn\u2019t plainly say anything about abortion or the Hyde Amendment but says: \u201cAmounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund, shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014.\u201d (Those sections of the appropriations act are Hyde limitations.)\n\nSenate Democrats didn\u2019t put two and two together until after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed it unanimously in late February.\n\nThe Democrats accused the Republicans of hoodwinking them. The Senate debated a version of the bill last year, and that version did not include Hyde Amendment language, and they said Republicans didn\u2019t notify them of the change.\n\nIn January, a Republican Judiciary Committee staffer emailed the Democratic counterpart a summary of changes, but the list did not mention the addition of the abortion language, according to The Washington Post.\n\nSo who was Rove referring to when he said, \u201cThe Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it\u201d?\n\nA spokesperson for Rove told us he was referring to Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of the original co-sponsors of the bill.\n\n\u201c99 percent of all new income today [is] going to the top 1 percent.\u201d\n\nKlobuchar\u2019s office released a statement on March 18 saying a staffer in Klobuchar\u2019s office had known about the insertion of the Hyde Amendment before the Senate Judiciary Committee vote but \u201cdid not inform the senator.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe senator was not aware that the provision was included\u201d when she voted for the bill in committee, the statement said.\n\nSo, yes, Klobuchar\u2019s office says a staffer knew the measure was in the bill. And Klobuchar did vote for it.\n\nBut Rove is pushing things by linking the two events so closely together. There is no evidence Klobuchar knew the measure was in the bill and voted for it anyway\u2014which is what you might interpret Rove\u2019s statement to mean.\n\nAnd Klobuchar has voted to block a final vote on the bill since the provision became widely known.\n\n***\n\nFox News Sunday also interviewed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who is considering running against Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nSanders, who often cites statistics that highlight income inequality, offered this one in his interview with host Chris Wallace: \u201c99 percent of all new income today [is] going to the top 1 percent,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nThat rates Mostly True.\n\nSanders\u2019s office told us the senator was talking about pre-tax income growth from 2009-13 during his Fox interview. A Sanders spokesman highlighted a New York Times Upshot article in January by Justin Wolfers, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics and professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan.\n\nWolfers based his calculations on the work of University of California Berkeley economics professor Emmanuel Saez, who uses pre-tax income reported on IRS filings in his studies of top incomes, including capital gains. Saez and French economist Thomas Piketty have written about the disparate recovery from the recession between America\u2019s two big income classes for several years. Saez found most recently that the top 1 percent captured 91 percent of all income gains from 2009-12.\n\nUsing Saez\u2019s preliminary 2013 numbers, Wolfers stretched the window to account for an average of 2012-13 incomes (He used an average for those years because tax rates on top earners increased in 2013, prompting some to shift more income to 2012.).\n\nThe takeaway?\n\nThe average income for the richest 1 percent of Americans, excluding capital gains, rose from $871,100 in 2009 to $968,000 from 2012-13, he wrote. The 99 percent, on the other hand, experienced a drop in average incomes from $44,000 to $43,900, Wolfers said. The calculation excludes government benefits in the form of Social Security, welfare, tax credits, food stamps and so on.\n\n\u201cThat is, so far all of the gains of the recovery have gone to the top 1 percent,\u201d Wolfers wrote.\n\nSanders spokesman Jeff Frank said his office double-checked the statistic with Wolfers, who double-checked his own work with Saez.\n\nSaez told PolitiFact that the key to understanding the statistic is knowing that it\u2019s measuring pre-tax, pre-government benefit income.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key stat to think about how the market allocates incomes in the first place,\u201d Saez said. \u201cAnybody should be worried that the recovery from the Great Recession has been so skewed in terms of market incomes.\u201d\n\nThe caveat, economists including Saez said, is that if you include taxes paid by Americans and the government benefits they receive, the disparity isn\u2019t as great. That data may be considered equally valid. But economists say specific data does not yet exist.\n\nKatie Sanders contributed to this report.

It\u2019s a good thing.\u201d\n\nThe white supremacist also questioned the legitimacy of Jorge Ramos after Trump threw the Univision anchor out of a press conference Tuesday in Iowa.\n\n\u201cI have not endorsed [Trump] either informally or formally, but I do endorse the conversation,\u201d Duke added. \u201cAnd I appreciate the fact that these issues are being raised.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose issues\u201d include a plan to deport all undocumented immigrants when Trump reaches the White House.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to keep Duke, who prefers to be called Dr. Duke on his website, on topic as he veers in and out of connecting the dots in a convoluted web that all leads back to the overpowering Zionist Jewish influence in media and government. It is ridiculous, he said, that he is referred to as a former Ku Klux Klan member while Nelson Mandela isn\u2019t labeled a former member of the Communist Party. But mostly Duke takes issue with everyone who is not a European American infringing on the lives of European Americans.\n\n\u201cTrump has made it very clear that he\u2019s 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a replacement of the American elite from the people who have founded America and now it\u2019s a Jewish elite,\u201d Duke said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s pretty ironic that you think about this Jewish elite and they\u2019re only 2 percent of the United States of America. There\u2019s something wrong with this picture. That\u2019s not diversity.\u201d\n\nAnd Duke is not certain that a President Trump would do anything to alleviate the situation.\n\n\u201cTrump has made it very clear that he\u2019s 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?\u201d Duke asked.\n\nThe candidate\u2019s daughter Ivanka Trump has publicly discussed her conversion to Judaism before her marriage, and her father has been billed as the most Israel-friendly GOP candidate in this election. All this makes Trump a little too untrustworthy for Duke to come out swinging on his behalf.\n\n\u201cThis is the reason why I have not endorsed Donald Trump, because I really have to evaluate these things,\u201d Duke said. \u201cBut I really think the Democratic Party and the Republican Party are completely under the sway of the Zionists who are ultimately damaging America and damaging the world.\u201d\n\nThe one thing that gives Duke any sort of hope about Trump is his firm stance on deporting all undocumented immigrants, whose presence in the United States Duke calls an \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s enduring obviously a lot of criticism,\u201d Duke said. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing like the criticism I got when I ran for office, but I think he\u2019s enduring criticism because he\u2019s\u2014kind of, with this rhetoric\u2014talking about America and the traditions of America and the heritage of America. You can see the composition of so many of his rallies and who they are. They are really the European American people, the non-Jewish European American people that are waking up. And I think that the Jewish elite in America fear this.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re worried about Trump because there\u2019s this big sleeping tiger which is the mass majority of European Americans.

And conservatives hate the establishment. Right?\n\nWrong.\n\nIn fact, the Bush family and the Falwell family are a match made in heaven. And their bond is likely to be a boon to Jeb\u2019s White House dreams.\n\nJerry Falwell, the single most influential conservative Christian power broker of the 20th century, founded Liberty in 1971 to foster evangelicals\u2019 political and cultural clout.\n\nSince then, the school has had some dramatic ups and downs, with the downs reaching their lowest in 1990 when the school faced $110 million in debt.\n\nBut Falwell died and God provided: Thanks in part to the pastor\u2019s hefty life insurance policy, the school paid its dues, got in the black, and catapulted to a higher place than ever in the conservative firmament.\n\nAnd even when it was short on money, it never lost its political cachet.\n\nThe histories of the university and the Bush dynasty are closely intertwined.\n\nIn 1980, former congressman and U.N. ambassador George H. W. Bush ran for the Republican presidential nomination with a less-than-red-meat record, and he was pro-choice as Reagan\u2019s vice president. His beliefs could have permanently soured his reputation with evangelicals.\n\n\u201cThere will be two political dynasties represented on that stage at Liberty University this weekend whose influence is not only undeniable, it's incalculable,\u201d said Johnnie Moore, a former senior vice president of Liberty University.\n\nThat\u2019s where Falwell comes in: The reverend endorsed Bush in the 1988 Republican presidential primary, even though Pat Robertson\u2014an evangelical televangelist whose ideological resume had much more overlap with Falwell\u2019s\u2014was also a contender.\n\nThis has often been chalked up to rivalry between the two preachers. But it was more than that.\n\n\u201cEstablishment recognizes establishment,\u201d said one prominent evangelical leader who was close with the late Falwell.\n\nAs he explained, Southern evangelicals have been part of their region\u2019s cultural establishment for decades, and in a way that their Northern counterparts couldn\u2019t have dreamed.\n\nWhen it comes to said cultural establishments, Northern evangelicals have been on the outside looking in, while those from the South have been on the inside looking out. So Southern evangelicals are much more comfortable with the possession and the exercise of cultural and political power than Northern evangelicals are. And nobody possessed and exercised political power quite like the Bushes, including Bush 41, a literal senator\u2019s son.\n\nSo Falwell had an immediate commonality with the Bushes that helped solidify their relationship. They may have differed in policy, theology, rhetoric and a host of other details. But in one key area, they had everything in common: In their respective spheres, they were boss.\n\n\u201cThese two families have each played an iconic role in modern, American politics, and their influence has intersected on not a few occasions,\u201d said Johnnie Moore, a former senior vice president of Liberty University.\n\n\u201cWhen it did intersect, it was a force to be reckoned with. There will be two political dynasties represented on that stage at Liberty University this weekend whose influence is not only undeniable, it's incalculable.\u201d\n\nIn 1990, Bush found himself at Liberty, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the reverend and delivering the commencement address to a crowd of evangelical voters who had helped secure his predecessor\u2019s legacy.\n\nAnd Bush 43 wasn\u2019t the only so-called establishment-type to win Falwell\u2019s imprimatur.\n\nA few years after Sen. John McCain put him on his list of \u201cagents of intolerance,\u201d the pastor invited him to deliver the university\u2019s 2006 commencement address.\n\nThe two broke bread, a reconciliation that boosted McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential efforts.\n\nAnd Falwell\u2019s son, Jerry Falwell Jr., invited Mitt Romney to give the school\u2019s 2012 commencement address. His decision to give that platform to a Mormon enraged many conservative Christians. But Jerry Jr. and Mitt Romney had commonality where it counted: They were both the heirs of dynasts.\n\nIf George H. W. Bush had a good relationship with the evangelicals in Falwell\u2019s orbit, George W. Bush had a magnificent one.\n\n\u201cIn 41, they\u2019d take our calls,\u201d said the aforementioned evangelical leader. \u201cIn 43, they\u2019d call us.\u201d\n\nAnd now it\u2019s Jeb\u2019s turn.\n\nAnd Liberty\u2019s protestants will likely make him feel right at home.\n\nAnd even though he\u2019s pledged allegiance to Rome, they still see him as one of their own: the kid brother of their favorite president ever and the unabashed social conservative icon who tried to keep Terri Schiavo alive.\n\nAnd, per excerpts of his speech provided to reporters in advance, Jeb will speak their language.\n\n\u201cWhatever the need, the affliction, or the injustice,\u201d he plans to say, \u201cthere is no more powerful or liberating influence on this earth than the Christian conscience in action.\u201d\n\n\u201cConsider a whole alternative universe of power without restraint, conflict without reconciliation, oppression without deliverance, corruption without reformation, tragedy without renewal, achievement without grace,\u201d he\u2019ll add, \u201cand it\u2019s all just a glimpse of human experience without the Christian influence.\u201d\n\nConsider a country without Falwell\u2019s influence, and you might be considering a country without the Bushes.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:41.886+0000"}

Your will superior to mine,\u2019\u201d Perry said. \u201cToday I submit that His will remains a mystery, but some things have become clear.

In return, Trump repeatedly referred to the Texas governor as dumb, once tweeting, \u201cHe should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to enter the GOP debate.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s exit from the race should be a chilling reminder to the other contenders of just what they\u2019re getting themselves into when they head to the CNN debate stage next week. Perry was an A-list candidate back in 2012, snatching Michele Bachmann\u2019s momentum from her Iowa Straw Poll win and drawing crowds. This time four years ago, he was leading the polls in the race for the 2012 GOP nomination.\n\nBut his one debate gaffe\u2014when he couldn\u2019t name the third federal agency he wanted to eliminate\u2014ended that effort. The damage lasted; Perry\u2019s \u201cwhoops\u201d flub came up in virtually all the coverage of his 2016 bid, and became the defining moment of his political career.\n\nWhich, some will convincingly argue, is unfair.\n\nThe governor presided over the implementation of criminal justice reform in Texas that resulted in prison closures, lower incarceration rates, and less crime. His willingness to embrace that issue made it easier for other conservative governors and legislatures to follow suit. And it gave political cover to Republican politicians in Washington, who followed his lead and embraced efforts to reduce mandatory minimum sentences for non-violent drug offenders.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough to get his campaign the requisite juice.\n\nNational Journal reported last month that some of his South Carolina campaign staffers had stopped getting paid. His state director there, Katon Dawson, promised CBS that the governor\u2019s team would \u201cbe able to live off the land for a while.\u201d And that\u2019s when it was clear the buzzards were circling.\n\nIn fact, while most people thought Perry couldn\u2019t go the distance, it was his nemesis, Trump, who said it in a recent press conference.\n\n\u201cPerry attacked me; now he\u2019s getting out of the race.

Awwwwwkward.\n\nHedge fund CEO Robert Mercer is all in for the conservative Texas Republican Ted Cruz, and the billionaire will have unusually substantial influence in how his contributions get spent.\n\nBut the billionaire also has some baggage\u2014like, the avoiding billions in taxes kind of baggage.\n\nHis alleged failure to pay those taxes led to substantial congressional scrutiny in 2014\u2014and it\u2019s not clear the investigation is over.\n\nThis, and some of Mercer\u2019s side projects, could present interesting challenges for Cruz\u2019s campaign. Especially since Cruz has been a vocal opponent of those who \u201cgive favors to Wall Street\u201d and engage in \u201ccrony capitalism.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, Mercer\u2019s support is fantastic for Cruz for all the obvious reasons (having a billionaire in your corner is nice). On the other hand, Mercer\u2019s hedge fund\u2014Renaissance Technologies\u2014recently faced an unflattering congressional investigation, the results of which indicated that it used complex and unorthodox financial structures to dramatically lower its tax burden.This drew scorching bipartisan criticism from investigators on the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations.\n\n\u201cRenaissance profited from this tax treatment by insisting on the fiction that it didn\u2019t really own the stocks it traded\u2014that the banks that Renaissance dealt with, did,\u201d said Sen. John McCain during a hearing on the issue, per Mother Jones . \u201cBut, the fact is that Renaissance did all the trading, maintained full control over the account\u2026and reaped all of the profits.\u201d\n\nIn his opening statement for that hearing, then-subcommittee chair Sen. Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, said that Mercer\u2019s business avoided paying more than $6 billion in taxes between 2000 and 2013.\n\nSince then, Levin has retired from the Senate and Republican Sen. Rob Portman has taken his place as subcommittee chair. When I called the subcommittee\u2019s Capitol Hill office to see if any investigation into Renaissance was still underway, the person who answered the phone said he couldn\u2019t comment on active investigations. I then asked if that meant the investigation was in fact active.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s active, I can\u2019t say whether it\u2019s inactive, I can\u2019t even say whether we\u2019ve investigated them,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cRenaissance profited from this tax treatment by insisting on the fiction that it didn\u2019t really own the stocks it traded\u2014that the banks that Renaissance dealt with, did,\u201d said Sen. John McCain.\n\nLater, Portman\u2019s spokeswoman, Caitlin Conant, emailed to say that the committee doesn\u2019t comment on its work beyond what\u2019s in the public record. Renaissance Technologies didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on whether they\u2019re currently being investigated.\n\nGiven this probe into his company\u2019s books, it\u2019s no surprise Mercer has invested heavily in keeping financial industry watchdogs from gaining political power. However, you\u2019d think this might conflict with his candidate\u2019s populist zeal.\n\n\u201c[M]y criticism with Washington is they engage in crony capitalism,\u201d Cruz told Bloomberg Politics . \u201cThey give favors to Wall Street and big business and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve been an outspoken opponent of crony capitalism, taking on leaders in both parties.\u201d\n\nBut the Cruz campaign doesn\u2019t seem to see any problems with the arrangement. When I asked Rick Tyler, the campaign\u2019s senior communications adviser, if he was worried about potential conflicts, he said, \u201cNo way.\u201d\n\nMercer has long backed conservative candidates, and he\u2019s spending heavily on Cruz through a new breed of super PACs started by the super rich.\n\nAn anonymous Cruz source told Bloomberg on Wednesday that a franchise of pro-Cruz super PACs\u2014formed just this week\u2014will have raised $31 million by end of the day on Friday. There are four super PACs, called Keep the Promise, Keep the Promise I, Keep the Promise II, and Keep the Promise III.\n\nThis is not normal; presidential candidates usually give their imprimatur to one such group, which then rakes in contributions and makes independent expenditures to help the candidate. After all, there are legal limits on how much donors can give to presidential candidates, but no limits on how much they can give to these PACs.\n\nOne longtime campaign lawyer said the widespread Republican donor buyer\u2019s remorse exists from the the 2012 general elections\u2014when a few powerful super PACs spent massive sums of money to get Mitt Romney elected, and were left empty-handed on Election Night. As a result, billionaires are starting their own PACs to fund political campaigns to have more control on how their money gets spent.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this explanation doesn\u2019t make sense to everyone. Dan Backer, an attorney who\u2019s worked extensively with Republican and Tea Party groups on campaign finance issues, said he thought having multiple super PACs could make life unnecessarily difficult for everyone involved.\n\n\u201cAll you\u2019re doing is multiplying your reporting and compliance burden for no good reason,\u201d he said. \u201cAt first blush, it just strikes me as a little weird.\u201d\n\nRegardless, the operating assumption seems to be that having a cadre of super PACs will give mega-donors like Mercer more power over the dynamics of the presidential election. Saul Anuzis, a Michigan Republican operative who started a Mercer-funded super PAC in the 2014 midterms, indicated as much in an interview with Mother Jones . He told the magazine that he expected to see \"more and more super-PACs starting that are donor-centric or district-centric.\u201d In Cruz and Mercer\u2019s case, that prediction seems remarkably prescient.\n\nIn 2010, 2012, and 2014 the billionaire spent significant money trying (unsuccessfully) to take out Oregon Democratic Representative Peter DeFazio, who has made his support of higher Wall Street taxes a signature issue. And DeFazio has used the fact that he\u2019s a Mercer target to burnish his fiscal-progressive bona fides.\n\nMercer helped Lee Zeldin defeat former Securities and Exchange Commission prosecutor George Demos in a 2014 Republican House race primary. Mercer also helped Zeldin win the general election, where he defeated a Democratic incumbent who was a vociferous defender of Dodd-Frank.\n\nBut his areas of interest are broader than just elections. He singlehandedly paid for a $1 million TV ad campaign opposing the so-called Ground Zero Mosque. And his affinity for conservative causes seems to go back to his early days doing research for the Kirtland Air Force Base\u2019s weapons lab in New Mexico.\n\nMercer hinted at his political evolution in a 2014 speech he gave to accept the Association for Computational Linguistics lifetime achievement award. He described rewriting a computer program so that it worked more efficiently, and then said that his bosses at the lab decided to just make the program do more complicated computations.\n\n\u201cI took this as an indication that one of the most important goals of government-financed research is not so much to get answers as it is to consume the computer budget, which has left me ever since with a jaundiced view of government-financed research,\u201d he said.\n\nExcepting Zeldin, Mercer\u2019s chosen candidates haven\u2019t fared particularly well. The billionaire spent $1 million to help pay for the 2012 Republican National Convention, and also gave Karl Rove\u2019s Crossroads GPS significant funds to try to boost Republicans\u2019 fortunes. And he spent $200,000 on Wendy Long\u2019s Senate race. Who\u2019s Wendy Long, you ask? Right.\n\nThere\u2019s a kind of funny flip in the media narrative here, too. After Cruz announced that he would run, a Politico sub-hed blared that he was \u201cmonths behind his competitors in recruiting mega-donors and bundlers.\u201d If the storied $31 million materializes, then those concerns were probably meritless.\n\nBut, to paraphrase the poet, with new money comes new problems. And it remains to be seen how a cozy alliance with a guy whose hedge fund allegedly dodged $6 billion in taxes could play out for the senator.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:42.186+0000"}

But can she score with the voters who don\u2019t adore Elizabeth Warren?\n\nWell, it looks like Hillary Clinton is running after all, and she\u2019s making it official this Saturday at Franklin Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park. Conservative critics will pounce on the unintended symbolism and note that Roosevelt Island, in New York City\u2019s East River, used to be called Welfare Island, and that the island was once home to the city\u2019s lunatic asylum. But the intended symbolism is so un-missable as to constitute Symbolism for Dummies: The first two of FDR\u2019s freedoms were \u201cof speech\u201d and \u201cof worship,\u201d but the third one he appended to these more traditional rights was economic\u2014\u201cfrom want.\u201d (The fourth was \u201cfrom fear,\u201d which Roosevelt framed as a worldwide reduction in armaments, a freedom on which we\u2019ve not made stellar progress.)\n\nClearly, she\u2019s trying to express her inner Warren. This much we know. \u201cHow populist will she be?\u201d has been the dominant early-innings economic question about her candidacy, which is understandable since we\u2019re in the primary-election phase when Clinton has to reassure liberals. But here\u2019s a different economic question, which for the purposes of a general election is more important: How is she going to talk about jobs and wages in a way that connects with general-election voters who don\u2019t adore Elizabeth Warren?\n\nThis is where elections are usually won or lost. Journalists carry on about pants suits and email servers, but most of the time, political science is right and journalism is wrong. And political scientists, notes Bill Galston of the Brookings Institution, \u201cbelieve that the performance of the economy in the nine to 12 months prior to an election is the strongest determinant of the beliefs voters take with them into the polling booth.\u201d Disloyalist that I am to the pants-suits-email-server narrative, I agree. So let\u2019s start with this.\n\nHere\u2019s a good trivia question for you. Fill in the blank: If the economy keeps growing at the rate it has been lately, it will have created ____ million jobs during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency:\n\na. 5 million\n\nb. 8.3 million\n\nc. 11 million\n\nd. 22 million\n\nI designed this little quiz so that most of you would say b (although I bet a lot of you said a). But the correct answer, according to calculations posted by Bill McBride at the Calculated Risk blog last week, is c. Yep, 11 million. No, those aren\u2019t \u201cChicago numbers.\u201d They\u2019re the numbers. (And notice I didn\u2019t say \u201cObama created X jobs\u201d; I said the economy will have created 11 million jobs during his presidency, which acknowledges that job creation involves timing and luck.)\n\nCan Clinton just run on Obama\u2019s economic coattails the way Al Gore could\u2014or could have, if he\u2019d done it better\u2014in 2000?\n\nIn this context, let me now rewind your mind to that really interesting section of Bill Clinton\u2019s barnburner 2012 convention speech, when he compared the job-creation records of Democratic and Republican administrations. \u201cSince 1961, for 52 years now, the Republicans have held the White House 28 years, the Democrats 24,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIn those 52 years, our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what\u2019s the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 [million].\u201d Again, these are the numbers. PolitiFact judged this statement to be true.\n\nNow imagine how Hillary Clinton (or Bill again, in her behalf) can update this at the 2016 convention if McBride turns out to be right: \u201cNow the scorecard is even since 1961 in terms of years\u201428 years for them, 28 for us. The jobs score now? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 53 million.\u201d\n\nIf you ask me, that should be enough to win an election right there. But the economy might not just glide along between now and next November. There might be a slowdown or even recession. And even if there isn\u2019t, I wonder: Can Clinton just run on Obama\u2019s economic coattails the way Al Gore could\u2014or could have, if he\u2019d done it better\u2014in 2000?\n\nI think that\u2019s going to be tricky. If we start to see solid wage growth, around 3.5 percent, then maybe it\u2019ll all be fine. But if wage growth stays closer to the current 2.3 percent, voters\u2019 economic perceptions are only going to be okay, not great. Says the labor economist Stephen Rose: \u201cThe strongest pro-Obama statement one could make on the economy would be based on the counterfactual of what would have happened with a different set of policies, i.e., the Republican plan (like that of Cameron in the UK) of fiscal austerity. But people don\u2019t give credit based on counterfactuals.\u201d\n\nSo I think unless the economy is really soaring a year from now, Clinton is going to have to thread a needle. She\u2019ll need to find language and policies that can both reassure the Obama coalition and Warren-Sanders wing that she will fly the liberal flag while also signaling to swing voters that her vision amounts to more than checking boxes. This is the age-old mystery of presidential politics, and there ain\u2019t no formula for it. A candidate and her people just have to sniff the zeitgeist accurately (or at least poll it accurately) and be imaginative and smart.\n\nIf she\u2019s both smart and lucky, Clinton will have two things going for her. First, a lot of these \u201cliberal\u201d economic policies happen to be supported by huge majorities of the public. Did you catch this Times poll last week on economic questions? People don\u2019t like unions (although they don\u2019t like Wall Street even more), and they\u2019re against a financial transaction tax. Aside from those, the broader American public would be dismissed by Beltway arbiters as hopelessly left wing. Big majorities want the government to act now to reduce the gap between rich and poor; raise taxes on the rich; increase the minimum wage; offer paid family leave (that one is 80 percent); require employers to offer paid sick leave (85 percent). So maybe these so-called liberal positions are just kitchen-table common-sense positions.\n\nThe other thing she\u2019ll have going for her is the continuing stupidity and stinginess of the other side. When the GOP nominee opposes paid family leave, as he inevitably will, he\u2019ll be opposing something that has the support of 71 percent of Republicans. The Republican Party elite is ridiculously out of touch with where average Americans are. That\u2019s a message Clinton and all the Democrats should be pounding home.\n\nWe may not know what shape the economy will be in next fall, but we do know that public opinion is on the side of all these changes, and the Republicans are against them. It won\u2019t just be liberal voters who\u2019ll grasp this.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:42.503+0000"}

He said the conditions don\u2019t exist for a two-state solution; that the VA system needs to be reformed; that he\u2019s open to Ukraine joining NATO.\n\nCompare this to Jeb Bush\u2019s first big national security speech in February, before the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, where Bush mispronounced Boko Haram, misidentified Iraq, mistakenly placed the size of ISIS and couldn\u2019t remember the title of ISIS\u2019 Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.\n\nMeanwhile, Bush has spent the last few days in a quagmire: asked if he would have still invaded Iraq given the benefit of hindsight, he told Fox that he would have.

Then America.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is heading to Washington, D.C. next week to present a progressive \u201cContract with America,\u201d a 13-point agenda intended to push the Democratic Party leftward.\n\nAccording to a draft of the document provided to The Daily Beast by someone asked to join the effort, de Blasio will call for a number of measures for which he has already pushed in New York City, including national paid sick leave and free, universal pre-kindergarten and afterschool programs.\n\nDuring the 2013 mayoral campaign, de Blasio used his support of paid sick leave to pummel the Democratic front-runner, Council Speaker Christine Quinn, sparking his come-from-behind victory. De Blasio then signed an expansive law on the topic soon after becoming mayor. Universal pre-K became de Blasio\u2019s signature accomplishment of his first year in office, even if his mechanism to pay for it\u2014a tax on the city\u2019s upper-income earners\u2014was rejected by Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nThe contract will also put de Blasio in the center of some of the debates currently roiling Washington. According to a draft of the document circulated this week, de Blasio will call for the passage of comprehensive immigration and for Democrats to \u201coppose trade deals that hand more power to corporations at the expense of American jobs, workers\u2019 rights, and the environment.\u201d\n\nPresident Barack Obama has called for a new Pacific trade deal that he says would open up new markets for American goods. He has received little support for that view among Democrats, however, and Hillary Clinton has declined to back the agreement.\n\nAccording to a draft of the document circulated this week, de Blasio will call for the passage of comprehensive immigration and for Democrats to \u201coppose trade deals that hand more power to corporations at the expense of American jobs, workers\u2019 rights, and the environment.\u201d\n\nSome of the items on de Blasio\u2019s wish list have not yet been made a priority in his time as mayor, like universal free child care and a $15-per-hour minimum wage. The mayor has pushed for a $13 minimum wage indexed to inflation, which would not rise to $15 until 2019. The mayor\u2019s push locally for the $13 minimum wage has likewise been rejected by Albany.\n\nDe Blasio is expected to be joined in Washington by a more than 60 members of Congress, progressive activists, and labor leaders, among them Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley, Congressmen Keith Ellison and Raul Grijalva, and the actor Susan Sarandon. Last month de Blasio convened a number of progressive thinkers at Gracie Mansion, including Nation editor Katrina Vanden Heuvel and civil rights activist Van Jones to hash out ideas about how to build a progressive agenda in 2016. De Blasio has pointedly declined to endorse Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential bid, even though he was the campaign manager of her 2000 Senate run in New York and even though both Bill and Hillary Clinton were on stage with de Blasio at his inauguration.\n\nAides to de Blasio dismiss the suggestion that this effort is designed to lift de Blasio\u2019s profile, and say instead that it is intended to get a more progressive government into Washington, D.C.\u2014one that will be more attentive to New York City\u2019s needs. The contract is modeled on Newt Gingrich\u2019s Contract With America, which helped Republicans retake the House in 1994.\n\nMany of the items that de Blasio calls for are unlikely to pass, even with a Democratic president and a Democratic congress, such as the \u201cBuffet Rule,\u201d which would force millionaires to pay a higher tax rate.\n\nAmong some of the other items expected to be on de Blasio\u2019s agenda are a reform of the National Labor Relations Act \u201cto enhance workers\u2019 rights to organize and rebuild the middle class,\u201d the expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit, allowing students to refinance student loan debt, closing the carried interest loop, ending tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, and the closing of a \u201cCEO tax loophole that allows corporations to take advantage of \u2018performance pay\u2019 write-offs.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:43.493+0000"}

Let\u2019s rename it after a good man like Bob Dole.\n\nAs I write these words on Monday, the South Carolina State Senate is poised to remove the Confederate battle flag from its capitol grounds entirely. These developments in the Palmetto State and elsewhere are all positive, and of course it\u2019s high time for them. But Confederate battle flags on capitol grounds do not constitute the most conspicuous symbolic tribute to white supremacy in our political-architectural landscape.\n\nNo, the symbol I have in mind isn\u2019t to be found in Columbia or Montgomery or Baton Rouge or Jackson. It\u2019s right here in Washington, 2.6 miles from where I sit typing these sentences.\n\nHey, United States Senate: What in the world are you still doing with a building named in honor of Richard Russell?\n\nAs I trust you know, Richard Brevard Russell was a senator from Georgia from 1933 until his death in 1971. In his day, he was respected and revered. When you read about him you often read sentences like \u201cthe Senate was Russell\u2019s mistress, his true and only love\u201d; and indeed he never married, bore no children, and seems to have spent his waking hours thinking almost exclusively of how to bring honor and dignity to what we\u2019ve long since stopped calling the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body.\n\nAnd sometimes, he did bring honor upon that body. His chairmanship of a special joint committee into President Truman\u2019s firing of General Douglas MacArthur is considered a model of deliberative bipartisanship. It was a highly sensitive time that carried a Seven Days in May kind of whiff about it\u2014MacArthur wanted to invade China and enjoyed a huge popular following. It was an easy situation to demagogue, and Russell did not. So, yes, he did good.\n\nBut: He was a racist and a segregationist who, precisely because of the esteem in which he was held high even by Yankees for other reasons, may have done more to hold back civil rights and integration in this country than any other single individual, including Strom Thurmond and anyone else you care to name. Thurmond wrote the initial draft of the infamous 1956 Southern Manifesto, the resolution signed by Southern senators and House members stating their support for segregation and their refusal to obey Brown v. Board of Education. But Russell rewrote a lot of it and was a key or even the key figure in rounding up the votes against civil rights legislation.\n\nHe was a white supremacist\u2014not a cross-burning white supremacist, but a white supremacist all the same.\n\nHe was a white supremacist\u2014not a cross-burning white supremacist, but a white supremacist all the same. Does that sound harsh? Well, here (PDF) is something Russell said while campaigning in 1936, when his opponent was accusing him of supporting New Deal programs that would promote integration: \u201cAs one who was born and reared in the atmosphere of the Old South, with six generations of my forebears now resting beneath Southern soil, I am willing to go as far and make as great a sacrifice to preserve and insure white supremacy in the social, economic, and political life of our state as any man who lives within her borders.\u201d\n\nHe opposed every piece of civil rights legislation that came his way. In fact, he had participated in his first anti-civil-rights filibuster the year before that 1936 election, when he helped block an anti-lynching law. He helped block another anti-lynching law in 1938. After the war, according to political scientist Robert D. Loevy in his To End All Segregation, Russell was the leader of the Southern bloc. Want to understand how committed he was to that position? In 1952, he could have become part of the Democratic Party\u2019s Senate leadership structure. But going national in that way meant, as he knew, that he would have to soften his views on race. He refused.\n\nOn and on and on like this we could go. But here\u2019s all you really need to know. In 1964, after his party finally succeeded in leading the push for civil rights legislation, what did Russell do? Decide to change a little? Throw in the towel just a bit? Nope. He refused to attend the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City. And his racial views never changed.\n\nHe died in 1971, and they named the building after him the next year. Such were the times that his racism could be contextualized as an understandable and forgivable flaw. Maybe it\u2019s still understandable, given the time and place of his birth and rearing. But it\u2019s no longer forgivable to such an extent that one of only three Senate office buildings has to bear his name,\n\nThe other two Senate buildings, incidentally, are named after completely honorable men whose escutcheons carry no such stains. Everett Dirksen was a tad conservative for my tastes, but as the Republican leader in 1964, he did go along with LBJ and Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield in support of civil rights. And Democrat Phil Hart of Michigan was one of the great public servants of his time. Yes, his politics were my politics, but it was his sense of honor that most defined him. He once learned that an aide in his Detroit office was taking a little honest graft. Aghast, Hart called a Detroit newspaper reporter to give him the story; to bust himself. The reporter didn\u2019t run with it, telling Hart that no one would believe a Phil Hart-corruption story in the first place. This is what made his colleagues decide immediately that the new office building that was going up in the mid-1970s should be named in honor of their cancer-stricken colleague.\n\nSorry, a racist who spent 30 years making sure black children went to inferior schools and black adults couldn\u2019t vote doesn\u2019t deserve to be in their company. The Senate must change the name. But\u2026to what?\n\nSitting where I do on the ideological parking lot, I turn naturally toward a figure like Hubert Humphrey. He was a giant of the Senate, and I rather like the symbolism of erasing a racist\u2019s name and replacing it with the Senate\u2019s most forward-thinking and courageous integrationist.\n\nUS Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole during a mobilization event organized by the Coalition to Save Medicare in Washington, D.C., August 3, 1995. Dole, who was a candidate in the 1996 presidential race, discussed methods for keeping Medicare from going bankrupt. (David Ake/AFP/Getty)\n\nBut I\u2019ll tell you what. Let\u2019s not make this a partisan thing. So I say, give it to a Republican. How about the Robert Dole Senate Office Building? He\u2019s not exactly my dish of Kansas corn on a number of issues, but by cracky, as a young member of the House of Representatives, he voted for the civil rights bill in 1964. And then of course there was his later work on civil rights for the disabled. That\u2019s reversal enough of Russellism for me. And he\u2019s still alive, and it would be a nice thing for him, and into the bargain the Senate could make up for that shameful slap it administered to Dole\u2019s face three years ago over that UN disabilities treaty.\n\nMitch McConnell, get on it. You once worked for a great moderate Republican, John Sherman Cooper, one of the few Southerners who voted for the civil rights bill. Harry Reid, this ought to be a no-brainer for you. Senators Pat Leahy, Patty Murray, Kirsten Gillibrand\u2014you feel proud giving out your Washington address to your constituents? Somebody make a play here.

But the Obama administration has refused to finger the culprit: Beijing.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s top intelligence and law enforcement officials have concluded that China was almost certainly responsible for the massive hack that exposed highly sensitive information on millions of U.S. government employees.\n\nBut the Obama administration has so far refused to publicly accuse Beijing, despite their private conclusions. According to individuals familiar with internal deliberations on the subject, the White House has been reluctant to offend the Chinese in the midst of sensitive international negotiations. And there are concerns that exposing China could compromise U.S. intelligence-gathering techniques.\n\nNaming China would likely lead to calls for the administration to produce evidence of its claims. In that case, \u201cthere could be an issue with revealing sources and methods\u201d of intelligence-gathering, James Lewis, a top computer security expert who has spoken to senior administration officials about the hack against the Office of Personnel Management, told The Daily Beast.\n\nIntelligence agencies jealously guard their techniques for monitoring China\u2019s armies of hackers and tracing attacks back to them, fearful that were they exposed, streams of valuable intelligence could dry up. Revealing technical details of how the U.S. has attributed the breach of OPM to Chinese actors could tip off hackers to the ways that American intelligence agencies track them, said Lewis, a director and senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. Lewis added that in the OPM case, attributing the hack to China has been a less complicated matter than deciding when to point the finger.\n\nComputer security firm CrowdStrike, whose executives have close ties to U.S. law enforcement, has already traced the breach to hackers it says are \u201caffiliated with the Chinese government,\u201d using forensic information from the OPM hack provided by the government.\n\nQuestions of political timing have also complicated the question of when to call out China, according to two more individuals who have discussed the OPM attack with U.S. officials and asked not to be identified. On July 9, the administration released more details about the scope of the cyber breach, revealing for the first time that more than 22 million people\u2019s records were compromised. But blaming China then, amid final negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear program to which China was a party, would have been a significant distraction. Those talks have now concluded, but Chinese President Xi Jinping is also scheduled to come to Washington in September, and opening a public spat over the OPM hack could overshadow his visit.\n\nPresident Obama met with top Chinese leaders at the White House last month and raised his concerns over the country\u2019s \u201ccyber and maritime behavior,\u201d according to an official statement. But openly linking China to the OPM hack would escalate tensions and immediately raise the question of how the United States would respond. After accusing North Korea of hacking Sony Pictures Entertainment last year, Obama slapped new sanctions on the country. The U.S. launched targeted cyber attacks on North Korean computer networks.\n\nAdministration officials have previously said that they don\u2019t rule out imposing sanctions against individuals or organizations responsible for the OPM hack. After the Sony hack, the White House trumpeted a new sanctions regime designed to punish hackers and the countries, companies, and people who benefit from information they steal.\n\nBut retaliating economically against China could pose its own set of problems.\n\n\u201cThe real question is a strategic one,\u201d Zachary Goldman, a sanctions expert and a former senior official in the Treasury Department, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThe U.S. government has worked hard to cultivate a norm against commercially-motivated cyber espionage.\u201d State-on-state digital spying, however, is largely considered part of the global espionage game. \u201cIf this hack was motivated by reasons of state, we still might find it objectionable, and might indeed retaliate in ways that are outside the public eye. But we might not want to vocally argue that this kind of espionage should never take place.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials have previously said that they don\u2019t rule out imposing sanctions against those responsible for the OPM hack. But retaliating economically against China could pose its own set of problems.\n\nIndeed, the nation\u2019s top intelligence official, who said China was \u201cthe leading suspect\u201d in the OPM hack, has doffed his hat to the country\u2019s cyber spies for exploiting such a valuable and obvious target.\n\n\u201cYou have to kind of salute the Chinese for what they did,\" Clapper told an intelligence conference, adding the U.S. would have hacked them the same way if it could. There\u2019s an obvious hypocrisy in sanctioning China for an intelligence operation that the top American spy has said he\u2019d like to mount.\n\nClapper\u2019s remarks aren\u2019t an official statement of the administration's position. When asked if China was in fact responsible for the personnel records hack, spokespersons for the National Security Council, the FBI, and the OPM all said they weren\u2019t ready to identify a culprit.\n\nSo far, the only hard line the administration has taken publicly with China over its cyber spying is the indictment of five Chinese military officers in 2014 for hacking into U.S. corporations and stealing proprietary information. In that case, Justice Department officials said the Chinese had crossed a line, stealing trade secrets and pricing data from American companies and giving it to their Chinese competitors. That\u2019s one kind of spying that intelligence officials insist the U.S. doesn\u2019t do.\n\nSimilarly, the Obama administration justified retaliations against North Korea by describing the Sony hack as outside the bounds of traditional espionage. The regime purportedly attacked Sony in part to dissuade the movie studio from releasing a satirical film about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\u201cWe cannot have a society in which some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States,\u201d Obama said at the time, adding, \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are.

I think the timing of this indictment is highly suspicious given the fact that the first primary debate is tomorrow,\u201d Paul said in a statement.\n\nPaul the elder also offered his Thoughts and Prayers to those affected by the indictment. Asked if he knew of the payments to Sorenson, a spokesman for Paul did not respond.\n\nBenton\u2019s lawyer, Roscoe C. Howard Jr., echoed Ron Paul\u2019s belief that the indictment is part of a conspiracy.\n\n\u201cThat this indictment is now suddenly announced on the eve of the first Republican Presidential debate strongly supports our belief that this is a politically motivated prosecution designed to serve a political agenda, not to achieve justice,\u201d Howard said. \u201cMr. Benton is eager to get before an impartial judge and jury who will quickly recognize this for what he believes it is: Character assassination for political gain.\u201d\n\nThis is a stupid theory for a few reasons but mostly because the case is being prosecuted under the nonpartisan Public Integrity Section, which was assembled in the aftermath of Watergate. It is responsible for everything from Abscam to the criminal charges against former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, a Republican, and current United States Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat.\n\nThe conspiracy theories do not specify why anyone would think Rand Paul, who is polling at 6 percent, is enough of a threat that they would need to manufacture a criminal case against one of his associates in order to take him out at the knees.\n\nKentucky State Representative Mike Harmon told Politico that he spoke with Benton after the indictment came down, and Benton assured him he still had the presidential candidate\u2019s support.\n\n\u201cHe said Rand is standing with him and some of his other clients would be standing with him,\u201d Harmon told the publication.\n\nSince Benton does not work for the campaign, but is merely affiliated with it through the Super PAC, they cannot technically fire him. Benton\u2019s mailbox was full when I called. He did not respond to a text message asking if he would step down.\n\nBenton had been expected to play a prominent role on Rand Paul\u2019s presidential campaign. He had served as his campaign manager for his 2010 Senate race, helping him to defeat the establishment GOP favorite, and Mitch McConnell protege, Trey Grayson. McConnell seemed to think the defeat signaled a changing of the tides in the Kentucky GOP, because in 2013, he hired Benton to run his own campaign. Benton took the job, according to a leaked recording, to benefit Rand Paul, who needs the establishment GOP to win the primary. On the recording, Benton could be heard saying he was \u201choldin\u2019 my nose\u201d while working with McConnell, \u201cbecause what we\u2019re doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand in \u201916, so that\u2019s my long vision.\u201d\n\nIt didn\u2019t quite work out that way, of course. When Sorenson was indicted last year, Benton was forced to step down as McConnell\u2019s campaign manager\u2014a move which suggested the future might be bleak for him, too.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:45.361+0000"}

But a less-publicized case on Arizona\u2019s independent redistricting commission had those of us fighting for election reform holding our breath in the march toward the last day of decisions.\n\nAt stake was nothing less than the ability to fight back against the forces of polarization, paralysis, and hyper-partisanship in our politics. Out of 435 House seats, only 35 are considered competitive, and the rigged system of redistricting is to blame. It\u2019s a process of collusion between the two parties that takes place every 10 years in state legislatures and draws the congressional district lines\u2014a subversion of democracy where politicians pick their people rather than people picking their politicians.\n\nThe result is a screwed up incentive system where members of Congress are virtually guaranteed re-election as long as they don\u2019t lose a low turnout partisan primary, which means they live in fear of offending the base rather than reaching across the aisle to solve problems.\n\nIncreasingly, the remedy for this corrupt status quo has been voters bypassing the state legislators with ballot referendums that create independent redistricting commissions. California has done it to great effect, dislodging 14 incumbents who decided to retire after the independent commission promised to make their re-elections less than rubber-stamped.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what Arizonans did in advance of the 2010 districting, which upset then-Governor Jan Brewer. First she tried to remove the independent commission\u2019s chairwoman, Colleen Mathis, in a power grab that was overruled. Then Brewer decided to take the commission to court, arguing that the panel\u2014composed of two Republicans, two Democrats, and one independent\u2014tried to \u201celevate \u2018competitiveness\u2019 over other goals.\u201d Seriously.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t anything more than Republicans trying to hold on to a majority in a state where they constitute less than a third of the voters,\u201d explained former Phoenix mayor Paul Johnson at the time. But still the baseless, desperate, cynical case wound its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nIf the court decided that the voters\u2019 attempt to impose a nonpartisan redistricting commission over the self-dealing of the Arizona state legislators was unconstitutional, the best mechanism citizens have to restore fairness to congressional mechanisms would have been removed.\n\nThe court concluded that Arizona voters sought to restore \u201cthe core principle of republican government,\u201d namely, \u201cthat the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nAs Stanford law professor Nate Persily, the author of the new book Solutions to Political Polarization in America, explained: \u201cNot only would many redistricting commissions, such as Arizona and California\u2019s, have been thrown out, but any state regulation of congressional elections that was passed by initiative would have been legally vulnerable. This would have cast doubt, for instance, on California\u2019s nonpartisan primary, Arizona\u2019s voter ID law, and any number of other laws regulating voter registration, campaign financing, and ballot technology.\u201d\n\nIt could have meant open season on election reforms of all kinds. But happily, by a narrow 5-4 vote, with Justice Anthony Kennedy serving in his role as the swing vote\u2014possibly aided here by his roots in California, which has seen evidence of success in election reform\u2014the Supreme Court decided to back the integrity of Arizona\u2019s independent redistricting commission.\n\nAs Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her majority decision (PDF): \u201cWe see no constitutional barrier to a State\u2019s empowerment of its people.\u201d She continued by pointing out that \u201c\u2018[P]artisan gerrymanders,\u2019 this Court has recognized, \u2018[are incompatible] with democratic principles\u2019\u201d and attested to the fact that reforms like independent redistricting commissions have resulted in \u201cdistricts both more competitive and more likely to survive legal challenge.\u201d Quoting founding fathers from Madison to Hamilton, the decision concluded that Arizona voters sought to restore \u201cthe core principle of republican government,\u201d namely, \u201cthat the voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around.\u201d\n\nThe decision is a big win for election reform and a defeat for those professional partisan forces that want to keep the rigged system of redistricting in place. Now the prospect for future nonpartisan election reforms remains open and inviting to more citizens who understand that when you change the rules, you change the game.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:45.597+0000"}

Exactly how they like it.\n\nHOPE, Arkansas \u2014 Republican Mike Huckabee launched his second presidential campaign on Tuesday with the hometown gentility of John Mellencamp Americana and the fire and brimstone of the Book of Revelation.\n\nThe same town gave Clinton his successful 1992 campaign slogan \u201cI Still Believe In A Place Called Hope,\u201d now was setting of a new presidential campaign, new slogans and a new presidential aspirant with big dreams and little chance of ever making it to the White House.\n\nAdopting a play from the Clinton campaign handbook, Huckabee used the slogan Hope to Higher Ground to woo the crowd and charm the town where the National Park Service runs Clinton\u2019s boyhood home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long way from a little brick rent house on 2nd street in Hope, Arkansas, to the White House,\u201d Huckbee, who served as Arkansas\u2019 governor for 10 years, said at the start of his speech. \u201cBut here in this small town called Hope, I was raised to believe that where a person started didn\u2019t mean that\u2019s where he had to stop. I always believed a kid could go from Hope to Higher Ground.\u201d\n\nAs Huck waxed nostalgic for the ideal place where he learned to ride a bike, shoot a gun, learn Bible verses and get baptized\u2014something darker was looming.\n\nBecause, in years since Huckabee learned the Pledge of Allegiance, the Lord\u2019s Prayer and the Preamble to the Constitution in grade school and met his wife of 41 years, Janet \u2026 that place had disappeared.\n\nShifting from a message of Hope, Huckabee transformed into his former Baptist preacher persona to pump up the God-fearing conservative crowd with a fire-and-brimstone sermon about what\u2019s wrong with Washington and the world.\n\nAnd the world is really a scary place.\n\n\u201cEight years ago, a young, untested, inexperienced, and virtually unknown freshman Senator made great speeches about Hope and Change,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhen I hear the current president say he wants Christians to get off their high horse so we can make nice with radical jihadists, I wonder if he could watch a western from the fifties and be able to figure out who the good guys and bad guys are,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nNot only is President Obama part of the country\u2019s problem so are Washington fat cats who have made politicians their slaves, the IRS\u2014Huckabee is a supporter of the Fair Tax movement\u2014and big government in general. And that includes Congress.\n\n\u201cHow can anyone ever trust government again if they steal from us and lie to us?\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nThe former radio host had a bevy of one-line zingers about the state of affairs.\n\n\u201cGovernment in Washington is dysfunctional because it\u2019s become the roach motel\u2014people go in, but they never come out,\u201d he said.\n\nAnother one that the crowd loved?\n\n\u201cThe Supreme Court is not the Supreme Being, and they can\u2019t overturn the laws of nature or of nature\u2019s God.\u201d\n\nAfter all, this is what Huckabee fans have come to expect. He written several books filled with humor and folksy titles such as Quit Digging Your Grave With A Knife And Fork and, in a somewhat opposite take, God, Guns, Grits, and Gravy.\n\nSince he was in Arkansas, Huckabee, of course, had to take a swipe or two at the Clintons. Unlike other Republican presidential candidates, Huckabee has an ace in the hole when it comes to the Clintons. He\u2019s already taken Bill Clinton\u2019s good \u2018ol boy Arkansas\u2014and won.\n\n\u201cI governed in a state that was the most lopsided and partisan in the country\u2014no Republican governor had more Democrats and fewer Republicans,\u201d he said. \u201cI challenged the deeply entrenched political machine that ran this state.

But the way he tried to fix it made it less offensive (kinda) but still pretty weird.\n\nRemember that time when Governor Jeb Bush allowed a bill to become law that required unwed, pregnant women to publish their sexual history in the newspaper in order to give their babies up for adoption?\n\nNo? Well, it happened.\n\nBut this was just the beginning of the weird parental follies of Florida in the early 2000s.\n\nIn 2001, Bush didn\u2019t veto adoption-overhaul legislation that included a provision making it harder for unwed mothers to put their children up for adoption, as The Huffington Post recently reported .\n\nAnd by taking a pass, he allowed a particularly offensive provision to become law.\n\nThis provision required any woman who wanted to put her child up for adoption, but who didn\u2019t know who the father was, to take out an ad in a local newspaper listing her name and description, as well as the name and description of each possible father and the locations where the baby could have been conceived.\n\nIn other words, women had to broadcast her sexual histories to, well, pretty much everybody before attempting to find stable homes for her children.\n\nThe law\u2019s sponsor, state Senator Walter Campbell, said the provision was designed to keep \u201cpotential biological fathers from coming back and taking children out of adoptive parents\u2019 hands.\u201d And the law didn\u2019t include an exception for women who became pregnant because of rape.\n\n\u201cYou cannot just allow someone to say they were raped and use that as an excuse not to provide a name,\u201d said Deborah Marks , who helped draft the law, at the time.\n\nAlvin Coen, a veteran adoption lawyer, told the New Pittsburgh Courier at the time that concerns about birth fathers interfering with adoptions were baseless.\n\nThe bill passed overwhelmingly in the state House and by a 30-8 vote in the state Senate. Bush said he decided not to veto it because Campbell told him the newspaper-reporting language would get fixed. That didn\u2019t happen. What did happen? More abortions. The Orlando Sentinel reported there were almost 2,000 more abortions in the first six months of 2002\u2014after the legislation went into effect\u2014than in the first six months of 2001.\n\nAfter state courts declared the law unconstitutional, Bush signed legislation repealing it. The bill that took its place put the fathers-rights onus on potential fathers. The law still exists today.\n\n\u201cIn place of the publication requirement, the new law establishes a \u2018\u2019father registry\u2019 through which men who believe they may be fathers must provide the name, address, and physical description of the mother and the date and place where conception took place to protect their parental rights,\u201d The New York Times reported .\n\nThis wasn\u2019t the only time children\u2019s issues have gotten the former governor in trouble.

I am his lawyer. But I don\u2019t support this,\u201d said John Morgan, a Florida attorney and major Democratic donor who recently hosted Hillary Clinton at his home for a fundraiser. National Republicans, he added, \u201cwant Alan Grayson as our nominee so that they have something else to use against Hillary.\u201d\n\nWhat has Hillaryland worried? Well, consider some of Grayson\u2019s bon mots over the years: There was the time he summarized the GOP\u2019s health care plan as \u201cdie quickly.\u201d The time he called a female adviser to Ben Bernake \u201ca K Street whore.\u201d The time he accused Republicans of \u201clegislative terrorism.\u201d\n\nThen there is the messy divorce he is going through, complete with allegations of bigamy and domestic violence. (\u201cGold diggers gotta dig,\u201d he said recently when asked about his estranged wife.) Or the hedge funds he operates out of the Cayman Islands, which, when revealed by a Tampa Bay Times reporter, led Grayson to immediately drop perhaps his best Graysonism to date: \u201cAre you some kind of shitting robot?\u201d he asked the reporter.\n\n\u201cIf he becomes the nominee, you can bet that by the time he gets up on stage at a rally Hillary Clinton is going to be in her motorcade as far from there as you can be.\u201d\n\nMost of the Democratic establishment in Florida and in Washington, D.C., has lined up behind Representative Patrick Murphy, a 32-year-old former accountant (and former Republican) whose sober profile Democrats believe give them a better shot in this swingiest of swing states. Early polls have given leads to both candidates, and while most Florida politicos say that Grayson remains a slight underdog, they caution that he can raise a boatload of money from progressive activists, and can partially at least self-fund. (Grayson has an estimated wealth of $25 million.)\n\nTypically, it is the top of the ticket that impacts how the down-ballot candidates perform, but the fear among Hillary supporters is that Grayson could become their own Todd Akin. Back in 2012, the Missouri Senate candidate said that women can\u2019t get pregnant from \u201clegitimate rape,\u201d and Democrats tagged Mitt Romney with the comments at every opportunity.\n\nAs some Republican stalwarts pushed to get Akin removed from the ballot, Tea Party conservatives rallied behind him. Akin lost, and so, of course, did Romney, even though Romney condemned Akin\u2019s remarks and largely ignored his candidacy.\n\nIf Grayson goes Full-Grayson, however, and then goes on to emerge as the Democratic nominee in Florida, Clinton will have no such luxury. Florida is a must-win state for the GOP, and so Democrats are expected to invest heavily there. And this means a lot of rallies headlined by Hillary Clinton.\n\nWill she stand shoulder-to-shoulder with someone who compared the Tea Party to the KKK and the Republican Party to terrorists? If she does so, Republicans have a ready-made attack ad. If she doesn\u2019t, she risks angering the progressive base that rallied behind Grayson, who did not return a request for comment for this story.\n\n\u201cAlan is a loose cannon with a big ego who craves a microphone, and unfortunately, when he finds one, has a propensity to say crazy shit,\u201d said Ben Pollara, a Democratic fundraiser who led Hillary Clinton\u2019s Florida finance operation in 2008. \u201cIf he becomes the nominee, you can bet that by the time he gets up on stage at a rally Hillary Clinton is going to be in her motorcade as far from there as you can be.\u201d\n\nPollara and other Florida Dems pointed out, however, that it could be a lot harder to Graysonize Clinton as it was to Akinize Romney. She is, after all, one of the best-known political figures on the planet, one who was has weathered more scandals and gaffes then most politicians face in a lifetime. Can a few stray shitting robots really bring her down? Or, perhaps, Grayson could wind up toning down some of his histrionics, considering the White House could be at stake.\n\nOr perhaps not.\n\n\u201cAlan is going to be Alan,\u201d said Bob Poe, who is also raising money for Hillary. \u201cIf he turns out to be a loose cannon he wouldn\u2019t be able to make it out of the primary.

Same goes for the Democratic presidential race if a well-funded challenger to Hillary Clinton emerges.\n\nBoth Mike Huckabee and Jeb Bush wants us to believe, though, that they are better than that and would not stoop to such tactics to win the GOP presidential nomination. These two holier-than-thou guys (especially Huckabee) want to be seen as the living, breathing manifestation of Ronald Reagan\u2019s famous 11th Commandment: \u201cthou shalt not speak ill of another Republican.\u201d (FYI Reagan didn\u2019t actually coin that expression, it was first formulated by the chair of the Republican Party in California in 1965, by why let facts get in the way of canonizing Reagan, right? )\n\nFirst there was Bush, who last week promised that he would not attack his fellow Republicans during the GOP primaries, noting that, \"tearing down other people won't help at all.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd then came Huckabee. While campaigning over the weekend in New Hampshire, the former pastor urged his fellow GOP candidates to not engage in a Cain versus Abel type \u201cfratricide.\u201d He then preached to his fellow GOPers to avoid a \u201cfree for all\u201d and \u201cdemolition derby\u201d among each other.\n\n\n\nI have to give it up for both of them. Not for their sentiment. But given their own respective track records of ripping apart their Republican competitors in primaries that they were able to keep a straight face while making these statements.\n\nWhen Huckabee says a person should turn the other cheek, apparently it\u2019s so he can slap both sides.\n\nLet\u2019s look at the history of these two. Bush\u2019s last contested GOP primary was in 1994 when he was running for governor of Florida as part of a crowded field of candidates. Bush, along with the other top-tier Republicans entries, entered into a \u201cClean Campaign Pledge\u201d promising no personal attacks, just policy-based ones.\n\nSo there\u2019s Bush a month before the September 1994 primary with a sizable lead over the pack. But then Bush \u201cstunned\u201d his fellow Republicans, as The New York Times noted at the time, by unleashing negative campaign ads on his top two GOP rivals. These ads alleged in part that the two other Republicans wanted to raise taxes- a claim they both vehemently disputed. (If you run an ad distorting the policy position of your opponents, you are in essence launching a personal attack\u2014especially over taxes in a Southern GOP primary!)\n\n\n\nAnd then in a sheer display of unabashed elitism, the Bush ad stated that his two opponents \u201care taking millions of your tax dollars to pay for their political campaigns.\u201d The ad bragged that Bush wasn\u2019t.\n\nTechnically Bush was correct: His opponents were taking public financing, and he wasn\u2019t. Why? Well, because Bush was wealthy enough to bankroll his own campaign unlike his rivals.\n\nBut these attacks pale in comparison to Huckabee, who is expected to announce his presidential run on May 5. When Huckabee says a person should turn the other cheek, apparently it\u2019s so he can slap both sides.\n\nDuring Huckabee\u2019s 2008 presidential run, he unloaded a barrage of attacks on his GOP rivals; I\u2019m talking Old Testament, wrath of God stuff. For example a day before the 2008 New Hampshire primary, Huckabee mocked Mitt Romney for being wealthy, saying, \u201cI can\u2019t write a personal check for tens of millions of dollars to impress you with what a great guy I am.\u201d Huckabee then ridiculed Romney for not knowing how to clean a gun.\n\nAnd in the days before the Iowa caucus, Huckabee, reminiscent of what he\u2019s saying now, tried to remain above the fray by holding a press conference to announce he would not run a campaign ad that called Romney \u201cdishonest.\u201d Of course, Huckabee knew by holding a press event it would still get the barb out there anyway.\n\nBut worse, the Huckabee campaign then aired that very ad at least 10 times in various Iowa TV markets after publicly promising not to. When Huckabee\u2019s campaign was asked why, the response was, \u201cthe campaign gave their best effort to pull the ad. Perhaps they held a prayer circle and asked God to keep the ads off the air because a simple phone call to the TV stations would have presumably done the trick.\n\nAnd after John McCain beat Huckabee in the South Carolina primary, Huckabee stood next to his pal Chuck Norris as Norris alleged that McCain was too old to be president. I may not be an expert on Jesus like Huckabee, but I\u2019m pretty sure I know what Jesus would not do, and that\u2019s let Chuck Norris do his dirty work for him.\n\nLook, there\u2019s no need for Bush and Huckabee to insult our intelligence by pretending to better than they are on the issue of negative campaigning. We all know this will be a vicious, bare knuckles brawl to the GOP nomination. And given Bush and Huckabees\u2019 own history of attacking fellow Republicans, the question is not: Will there be blood? The only question is: How much Republican blood will they spill?", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:47.290+0000"}

{"entityId": 1815, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The movement is looking for a candidate who intuitively understands the struggles facing black Americans. And so far, Clinton is coming up short.\n\nOver the weekend, Black Lives Matter activists were able to navigate through a phalanx of Secret Service officers to have a backstage, one-on-one conversation with Hillary Clinton about the pertinent issues of the movement. And what they encountered was a bureaucrat in peak form who was more comfortable highlighting problems than proposing her own solutions.\n\nIn the first video, Julius Jones of BLM implores Clinton to explain how she has evolved on issues of race since the 1990s when she supported policies that have led to the mass incarceration of African Americans. \u201cHow do you actually feel that is different than before?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd what were those mistakes, and how can those mistakes that you\u2019ve made be lessons for all Americans for a moment of reflection on how we treat black people in this country?\u201d\n\nA Clinton staffer then politely interjected that they were already running short on time, and that throngs of other groups were also waiting to speak with the candidate. This did not go over well, and projected a dismissive perspective of the BLM movement before Clinton had a chance to respond. Regardless of whether this was the intent, it\u2019s indicative of a larger problem, which Clinton\u2019s response further highlighted.\n\nClinton\u2019s stuck to the standard political, unemotional answers that referenced her commitment to civil rights issues and to the concerns of the needy and children. Next she briefly, and uncomfortably, touched upon America\u2019s \u201coriginal sin\u201d without ever saying slavery, racial oppression, or the near destruction of Native American civilization. Then she transitioned straight into the realities of electoral politics: \u201cI\u2019m trying to put together in a way that I can explain it and I can sell it, because in politics if you can\u2019t explain it and you can\u2019t sell it, it stays on the shelf.\u201d\n\nClinton flubbed the question because all the members of the BLM movement wanted was to learn a bit more about her as a person. We wanted more than a staid political response. We wanted an eve of the 2008 New Hampshire primary moment, when she had tears in her eyes and finally showed some emotion. We wanted a glimmer of Hillary the human, and at this point BLM has received none of that.\n\nYet the remainder of the video still displayed an interesting perspective on an aspect of her personality and method of governing.\n\nShe eventually twisted the question into a request for the BLM movement to become more organized, so that it can champion a specific issue, which she can get behind, much like previous civil rights movements.\n\nLater in the video, the BLM activists responded to her assertion that they needed to become more organized, and a tense exchange unfurled. As I highlighted in a previous piece, the need to organize is already a known cause for concern within this movement, so having a presidential candidate respond to a question about her perspectives on race by highlighting the known flaws of your movement was always going to be troublesome.\n\nYet the most enlightening aspect of this exchange is how Clinton occupies the position of someone more focused on brokering deals and selling plans than someone capable of creating a solution or in touch with the lives of black Americans.\n\nShe needs the BLM movement to come together, so that they can create a plan, which she can sell to the American people. A decade ago, this position would have been adequate, but in this era it is not.\n\nPresident Obama is a black president who innately understands the reality and issues facing the black community, and this is the standard that African Americans now expect from Democratic presidential candidates.\n\nPrior to the election of Barack Obama, the best a black movement could do was internally express grievances, create a unifying body, and express these concerns to a white audience and hope that they gained support.\n\nAccess to power for black lives was so limited that the only opportunity for positive change was an organized assault on the minds of white Americans.\n\nThis is no longer the case. America has a black president. He understands the plight of black lives. He sees himself in Trayvon Martin: \u201cYou know, when Trayvon Martin was first shot I said that this could have been my son. Another way of saying that is Trayvon Martin could have been me 35 years ago.\u201d He spoke about the complexities of race during his first campaign. He has frequently spoken about the unfairness of our criminal justice system. He has appointed two African-American attorneys general. He is the first president to visit a prison. The list goes on and on.\n\nPresident Obama is a black president who innately understands the reality and issues facing the black community, and this is the standard that African Americans now expect from Democratic presidential candidates. Of course, we cannot determine the race of presidential hopefuls, but we can vet them to see if they understand the realities of black life in America.\n\nPreviously, the expectation was for Democratic presidents to listen to our voices. We did not expect them to be one of us or to initially understand us. We hoped that through discourse we might be able to convince them that our perspectives had merit. Prominent African Americans ranging from Martin Luther King Jr., Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton, Cornel West, and Tavis Smiley were regularly beckoned to the White House to counsel previous presidents, but a change has now emerged. BLM is showing that black Americans expect presidential candidates to understand the issues that matter most to us if they want our support.\n\nPresidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley have already come under fire for appearing to not understand the black community. Discussing issues involving race along economic and income inequality lines is no longer adequate, even if these proposed policies would improve black lives.\n\nSanders learned this the hard way, and in response he has presented a platform on racial justice and appointed an African-American woman as his campaign\u2019s national press secretary. Candidates can no longer dismiss \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and proclaim \u201cAll Lives Matter\u201d because this overlooks America\u2019s original sins and professes a false narrative of racial equality in America. O\u2019Malley has learned this the hard way too.\n\nBill Clinton was once lauded as America\u2019s first black president because African Americans felt that he related to us, and that we would receive a seat at his table. Now, we are not only expecting a seat at the table, but also that the candidates already understand our perspectives and the issues that matter the most to us.\n\nWe need to be an integral part of the political process, and this cannot be dismissed. Sitting on the outside, and waiting for our turn or the eventual ear of the president, is no longer acceptable. Candidate Clinton needs to learn that we will no longer settle for a seat at her table when she decides that we are organized enough.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:47.802+0000"}

He hasn\u2019t changed\u2014but the Republican Party sure has.\n\nDon\u2019t expect James A. Baker 3d to be tapped for another stint at Foggy Bottom. On Monday night, at J Street\u2019s fifth annual conference, Baker lit into Benjamin Netanyahu and his newly elected, Likud-led government. Never one to mince words, Baker told the crowd, \u201cFrankly, I have been disappointed with the lack of progress regarding a lasting peace\u2014and I have been for some time\u2026 in the aftermath of Netanyahu\u2019s recent election victory, the chance of a two-state solution seems even slimmer, given his reversal on the issue.\u201d\n\nTart as that message might have been, the 84-year-old Baker had gone there before. Baker, who served as George H.W. Bush\u2019s secretary of state, as Ronald Reagan\u2019s treasury secretary, and as White House chief of staff to both Presidents, had laid down a similar line in May 1989 to an earlier Likud prime minister. In a speech to AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, Baker told the folks in the room and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzchak Shamir to \u201clay aside once and for all the unrealistic vision of a greater Israel\u2026 reach out to Palestinians as neighbors who deserve political rights.\u201d\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Baker\u2019s J Street Speech sounded like a stroll down memory lane, and it could have even been delivered by Denis McDonough, the Obama White House chief of staff\u2014and indeed, it was. Earlier on Monday, and also before J Street, McDonough warned Israel against annexing the West Bank, and similarly upbraided Netanyahu for being Netanyahu.\n\nStill, one place, however, where Baker\u2019s words were unwelcome is the current iteration of the Republican Party. As conservative talk radio-host Mark Levin put it, \u201cJim Baker, much like Barack Obama, has always had a hate on for Israel.\u201d Wow. Levin had lumped Baker in with Rev. Jeremiah Wright\u2019s most famous congregant.\n\nSince Baker\u2019s forced retirement in 1993 at the hands of Bill Clinton, both America and the GOP have changed. The Republican Party has increasingly become an assembly of White America at Worship, an America that vividly and painfully remembers 9/11, and for whom Islam and ISIS spell a real and personalized threat and challenge. In 2012, Evangelicals comprised just over half of all Republican primary voters in contested states, and their views predominate.\n\nIn other words, the Republican Party is no longer the party of a WASP Establishment, just as Mainline Protestantism no longer defines the American religious mainstream. And Baker\u2019s view on the two-state solution is a casualty.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not just about demographics. The fact that Baker\u2019s take on the Middle East lacks a natural home within the GOP is not mere happenstance, and Baker himself had had a hand in that, however unintentionally.\n\nIn case anybody forgot, it was Baker who reportedly mouthed off \u201cScrew the Jews. They don\u2019t vote for us anyway,\u201d and on a certain level Baker got it right. Taking Baker\u2019s words to heart, Jewish voters stuck it to Bush and Baker. In 1992, Bush won just 11 percent of the Jewish vote, down from 35 percent just four years earlier.\n\nIt was Baker who reportedly mouthed off \u201cScrew the Jews. They don\u2019t vote for us anyway,\u201d and on a certain level Baker got it right.\n\nEnter the neoconservatives, who were alarmed by Baker, but who were also disturbed by the Democrats social liberalism, and disgusted by the Ghost of George McGovern. According to The Weekly Standard\u2019s William Kristol, \u201cthe big story in the Republican Party over the last 30 years\u2026 is first the eclipsing of I\u2019d say the [George H.W.] Bush [Brent] Scowcroft [James] Baker traditional\u2014it\u2019s unfair to say\u2014 hostility to Israel\u2014 but lack of closeness and warmth for Israel.\u201d Feeling Israel in one\u2019s kishkes is now another requirement for seeking the Republican presidential nod, at least according to Kristol.\n\nIn Kristol\u2019s view, the GOP of yore \u201cwas an Arabist, old-fashioned Republican Party, which was certainly very concerned about relations with Arab states that were not friendly with Israel and skeptical about the case for Israel.\u201d Kristol, however, neglects to mention that it was also a Republican Party that knew how to exercise power, while also understanding its limits.\n\nBush 41 successfully assembled a true coalition of the willing, drove Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, knew when to say when, and actually won a war. Apparently, all minor details to Kristol.\n\nBut the decline of Bakerism is as much about Mammon as it is about God. As the Times of Israel reported in 2012, \u201cthe biggest donor to Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign, and the two biggest donors to Barack Obama\u2019s reelection bid, are all Jewish,\u201d with by far the biggest donor being Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas-based casino mogul.\n\nWhere Adelson\u2019s sentiments lie are no secret. His Israeli daily, Israel Hayom, is a Netanyahu mouthpiece. Adelson has advocated that America nuke Iran and downplayed the role that democracy needs to play within Israeli political life. According to Adelson, \u201cI don\u2019t think the Bible says anything about democracy\u2026 God didn\u2019t talk about Israel remaining as a democratic state\u2026 Israel isn\u2019t going to be a democratic state\u2014so what?\u201d\n\nSo nothing. Notwithstanding all of this, Republican presidential hopefuls continue to make their pilgrimage to Adelson\u2014even libertarian-minded Rand Paul. And if Paul is acting like another Adelson supplicant, don\u2019t hold your breath waiting for Baker to be delivering the 2016 Republican keynote address, let alone being named secretary of state.\n\nJ Street, Sunday talk shows, his own hagiography, and Jeb\u2019s 2016 campaign are where it\u2019s at for Baker. He won\u2019t be going back into government, but also don\u2019t expect him to be ignored.

Edgar Hoover, and now such boldfaced names as Victoria\u2019s Secret model Adriana Lima, retired Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula, and singer Julio Iglesias and his son Enrique all own homes there.\n\nNow, 10 percent of the island has donated money to support Marco Rubio\u2019s political career. That\u2019s out of a total population of just 60 residents on the island over the age of 20, per the 2010 census. That\u2019s including the owners who are foreigners (making them ineligible to vote or donate).\n\nThe broader neighborhood is fundraising heaven: In the 2014 election cycle, its inhabitants gave $1.2 million, or 24 times more than an average ZIP Code. During Rubio\u2019s campaign for Senate, dozens in the ZIP Code gave thousands of dollars each to support him.\n\nThe most prominent Rubio supporter on the island is former Philadelphia Eagles owner Norman Braman, who the Miami Herald reported was prepared to spend $10 million in support of the senator\u2019s campaign for the White House. (Braman declined to confirm this, saying only that his contribution would be \u201cvery significant.\u201d) Braman\u2019s net worth is estimated at $1.89 billion.\n\nBraman shares Rubio\u2019s rags-to-riches story, a fact that no doubt endears the billionaire to the aspiring presidential candidate.\n\nIn interviews with The Daily Beast, he praised Rubio as \u201ca guy who is not full of himself. He\u2019s not overly impressed by having the title of senator in front of his name.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the island is filled with self-made men: either immigrants or the children of immigrants. Braman, a tycoon who launched a series of auto dealerships in Florida in the 1970s, is the son of a barber and a seamstress. Rubio often makes a point to highlight his parents\u2019 meager roots: his father\u2019s as a bartender, and his mother\u2019s as a maid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both from humble upbringings.

In 2012, after that year\u2019s successful Senate campaign, the FEC issued an $8,000 fine for excessive contributions totaling more than $210,000 and did not properly address it.\n\nRubio campaign spokesman Alex Conant told the Beast the campaign is taking care of the problem.\n\n\u201cWe take compliance seriously and fully understand the limits. We have reviewed our filings and responded to the FEC,\u201d he said.\n\nFlorida home construction magnate Itzhak Ezratti, an Israeli immigrant who has traveled with Florida Govs. Jeb Bush and Charlie Crist on delegations to Israel, gave Rubio $3,400 during his Senate campaign.

There\u2019s no Indian Creek activist group\u2026 it\u2019s not a sociable island in that sense.\u201d\n\nBut neither is the island asocial, Klepach said.\n\n\u201cEverybody knows each other here,\u201d the town\u2019s mayor told the Beast. \u201cI know pretty much everybody on the island, it\u2019s a small island.\u201d\n\n\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z sold their Indian Creek Village home in 2010, and neither has a history of political donations. And Braman estimates that 30 percent of the island\u2019s residents are foreign and can\u2019t even vote.\n\nHowever, the island\u2019s other American homeowners represent a ripe opportunity for Rubio to raise money. Many who own property on the island have given money to Republicans in the past, but not yet to him: investor Carl Icahn, worth more than $20 billion; mutual fund titan Charles Johnson, worth some $6.5 billion; hedge fund manager Edward Lampert, worth $3.2 billion. The list goes on.\n\nAt the center of the island is the exclusive Indian Creek Country Club, established in 1928. It features a $150,000 initiation fee and $16,000 in annual dues, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nIf Rubio wants to raise money one afternoon, maybe he could set up shop in the choosy, 300-member club. Paul \u201cMr. Tomato\u201d DiMare, the largest grower of fresh-market tomatoes in the U.S., is a known club member and has donated $7,900 to Rubio. Automobile dealer and club member Gus Machado, a Cuban emigre, has given $2,400.\n\nOne downside: The invitation-only country club has something of prejudiced political past.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nThe Orange Bowl Committee held its annual party at the club, which then allowed Jews and African Americans in only as guests, the Miami New Times reported. Under pressure, the committee found a new home for its party in 1986.\n\nIn 1999, former village mayor Leonard Miller, who is Jewish, refused to meet with Bill Clinton after the president golfed at the club. And former Governor Jeb Bush canceled plans to golf there in 2000 after speaking with Miller.\n\nAsked Wednesday about whether there was a discriminatory admittance policy at the club, club general manager Leon Crimmins said \u201cIt\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nIn any case, donations from the ultra-wealthy could be crucial for the Rubio campaign\u2019s longevity\u2014just ask Newt Gingrich, whose 2012 campaign was given a boost through the millions donated by Sheldon Adelson, or Rick Santorum, who benefitted from millions in donations from businessman Foster Friess.\n\nThe Rubio campaign is not prepared to tip its hand about where it will seek out donors. Asked if they planned to rely on big-dollar donors, as opposed to grassroots activists, spokesman Conant replied, \u201cWe do not discuss fundraising strategy.\u201d\n\nThe island is a locus of self-made millionaires and billionaires, many of whom have sympathy for Rubio personally and his party more broadly. And he already has a big booster there in Braman\u2014so it might be a good place to start.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio is a candidate for the future,\u201d Braman said. \u201cHe can lead the country forward, [he] can get things done.

{"entityId": 1819, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "No one is invincible. If Republicans are smart about reaching out to young people and black voters, they can move back in to 1600.\n\nAssuming Hillary Clinton becomes the Democratic nominee for president, I offer you something that will defy conventional wisdom at first but will provide Republicans a significant opportunity to win next November if they play their cards right. There is a narrative in the media that Clinton is nearly invincible\u2014in fact some Republicans even want her to win! Consider the following exchange on MSNBC this week with veteran reporter Andrea Mitchell. Mitchell apparently has her finger on the pulse of Republican women, and she made this stunning declaration: There are many Republican women who secretly want to vote for Clinton and would do so without telling their husbands once they were safely inside the voting booth.\n\nOn air, Mitchell said: \u201cYou hear more and more anecdotally\u2026I know you do, I do from Republican suburban women who may not even tell their spouses or partners, but you hear of this longing for a woman in the Oval Office\u2026there really is a secret hidden vote there [for Clinton].\u201d\n\nI won\u2019t speculate about the social circles Mitchell hangs out with in her spare time, but I socialize with many Republicans, and I\u2019ve never had a wife tell me she secretly longed for Hillary to be in the Oval Office but wouldn\u2019t tell their husband of their intent to vote for her. Of course, I\u2019m a man, so I realize they might not tell me, at least if Mitchell\u2019s theory is right. Nevertheless, over the last few days I reached out to several prominent Republican women in media and politics to read them Mitchell\u2019s statement. I found the following illuminating.\n\nOne prominent woman in media told me: \u201cI would never, and know not one single female associate, friend or family member, who would vote for a female candidate based on their gender; whether it\u2019s Carly Fiorina, Hillary Clinton, Nikki Haley, or Elizabeth Warren. That is a sexist mindset, period.\u201d\n\nContinuing this line of thinking, a former colleague and fellow special assistant to George W. Bush offered: \u201cWhy would we vote for a woman just because she\u2019s a woman? The candidate\u2019s policy positions and record are far more important. That is as offensive as suggesting that you should have voted for President Obama only because he\u2019s black.\u201d\n\nIf there is a secret Republican women\u2019s vote that will help steer Secretary Clinton to the Oval Office, I\u2019m unaware of it. What I am aware of, however, is a significant chink in Clinton\u2019s armor of invincibility both to her nomination as the Democratic standard bearer and her winning the presidency: blacks and younger millennials. If Republicans play their cards correctly and make meaningful inroads with these two groups, the GOP could shock the media and the Democratic establishment (often one and the same) by winning next November.\n\nFirst, the Republican presidential wannabees would be wise to keep their finger on the pulse of the 18-29 age demographic that helped sweep President Obama into office. Clinton\u2019s support there continues to sag. Twice a year, the Harvard University Kennedy School of Government Institute of Politics, where I was a 2011 Resident Fellow, conducts a comprehensive poll to survey the mood of this key group.\n\nIn the most recent survey conducted last fall, support for President Obama and his policies continue to wane while interest in Republicans controlling Congress increased significantly over a similar poll conducted in the fall of 2010. For example, more than half of those students preferred that Republicans run Congress by 51 to 47 percent. That\u2019s a big change from 2010, when Democratic control was preferred by a margin of 55 to 43 percent. Not hard to extrapolate that these numbers for congressional support for younger voters could be even more stark for Democrats next November.\n\nMore ominously for Clinton, the poll showed a marked enthusiasm among likely young conservative voters to head to the polls and a lack of enthusiasm by younger Democrats.\n\nI make this statement from a position of knowledge rather than drawing inferences from the polling data. The students I have been privileged to teach both at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics as well as Georgetown have expressed to me their displeasure with the direction the country is headed. They are interested in traditional issues that favor Democrats such as climate change, same-sex marriage, and pay equality, each of which Clinton supports.\n\nHowever, Republicans can seize upon the slight crack in the door Democrats have provided: My students are also quite concerned with the size of the federal debt as well as the sense that President Obama has over-reached with his use of executive orders.\n\nMore ominously for Clinton, the latest Institute of Politics poll showed a marked enthusiasm among likely young conservative voters to head to the polls and a lack of enthusiasm by younger Democrats. Republicans would be wise to capitalize on the opportunity to engage these younger voters via social media\u2014the Harvard survey found this to be the preferred method of communications, with popularity shown on such platforms as Facebook and Snapchat with white voters and strong popularity with Twitter and Instagram among blacks.\n\nThe GOP field would also be wise to court a group of voters Clinton is likely to take for granted: African Americans. Phillip Klein wrote an interesting piece this week in the Washington Examiner in which he asked whether Clinton can hold together the Obama coalition. Blacks represent a huge opportunity for either party\u2019s standard bearer. As Klein notes, \u201cBetween the time of Jimmy Carter\u2019s victory over Gerald Ford and John Kerry\u2019s loss to George W. Bush in 2004, Democrats won black votes by an average of nearly 75 points. But Obama won the group by 91 points in 2008 and 87 points in 2012.\u201d Let\u2019s cut to the chase: If Republicans make significant inroads in the black community, they are likely to win\u2014regardless of their Democratic opponent. I would suggest they look to Ohio Governor John Kasich (my former boss), who won 86 out of 88 counties in Ohio in his 2014 reelection and wrapped up nearly 30 percent of the black vote.\n\nFinally, let me address the invincibility factor of Clinton\u2019s candidacy. Yes, the electoral college map seems to favor the putative Democratic nominee at this point. But recent polling by Dr. Ron Faucheux from the Clarus Research Group should be sending warning bells to Clinton.\n\nIn polling data released last week, Clinton is either tied or behind a handful of her potential Republican challengers. In Colorado, Faucheux found Clinton and former Governor Mike Huckabee tied with 41 percent each, while Marco Rubio and Scott Walker were edging Clinton by one point.\n\nThe same basic point holds for Clinton in Iowa. The point is that in key states such as Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia\u2014states Clinton needs to win to head back to the White House\u2014her approval ratings are less than 50 percent across the board. Should Republicans win these states along with Ohio and Florida, I don\u2019t see a viable path for a Clinton victory.\n\nDespite the cheerleading in the media and academia thus far, Hillary Clinton can be beaten in her quest to return the Clintons to the White House. Actions speak louder than words, and the time is now for Republicans to actively court groups previously ceded to the Democrats as both sides look to carve out 270 electoral college votes to win the presidency. Will the Republicans fight for votes with people of color and younger voters to get it right this time? Only time can tell but the bloom is off the rose of Clinton\u2019s inevitable march to the presidency.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:48.841+0000"}

Lee and his Army of Northern Virginia surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House, and the great American Civil War ended, or so we\u2019ve read in high school textbooks and on Wikipedia.\n\nThe chivalrous Lee, in countless hues of grey on his white horse, and the magnanimous Grant in muddy boots were icons that the reunited-by-force United States needed desperately a century and a half ago, and that we\u2019ve cherished ever since.\n\nBut the war did not really end at Appomattox, just as it did not really begin four years before when South Carolina militias opened fire on the tiny Union garrison in the massive, unfinished fort called Sumter that dominated Charleston Harbor.\n\nAnd if we want to stop and think today about what that war was about\u2014what made it happen\u2014then cannons, shot and shells, mini\u00e9 balls, muskets and swords do not, in the end, tell us very much. Brave men were called on to fight for their homes and their ideals, or because they didn\u2019t have better sense, and, as in every war, they kept on fighting for their brothers in arms.\n\nIn the South, the spirit of camaraderie and defiance ran so hot and so deep that for generations afterwards, and to this day in some corners of the air-conditioned Sunbelt that was once the Confederacy, people will tell you about \u201cThe Lost Cause.\u201d\n\nBut, let\u2019s be clear. The cause of the South was not the cause of chivalry, nor was it about the revolutionary ideals of the Boston Tea Party, as many claimed at the time. \u201cThe tea has been thrown overboard; the revolution of 1860 has been initiated,\u201d declared Charleston\u2019s Robert Barnwell Rhett as the Carolinians prepared to secede from the Union and precipitate the war.\n\nRhett was one of the coterie of radicals in the South who came to be known as \u201cfire-eaters,\u201d and their cause was not the cause of freedom that the founding fathers fought for in the American Revolution. Their cause was slavery: holding slaves, working slaves, buying and selling slaves\u2014black chattel considered less than human beings by custom, by the courts, and even by the Constitution, whose authors never mentioned slavery but weasel-worded it into the founding document of the Union.\n\nAccording to the original U.S. Constitution, slaves, who had no rights whatsoever as citizens, would be counted as three-fifths of a person for the census that determined a state\u2019s representation in Congress. This constitutional right\u2014for such it was\u2014was not one the slave-holding states were willing to give up, because they feared if they lost their disproportionate power in Washington, eventually their \u201cright\u201d to own other human beings to clear their land, grow their crops, and make their fortunes for them would be challenged.\n\nThe cry of \u201cself-preservation\u201d in the face of the federal government was \u201calways on the lips of a Carolinian when he is about to justify an outrage connected with Slavery,\u201d wrote the British consul in Charleston in the 1850s.\n\nEvery so often, rumors of a \u201cservile insurrection\u201d stirred hysterical emotions and ruthless reprisals. One plot for a slave rebellion stoked by a \u201cfree person of color\u201d named Denmark Vesey was crushed before it even began in the 1820s, but 40 years later it still lingered like a nightmare and a prophecy in the minds of Southerners.\n\nThe notion that had existed in the early part of the century that the hideous \u201cpeculiar institution\u201d would somehow atrophy and disappear had itself evanesced. The cotton gin, a machine separating seeds from fiber that was invented at the end of the 18th century, had made a marginal crop into a source of enormous revenues. But the cotton economy of the South was hugely rapacious. It burned out old land so that new acreage constantly had to be opened, and that was the job of slaves.\n\nThe hunger for that fresh territory and the slaves to work it was insatiable. The annexation of Texas and the subsequent war that took a huge part of Mexico in 1848 was not enough to satisfy them, because not all that territory would be slave-owning. The South and its friends in the North (like President James Buchanan) wanted Cuba, too, and many Southerners supported efforts to invade and conquer and annex more of Mexico and much of Central America.\n\nMore land, more slaves, meant more money and more power to dominate the federal government and make it support people who wanted more land, more slaves and more money. And in the 1850s a movement grew that was best defined as \u201crule or ruin\u201d: if the slave-owning South could not control the federal government, then it would break away from it. The Union, as the famous headline in the Charleston Mercury declared in December 1860, would be \u201cdissolved.\u201d\n\nOne of the issues that the fire-eaters played on was the reopening of the slave trade with Africa that had been banned since 1808. (The Constitution had enshrined it up until that date.) By the mid-19th century, most Americans, including most Southerners, knew that the traffic had been horrific, and many understood that it was, in fact, a holocaust. It had continued to Cuba and Brazil, and stories often reached the American press of ships packed so tightly with human cargo that, as one horrified U.S. naval officer put it, there was \u201cscarcely space to die in.\u201d\n\nThe fire-eaters pushing for secession argued that this was not a crime at all. Slavery, as Mr. Rhett (the would-be heir to the Tea Party) put it, was \u201ca blessing to the African race and a system of labor appointed by God.\u201d Such men firmly believed that the world markets for the cotton that slaves produced\u2014especially the great military powers of Britain and France\u2014would put aside their moral qualms and support the South for the sake of its white gold.\n\nIn essence, they convinced themselves that King Cotton was the king of England. But that was not the case. The British government never did join the Confederates in their war with the Union. And without such support the agrarian Confederacy was all but doomed in its fight against the heavily industrialized and much more populous North. Only the genius of Robert E. Lee was able to keep the war going for as long as it went on.\n\nThe Ordinance of Secession and \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes\u201d drafted by South Carolina grandees in December 1860 were concerned entirely and exclusively with the question of slavery.\n\n\n\nThe Ordinance of Secession and \u201cDeclaration of the Immediate Causes\u201d drafted by South Carolina grandees intent not only on justifying their own state\u2019s withdrawal from the Union in December 1860, but on persuading the other slave-holding states to join it, was concerned entirely and exclusively with the question of slavery. It quoted the Constitution. It cited the Declaration of Independence. But it was not about all men being created equal. And it was not about tariffs, as some have argued since. And it was not merely about the general principle of states\u2019 rights. It was specifically about the states\u2019 rights to enshrine slavery, pure and simple\u2014and evil\u2014as that was, and the obligation of the federal government to guarantee the rights of human-property owners. Since the Feds weren\u2019t likely to do that under the new Lincoln administration in Washington, the Carolinians argued, \u201cself-preservation\u201d dictated secession. They were determined, come what may, to make their world safe for slavocracy.\n\nSo where did the Civil War begin and where did it end? One can pick many places, many times, but an illuminating version of the story can be built around one figure: a young red-haired fire-eater from Savannah, the heir to a huge banking and commercial fortune in the North as well as the South, named Charles Augustus Lafayette Lamar.\n\nIn 1858, Lamar backed the voyage of a sleek 118-foot yacht called the Wanderer that sailed to the coast of Africa, loaded 471 Negroes on board, according to contemporary accounts, and landed weeks later on Georgia\u2019s Jekyll Island. Roughly 370 Africans were offloaded there. The other 101 had died at sea: acceptable attrition when Negroes could be sold in the South for six, eight, ten times what they cost in the baracoons of West Africa. Their bodies had simply been thrown overboard. (\u201cThe shark of the Atlantic is still, as he has ever been, the partner of the slave trader,\u201d as one British editorialist put it.)\n\nLamar and his partners sent the Wanderer on its voyage not only to make money, but to flout the federal law. A whole generation of slave traders hauling their tortured cargo to Cuba under the American flag had proved, on the rare occasions when they were caught, that no U.S. court would convict them for what was supposed to be a capital crime. Indeed, Southern grand juries would not even indict them. And Lamar and his cronies proved that once again.\n\n\u201cThey are rather amused at the idea of embarrassing the Federal Government, and perhaps, in a lesser degree, of annoying Great Britain,\u201d the British consul in Charleston advised London in 1859, \u201cbut they will awake from their delusion.\u201d He predicted that the Democratic Party, which the slave interests had dominated, would be torn apart by the fire-eaters pushing for ever greater power, and the anti-slavery Republicans, the party of Abraham Lincoln, would come to power. \u201cWhen this shall happen, the days of Slavery are numbered,\u201d wrote the consul. \u201cThe prestige and power of Slave holders will be gone, never to return.\u201d\n\nAnd so it was. Lamar got what he had wished for. Most of the slave-holding states seceded from the Union, and they fought long and hard for their independence. Through much of that time, as a skilled organizer of blockade runners, Lamar not only survived but thrived. But as the Union troops of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman marched through Georgia in 1864, Lamar took up arms\u2014and he would not put them down.\n\nBy then, it should have been obvious to all that the war was over. So desperate had the Confederates become that they even started talking about emancipating the slaves if only Britain and France would, at long last, back them. But by 1864 it was far too late for that.\n\nOn April 9, 1865, Lee surrendered at Appomattox.\n\nOn April 14, 1865, Robert Anderson, who had surrendered Fort Sumter exactly four years before, raised the Union flag there once again in a ceremony intended to write a definitive end to the war. If he had had his wishes, he said, he would have done it in silence. In attendance were many former slaves who had enlisted as Union soldiers. One of the honored guests was the son of Denmark Vesey. But the event was forever overshadowed by the murder in Washington a few hours later of President Abraham Lincoln.\n\nStill, Lamar continued to fight, stubborn and defiant as ever.\n\nOn April 16, 1865, Union and Confederate troops clashed on the outskirts of Columbus, Georgia. There are several different accounts of how Lamar died. In one that circulated among his relatives he was trying to surrender when he was shot almost by accident. But the one preferred by Erik Colonius, whose 2006 book The Wanderer is essentially a biography of Lamar, is far more dramatic:\n\n\u201cIn a few minutes the fighting was hand to hand,\u201d Confederate soldier Pope Barrow recalled later. \u201cA Federal cavalryman, whose horse had been shot from under him, stepped in front of Black Cloud, the horse Col. Lamar was riding, seized the bit with his left hand, and threw up his carbine with his right, and called on Lamar to surrender. Quick as lightning, Lamar plunged his spurs into his horse\u2019s sides and tried to run over his opponent. At that instant\u2014as the horse reared and plunged above the soldier\u2014he fired, and at the crack of the carbine Lamar fell lifeless to the ground.\u201d\n\nAnd so, Charlie Lamar\u2019s war came to an end.\n\nBut there are times, and maybe today is one of those times, when one looks at the great questions of race and rights in the United States and realizes the spirit of the fire-eaters\u2014their rationalization of racism, their contempt for the federal government, their penchant for violence, their self-deluding vision of their place in the world, and their desire to impose their values on the majority\u2014all that, I am afraid, lives on.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:49.150+0000"}

May God continue to bless you.\u201d\n\nThe newly released emails also show a close monitoring of LGBT activists\u2019 frustration with the Obama administration\u2019s handling of gay marriage, an issue President Obama did not \u201cevolve\u201d on until 2012.\n\n\u201cFYI,\u201d Mills wrote on an email with the subject line \u201cMore Gay Donors Drop Out of DNC Fundraiser, Protesting Justice Department Brief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know she advanced things for LGBT State Department employees, but her impact was much greater in terms of setting a global policy agenda.\u201d\n\nThe article in the body of the email details the LGBT community\u2019s dissatisfaction with the Obama administration\u2019s position gay marriage\u2014in light of a Justice Department brief that defended the Defense of Marriage Act and was denounced by advocates as anti-gay marriage.\n\nOn May 4, 2009, Clinton was forwarded an email with the subject line \u201cIraqi Gays Face Gruesome Torture/ Murder Technique\u201d that detailed the brutal murders of gay men in Iraq.\n\n\u201cSo sad and terrible,\u201d Clinton wrote to Mills.\n\nShe then suggested that Chris Hill, then-ambassador to Iraq, raise it with the government.\n\nLater that year, Richard Socarides, a former special assistant to President Bill Clinton, sent Mills an article about a spate of anti-gay laws passed in East Africa.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of appreciation for everything the Dept has done around this so far and I think you could really build on it by putting someone there in charge of international LGBT human rights issues,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMills forwarded the email, and Hillary Clinton agreed that the idea had merit.\n\nDan Baer, who now serves as the U.S representative to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, eventually oversaw the international LGBT portfolio, but The Washington Blade noted that no envoy was officially appointed during Clinton\u2019s years at the State Department. Her successor, Secretary of State John Kerry, appointed Randy Berry as the special envoy for the human rights of LGBTI persons.\n\nOutside the State Department, though, Clinton was not always seen as a leader in the fight for gay rights. In June 2014 interview on NPR, she was asked about her evolution on gay marriage, after she embraced gay marriage in a 2013 video for the Human Rights Campaign. Her answer puzzled many advocates.\n\n\u201cSo, for me, marriage had always been a matter left to the states,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd in many of the conversations that I and my colleagues and supporters had, I fully endorse the efforts by activists who work state by state, and in fact that is what is working.\"\n\n\u201cI know her heart, but it is terrible framing,\u201d Hilary Rosen, an advocate for LGBT rights and Clinton ally, told The Huffington Post at the time. \u201cSince this is going to the Supreme Court potentially on that question, I was surprised at her \u2018old school\u2019 framing of that. Since she has \u2018evolved,\u2019 why not just get rid of that old red herring, too?\u201d\n\nStill, to those who worked and advocated at the State Department for LGBT rights, the moves in 2009 set the tone for a very pro-LGBT State Department.\n\n\u201cI know she advanced things for LGBT State Department employees, but her impact was much greater in terms of setting a global policy agenda,\u201d Socarides told The Daily Beast. \u201cWe have never had a champion before in this arena.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:49.438+0000"}

And how wrong is Bernie Sanders on health care?\n\nBy Lauren Carroll, Will Cabaniss, and Linda Qiu\n\nAfter weeks of news about his blunt statements, billionaire Republican candidate Donald Trump offered more specifics Sunday about what policies voters could expect from a Trump White House.\n\nNBC\u2019s Meet the Press moderator Chuck Todd questioned Trump in a lengthy sit-down interview about his ideas for immigration reform, legal exceptions for abortion, and whether he will, like some of his opponents, \u201crip up\u201d the Iran deal that lifts economic sanctions in exchange for the country not developing a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cThe problem is by the time I got in there, they will have already received the $150 billion,\u201d Trump said. \u201cDo you know if the deal gets rejected they still get the money? Which is something I found out a week ago. I couldn\u2019t believe it. If the deal gets rejected, they still get all of this money. Iran is going to be unbelievably powerful and unbelievably rich.\u201d\n\nHis claim that Iran will get $150 billion \u201ceven if the deal gets rejected\u201d rates Half True.\n\nThe $150 billion figure is on the high side of how much analysts expect Iran to receive in unlocked assets. Experts said the more common estimate is $100 billion, though the figure could run as low as $25 billion if the country\u2019s other financial obligations are taken into account, such as money Iran owes to China for infrastructure projects. The Obama administration has said that after Iran pays its outstanding financial obligations, it will have about $56 billion at its disposal.\n\nHowever, experts said Trump does have a point about what could happen if Congress rejects the deal and U.S. sanctions remain in place (surviving a presidential veto). Other countries in the United Nations and European Union could stop enforcing their own sanctions anyway, allowing Iran to access at least some of its assets that have been frozen under international sanctions.\n\n\u201cI recognize a lot of people here who believe in socialism. That number is increasing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere would be some crumbling of the sanctions wall, but that does not on its own free up the entire $100 billion,\u201d said Michael Malloy, a law professor at University of the Pacific McGeorge School of Law. He added that the United States controls much of the petroleum market, which is important to Iran\u2019s economy.\n\nAlso worth remembering is that the unfrozen assets would not come to Iran all at once, like a \u201csigning bonus,\u201d Malloy said.\n\nLater in the program, Todd questioned Democratic presidential candidate and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) about his call for \u201cMedicare for all\u201d and if it would mean the end of Obamacare. Without saying yes, Sanders cited high costs for health care in the United States compared with its global competitors as reason for a single-payer system.\n\n\u201cWe spend almost twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nHis claim rates False.\n\nData from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development shows that U.S. spending per capita grew to $8,713 in 2013. This is the largest in the world by at least a couple thousand dollars, but Sanders put the difference too strongly by saying it was \u201calmost twice\u201d that of any other country.\n\nSwitzerland spent the second-highest amount on health care per capita at $6,325, and Norway came in third at $5,862.\n\nFellow outsider and Republican candidate Ben Carson seemed to acknowledge the populist following of Sanders in response to a question from Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace about his proposed flat tax rate of 10 percent, akin to the biblical practice of tithing.\n\n\u201cYou make $10 billion, you pay $1 billion. Now, I know a lot of people say that\u2019s a problem because that guy\u2019s still got $9 billion left, we need to take his money. But you see, Chris, that\u2019s called socialism,\u201d Carson said. \u201cAnd I recognize a lot of people here who believe in socialism. That number is increasing.\u201d\n\nHis claim rates Half True.\n\nPolling experts said there\u2019s no data that consistently measures Americans\u2019 \u201cbelief\u201d in socialism over time, as \u201cwe haven\u2019t had a serious socialist movement or competitive party in the country,\u201d said Charles Franklin, a professor of public policy and law at Marquette University.\n\nFranklin\u2019s search of the University of Connecticut\u2019s Roper Center archive on public opinion got 70 hits for \u201csocialism\u201d out of more than 500,000 questions dating back to the 1930s.\n\nStill, two polls in recent years from Pew and Rasmussen Reports showed modest gains (within the margin of error, so the growth may not be statistically significant) for socialist views. The attitude is more favorable for young people, said Joseph Schwartz, a political theorist at Temple University.\n\n\u201cFolks under 45 did not come of political age during the Cold War,\u201d Schwartz explained. \u201cMillennials, I think, vaguely associate socialism more with Nordic social democracy than with authoritarian communism, so they see these countries as less unequal than more \u2018neoliberal\u2019 U.S.-style capitalism.\u201d\n\nPolitiFact staff writer Katie Sanders contributed to this report.

No wonder the NRA has vowed to bring her down.\n\n\u201cSomething is deeply wrong,\u201d Hillary Clinton told the audience at the Democratic National Committee on Friday. Earlier in the week, a gunman killed two journalists in Roanoke, Virginia, on live television, just days before an unstable person with a gun murdered a highway state trooper in Louisiana. It all points to a national sickness, an impotence when it comes to curbing the spread of firearms to dangerous individuals, Clinton said. \u201cI believe we can have common sense gun reform that keeps weapons out of the hands that should not have them\u2014domestic abusers, the violently unstable\u2014while respecting the rights of responsible gun owners.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton has long pushed to regulate access to guns. In her Friday speech, she pledged her presidency would be no different.\n\n\u201cNow I know the politics are hard. I know that some would rather throw up their hands and give up the fight, but not me. I\u2019m not going to sit by while more good people die across America,\u201d she said.\n\nOf course, it\u2019s easy for candidates for president\u2014especially Democratic candidates for president\u2014to say they\u2019re going to do something on guns. Actually accomplishing anything is much harder\u2014like Labor-of-Hercules difficult. After the Newtown, Connecticut, school shooting that killed 20 elementary school students and six of their teachers, President Obama made a massive push for relatively modest gun regulation. He got nothing.\n\nBut for Clinton, gun control has been a significant part of her political identity. She\u2019s been working to regulate the firearms industry for decades, and had a front row seat the last time a president actually managed to pass any gun-control measure.\n\n\u201cNow I know the politics are hard. I know that some would rather throw up their hands and give up the fight, but not me. I\u2019m not going to sit by while more good people die across America.\u201d\n\nIn other words: other candidates may say they\u2019re coming for unregulated guns. Clinton really is.\n\nNo wonder the NRA has vowed to bring her down.\n\nHer experiences in the \u201990s\u2014and the massacre of 13 people at Columbine High School in particular\u2014seemed to shape her views and belief that the laws needed to change to better protect people.\n\nThe Clinton administration came into the White House in 1993 with a pledge to sign the Brady Bill, which implemented a five-day waiting period and a background check in order to buy a handgun.\n\nOnce Bill Clinton was in the office, he worked with former White House press secretary James Brady and his wife, Sarah, to pass the bill. And it was over the course of that fight Hillary Clinton forged a strong friendship with Sarah.\n\nIn her book, Living History, Clinton marveled at the Bradys\u2019 strength.\n\n\u201cThe bill wouldn\u2019t have been possible without the tireless efforts of James and Sarah Brady,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHe and his indomitable wife, Sarah, had dedicated their lives to keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary was always really supportive, there was never a time it was in question,\u201d said a longtime friend of Sarah Brady, who asked for anonymity in order to speak candidly about their relationship. \u201cThey became incredibly close\u2014close on the issue and close personally.\u201d\n\nSarah and James, who served as President Ronald Reagan\u2019s press secretary before he was shot during an assassination attempt in 1981, both appeared at the 1992 Democratic convention in support of the Clintons.\n\nWhen Sarah Brady published her book in 2002, Hillary spoke at her book party in Washington, D.C.\n\nIf the Bradys\u2019 tenacity on the issue inspired Clinton, the mass shooting at Columbine High School emboldened her to push for changes to gun laws\u2014particularly the so-called gun show loopholes.\n\nOn April 20, 1999, two teenagers murdered 12 of their classmates and one teacher in Littleton, Colorado. It was the deadliest school shooting in American history up to that point. And it sent the country into a debate over easy access to firearms.\n\nA month after Columbine shootings, Bill and Hillary Clinton traveled to the shattered Denver suburb to meet with the families who lost their children in the violence.\n\nJoe Lockhart, the White House spokesman at the time, said one by one the Clintons were introduced to family members who had lost their kin.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to describe how unspeakably tragic it is to meet family after family all sitting in room with their loved ones, all of whom have lost a child, a brother or sister, to senseless gun violence,\u201d Lockhart, who accompanied the Clintons to Littleton after the Columbine massacre, said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to fully measure how it will impact any given person, but I\u2019m certain that it forever impacts any leader who has to go through it.\u201d\n\nClinton described the meetings as \u201cgut-wrenching\u201d in her memoir.\n\nShe reflected on seeing \u201cthe faces of parents who were living through their worst nightmare, dealing with the loss of their own children in such a senseless, disturbing act of violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cParents and teenagers alike asked Bill and me to make sure these horrible losses were not in vain,\u201d she wrote.\n\nSo when President Clinton launched a nationwide ad campaign to draw awareness to youth violence and formed a task force to examine why the nation\u2019s youth had become increasingly prone to violence, Hillary became deeply involved.\n\nJeff Bleich, who served as the director of the White House Commission on Youth Violence, said Hillary Clinton was very active in his group.\n\n\u201cMy main impression overall,\u201d he said, \u201cwas that she stayed with the issue. Some people in government lost focus on youth violence as soon as the next crisis occurred, but she and her office continued to check in to see how the program was going.\u201d\n\nAnd while the politics of gun control changed dramatically once her husband left the White House, Clinton kept at the issue once she got to the Senate, where she was a reliable vote for gun-safety measures. She supported renewing the assault weapons ban and barring the sale of high-capacity magazines.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s worked on these issues for a really long time\u2014she really comes to this as an advocate for kids and families,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of Center for American Progress and a longtime Hillary Clinton aide.\n\nWhen Clinton announced her candidacy for the Senate in February 2000, she pledged \u201cto keep guns out of the hands of criminals and away from children, for closing the gun-show loophole, requiring child safety locks and licensing all new handgun owners.\u201d\n\nShe also co-sponsored several bills aimed at closing the so-called \u201cgun show loophole\u201d and voted to renew the assault weapons ban in 2004. These efforts, however, all came up short, and the Bill Clinton-era assault weapons ban expired.\n\nThe gun-control measures were good politics in New York. But by 2008, when Hillary was running for national office, she softened her position a bit.\n\nWhen asked by NBC\u2019s Tim Russert whether she would implement a plan wherein \u201ceveryone who wishes to purchase a gun should have a license, and that every handgun sale or transfer should be registered in a national registry,\u201d during a presidential debate in 2008, Clinton said it was not politically possible.\n\n\u201cWell, I am against illegal guns, and illegal guns are the cause of so much death and injury in our country,\u201d she said. \u201cI also am a political realist and I understand that the political winds are very powerful against doing enough to try to get guns off the street, get them out of the hands of young people.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the pivot on gun control was temporary, tiny. She added, \u201cWe need to have a registry that really works, with good information about people who are felons, people who have been committed to mental institutions like the man in Virginia Tech who caused so much death and havoc. We need to make sure that that information is in a timely manner, both collected and presented.\u201d\n\nThe years since the 2008 campaign have been an exercise in frustration for the gun-control movement. And in today\u2019s presidential race, Clinton\u2019s nearest Democratic competitor\u2014Bernie Sanders\u2014voted against the Brady Bill and has a record on gun control that looks much more right-leaning than far left. Sanders represents Vermont, where gun laws are pretty much nonexistent, but those views and votes might not sit well with some of the more hard-core Democratic voters.\n\nAs one Democratic voter told The Daily Beast, Sanders is \u201cusing phrases that the gun extremists and the NRA use, saying things like it\u2019s about people not liking guns\u2026 A lot of us are super Bernie Sanders supporters and we were all really disappointed that he could talk about it this way.\u201d\n\nNRA chief Wayne LaPierre, on the other hand, had nothing but bile for Sanders\u2019s opponent.\n\n\u201cI vow on this day the NRA will stand shoulder to shoulder with you and good, honest decent Americans,\u201d he said during April\u2019s NRA convention, \u201cand we will stand and fight with everything we\u2019ve got and in 2016, by God, we will elect the next great president of the United States of America and it will not be Hillary Rodham Clinton.\u201d\n\nFor the Democratic front-runner, it was a rather sweet endorsement.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:51.558+0000"}

But let\u2019s go further: There\u2019s no good reason to deny prisoners the franchise.\n\nRecently, Hillary Clinton dramatically put voting rights back on the national agenda with an audacious call to register every American citizen when he or she turns 18. Voter ID laws are not new issues in our politics, but Clinton\u2019s full-throated appeal felt serious and sincere: Perhaps we will finally tackle the perverse voter disenfranchisement of minorities and the poor that still persists throughout this country.\n\nBut I\u2019ll go her one better. If Hillary is serious about social justice and equality, I hope she does not overlook one nearly voiceless population that needs to be included in this debate: ex-convicts returning home from prison, and, yes, even incarcerated prisoners.\n\nThe United States has the most prisoners of any developed country in the world, and it has the largest total prison population of any nation. Period. America\u2019s prison population has increased 800 percent since 1980, and much of the increase is due to harsher punishments for non-violent crimes. As a result, more than 1.57 million inmates are behind bars in federal, state, and county prisons and jails at any one time. And when you consider the estimated 12 million Americans who cycle through county jails for periods of less than a year, the total number of Americans behind bars can jump to an estimated 2.4 million.\n\nWhen you factor in released inmates who are barred from voting due to felony convictions, the number of voter-disenfranchised Americans grows to an estimated 5.85 million, or 2.5 percent of the nation\u2019s voting population, according to a recent report by The Sentencing Project.\n\nAdditionally, since America consists of a patchwork of laws varying from state to state regarding the voting rights of convicted felons, many felons who have the opportunity to vote are simply unaware or are unable to overcome the bureaucratic hurdles that would allow them to vote, and as a result they become de facto disenfranchised.\n\nSome states allow felons to vote if they are on probation, but not if they are on parole. In Tennessee a felon\u2019s voting rights can be revoked if he is late on child support payments.\n\nAccording to Myrna P\u00e9rez, deputy director of the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program, \u201cThere are some states where it does not matter what you did, how long ago it was, how young you were, etc. If you have a felony conviction in the past you have lost your right to vote permanently, unless the governor specifically decides that he or she wants to pardon you.\u201d\n\nYet finding various creative ways to keep certain Americans off the voting rolls has not been adopted by all of America. Vermont and Maine have both bucked the trend of voter disenfranchisement and allow inmates to vote.\n\nIn fact, Vermont\u2019s 1793 Constitution stipulates that residents can lose their right to vote only if convicted of voter fraud.\n\nVermont and Maine have both bucked the trend of voter disenfranchisement and allow inmates to vote.\n\nSo to the Republicans such as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who have already scoffed at Clinton\u2019s voter expansion proposal for fear that it would create voter fraud, and would inevitably deride the expansion of voting rights to felons and inmates, the State of Vermont successfully handled this issue more than two centuries ago.\n\nAt a national level, one of the biggest questions regarding inmates voting is what voting precinct these votes fall in. Many prisons are located in rural areas that are represented by Republicans at the state and national level, and as African-Americans make up a disproportionate size of the prison population, many conservative areas would be less inclined to open voting to a demographic that leans heavily Democratic.\n\nThe logical extension would be that we allow prisoners to vote absentee ballot from their known address at the time of conviction, or the address they intend to return to upon release, and not for the one where their detention facility is located.\n\nThe debate on extending voting rights to inmates and convicts is more than just an individual rights or social justice issue. It makes sense from a public policy and law enforcement perspective too. Voting has been shown to have a rehabilitative effect that can reduce recidivism and thereby, crime, and save governments millions of dollars. Recidivism has been shown to drop by at least 10 percent when voting has been extended to ex-felons.\n\n\u201cIt is important for voting rights to be extended to those that are incarcerated so that they can remain connected to the communities that they will ultimately return to,\u201d said Laurin Hodge, the president and executive director of Mission Launch, a non-profit that works to reacclimatize the previously incarcerated into civil society. \u201cUltimately prison should be about rehabilitation and not ongoing punishment.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, even for those with life sentences or on death row, the act of voting can have an impact that reverberates throughout their communities back home.\n\nIt is becoming more apparent that voting is a responsibility that needs to be fostered, and many people develop the voting habit from observing previous generations. Voting builds stronger communities of people who are more likely to participate in the democratic process. Similarly, inmates who are able to vote will feel more connected and invested in their communities, and can set a positive example to the outside world while they are behind bars.\n\nIt may be easy to discredit how informed inmates may be, but data are emerging showing that \u201cinformed\u201d voters by and large vote along party lines and are not as well versed on the issues as we would like to believe. And we need not forget that prisoners have plenty of spare time, and are one of the few demographics that could leisurely read two newspapers a day and still find time to watch the evening news.\n\nThe argument for keeping the incarcerated and the newly released off the voting rolls is based on an archaic punitive disciplinary structure that we need to move beyond. Maintaining an electoral process that actively works to disenfranchise nearly 3 percent of eligible voters is a structure that no democratic nation should support.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:51.701+0000"}

What\u2019s behind the Democrats\u2019 deepest division.\n\nAnd now it\u2019s time for the Democrats\u2019 civil war to take center stage. On Friday, the House will vote on fast-track authority for the looming Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. If the fast-track vote passes it would in essence mean that Congress couldn\u2019t tinker with the substance of the deal the administration has negotiated. The TPP itself will come up for a vote later.\n\nOn the surface of course the debate is about whether the TPP will increase or decrease American jobs. But the civil war is about something deeper. It\u2019s about the degree to which groups that have spent the last couple of generations feeling pretty powerless in American politics\u2014labor and liberals\u2014feel they can believe the assurances of people who know very well that they (labor and liberals) have lost power. Think about it; if you\u2019re involved in a negotiation and you don\u2019t have real leverage and another person is assuring you \u201cdon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll take care of you,\u201d why would you believe them, especially when, in the only other comparable high-stakes situation, that person\u2019s predecessor did not (I mean Bill Clinton on NAFTA)?\n\nActually, there are two reasons to believe this time, which are 1) that Barack Obama actually cares more about labor and environmental standards than Bill Clinton did, and 2) that two decades\u2019 worth of agitating about NAFTA\u2019s lack of standards have convinced Democrats across the board that they\u2019re necessary. I think both of these things are largely true, and so there is much evidence to support the Obama administration\u2019s claims that this deal really will be different from NAFTA.\n\nBut many liberal Democrats simply refuse to believe a word of it. Their skepticism is given weight by virtue of the fact that the debate is wholly prospective, because it\u2019s all about what would happen under a TPP regime that right now exists only in theory. And because it exists only in theory, the skeptics, even though they may be in denial about the ways in which this deal can be better than NAFTA, still might end up being right about some aspects of a pact that will unquestionably be difficult to enforce\u2014especially in the event that America someday elects a president who doesn\u2019t care about the labor and environmental standards to begin with.\n\nOverfishing is a huge problem in the world, and the 12 TPP nations account for about a third of the global marine catch.\n\nLet\u2019s start with some differences between TPP and NAFTA. Here is a White House blog post from April spelling out (in not very great detail, it must be said) the key differences. According to the White House, the TPP has these features that NAFTA lacked, among several others: a ban on child and forced labor (a big deal in some Pacific Rim countries); requirement for a minimum wage; a ban on workplace discrimination; insistence on the rights of workers in all TPP countries to organize; and the imposition of trade sanctions for violations of worker rights. Relatedly, proponents also say that the TPP has real enforcement mechanisms, with teeth, that no other trade deal, NAFTA or CAFTA or anything else, has had.\n\nThen\u2014and this aspect of the deal hasn\u2019t gotten much broad attention at all\u2014there are the environmental chapters. In early 2014, a draft version of environmental passages of the pact got out via Wikileaks. Most environmental groups didn\u2019t like what they saw. But apparently some language has been toughened up since then, and now several environmental groups are more sympathetic to the pact because of administration commitments that would protect ocean species from overfishing, combat illegal wildlife trafficking and logging, and, again, impose trade sanctions on state violators.\n\nBy this year, back in March, leaders of groups like the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy, the Humane Society, and others were speaking more positively of the TPP. If you read their statements, you see that they don\u2019t exactly say \u201cYay, We Love the TPP!\u201d, but they are more supportive than not\u2014again, only prospectively.\n\nThis, from Priscilla Ma of World Animal Protection International, is representative: \u201cWe think the TPP environment chapter is headed in the right direction, and if the Administration can deliver on its commitment to use TPP to spur greater international action to combat wildlife trafficking, illegal logging and fishing, and eliminate some of the most harmful fisheries subsidies\u2014and hold countries accountable through a binding dispute settlement mechanism\u2014it will be an important step forward on environmental protection.\u201d\n\nI spoke with Vanessa Dick, the deputy director of U.S. government relations for the WWF. She told me the WWF has taken no official position, given that there\u2019s no final language yet. But, she said, \u201cWe see the potential for conservation gains in the environmental chapters.\u201d A paper issued by the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which is negotiating the deal with the other countries, listed prohibitions on trade in illegally harvested resources like timber, seafood, and wildlife (e.g. ivory and rhino horns); also, prohibitions on subsidies that nations use to support unsustainable fishing. So it all looks good on paper. \u201cThe big condition,\u201d Dick says, \u201cis the whole question of ambition and that the language be binding.\u201d\n\nOverfishing is a huge problem in the world, and the 12 TPP nations account for about a third of the global marine catch. In the United States, imports account for nearly 90 percent of the fish consumed. So these are consequential matters. At the same time, other environmental groups that look beyond these issues tend to take a more skeptical view of the TPP, the Sierra Club being a notable example.\n\nAs to the jobs question, who knows. It will probably hurt in some places and help in others. It will harm manufacturing, but it will likely provide a lift to export-related job categories. And as Ron Brownstein points out in The National Journal, most Democrats in Congress these days represent districts in the major cities that generate a large number of export-related jobs. And he notes that most blue-collar workers, at least the white ones, vote Republican these days. And yet many Democrats are loathe to concede, to Republicans or to themselves, that their party is less the party of the working man than it used to be. (Even pro-free-trade, it\u2019s still a lot more the party of the working person than the GOP is ever likely to be.)\n\nSo this is existential for Democrats in a way it just isn\u2019t for most Republicans. The civil war metaphor can be overused. In fact, aside from trade, and to a lesser extent entitlements, the Democratic Party of today is probably more unified than at any point in my adult lifetime. No more big culture-issue divisions, for starters, and now that Larry Summers is talking populism, no huge differences on domestic economics. On foreign policy there are some bumps, but they don\u2019t compare to the GOP\u2019s (represented by Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham). On trade, though, the metaphor is apt. And since globalization isn\u2019t stopping any time soon, neither will the civil war.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:51.851+0000"}

Now he\u2019s trying to \u201cfix\u201d what he broke.\n\nGovernor Mike Pence promised Tuesday to \u201cfix\u201d a controversial law with anti-gay undertones in an attempt to stop the constant hammering the state has received since he signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act into law last week.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe for a minute that it was the intention of the general assembly to create a license to discriminate or right to deny services to gays, lesbians or anyone else in the state, and it certainly wasn\u2019t my intent, but I can appreciate that has become the perception,\u201d Pence said.\n\nBut advocates for changes to the law said if Pence didn\u2019t know this would turn into a public-relations dumpster fire, he was either willfully ignorant or simply didn\u2019t care.\n\nGay-rights advocates said they flagged the problem with the lack of protective language early in the process and pushed minor amendments to the bill, they say, would have largely resolved the issue.\n\nIt is unclear whether Pence himself knew about the amendments, but two people familiar with the lobbying effort behind the measures pro-LGBT measures said it was clear very early in the process that the governor did not want any changes to the bill.\n\n\u201cPence and his party insisted that the bill not be balanced,\u201d said Indiana Representative Ed Delaney, a Democrat and the author of an amendment that would have added the sentence \u201cthe protection of civil rights; or the prevention of discrimination; is a compelling government interest\u201d to the bill.\n\nPence\u2019s retreat\u2014just Sunday he said the law would not be changed\u2014signified that Indiana\u2019s culture warrior had, once again, bit off more than he could chew.\n\nDelaney said Pence\u2019s office either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care about the amendments.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s created this problem,\u201d Delaney said.\n\nAnother amendment would have exempted civil rights laws from RFRA\u2014a change modeled after similar laws in Missouri and Texas. (Indiana\u2019s civil rights laws do not protect LGBT individuals\u2014but several local municipalities, like Indianapolis, have laws on the books that extend civil rights protections to the LGBT community).\n\nBoth amendments were rejected by the Republican-led Indiana legislature.\n\nPence\u2019s retreat\u2014just Sunday he said the law would not be changed\u2014signified that Indiana\u2019s culture warrior had, once again, bit off more than he could chew.\n\nAs the uproar started, Pence staff thought the issue would fade, according to a source last week familiar with a conversation between Pence and his aides. So while Pence expressed surprise at the vitriol created by the law, LGBT advocates said he should have seen it coming.\n\n\u201cThere is no surprise in this,\u201d Dale Carpenter, a constitutional and civil liberties law professor at the University of Minnesota Law School.\n\n\u201cThey chose to reject those changes in the committee and again on the House floor that suggests to be the legislative intent here is to allow religious freedom to impact anti-discrimination laws,\u201d said Tyler Deaton, senior advisor at American Unity Fund, a pro-gay conservative group.\n\nPence insisted in an uncharacteristically defensive interview on This Week last Sunday the bill was about religious liberty, not discrimination.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s been shameless rhetoric about my state and about this law and about its intention all over the Internet,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople are trying to make it about one particular issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cShameless rhetoric\u201d aside, there are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of Pence\u2019s explanation, starting with the actual signing of the bill.\n\nAnd it had everything to do with the \u201cparticular issue.\u201d\n\nIn a photo of the private signing ceremony, Pence is surrounded by a small group of people\u2014including the three wise men of the anti-gay marriage movement of Indiana: Micah Clark, executive director of the American Family Association of Indiana; Curt Smith, president of the Indiana Family Institute; and Eric Miller, executive director of Advance America.\n\nDelaney said the presence of those individuals at the signing ceremony spoke volumes about the intent of the law.\n\n\u201cIs Mike Pence the only person who hasn\u2019t read their press releases?\u201d Delaney asked. \u201cHe knows what they wanted to do.\u201d\n\nPence, himself, has a long, proud record of opposing gay rights during his tenure in Congress.\n\nIt also isn\u2019t the first time he carried it into the governor\u2019s mansion, where it has had some pretty embarrassing results.\n\nA push for a constitutional ban on gay marriage in Indiana ended in failure but only after the Pence team tried to censor the opposition.\n\nWhen gay-marriage proponents posted their displeasure with the measure on Facebook, Pence\u2019s staff simply deleted the messages.\n\nInitially, Pence and his staff said they just deleted comments that were obscene\u2014 but later fessed up to removing only the comments that disagreed with the governor\u2019s position.\n\n\u201cOn careful review, it appears that this was not always the case and some comments were being deleted simply because they expressed disagreement with my position. I regret that this occurred and sincerely apologize to all those who were affected,\u201d Pence wrote in a Facebook post at the time.\n\nAdding insult to injury the measure failed, giving Pence a black eye just a year into his governorship.\n\nThis is a slightly different response than Pence was used to during his time in Washington.\n\nAs a member of Congress he had no problem opposing rights for the LGBT community.\n\nHe voted for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and against the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would have added LGBT as a protected group on the federal level from discrimination in the workplace.\n\nWhen the federal amendment to ban gay marriage failed to pass the House in 2006, Pence proclaimed it a \u201csuccessful failure.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe poured a little more concrete in the footings of a building that will be built,\u201d Pence said at the time, according to the Associated Press.\n\nHe was lauded as a hero by the right for his positions on social issues\u2014receiving multiple \u201cTrue Blue\u201d awards from the Family Research Council for \u201chis commitment to the family and sanctity of human life.\u201d\n\nThe Indiana Family Institute, which was instrumental in crafting the RFRA bill, has likewise awarded him the \u201cFriend of the Family Award.\u201d\n\nBut being a culture warrior as governor, as he has found out, has higher stakes.\n\n\u201cHe could afford to be a culture warrior because it wasn\u2019t impacting an entire state\u2019s economy,\u201d Deaton said, referring to the burgeoning \u201cboycott Indiana\u201d campaign. \u201cAnd now he has a different burden on his shoulders and this is turning out to cost the state tens of millions of dollars on the bottom line, thousands of jobs. This is really problematic for a governor.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:52.003+0000"}

Why that\u2019s stretching the truth just a tad.\n\nSenator Ted Cruz\u2019s presidential stump speech electrifies conservative crowds with a cocktail of growls, whispers, warnings of impending doom, and at least one claim of personal accomplishment so powerful, it often brings many in the audience to their feet.\n\n\u201cJust a few weeks ago, I was down in Fort Hood, where the soldiers who were shot by Nidal Hasan were finally, finally, finally awarded the Purple Heart,\u201d Cruz told activists last weekend at the conservative Freedom Forum in Greenville, S.C. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you the reason those Purple Hearts were awarded. I was very proud last year to introduce legislation in the Senate to mandate that the Pentagon award those Purple Hearts.\u201d\n\nCruz rightly pointed out that for years, the Obama administration had classified the 2009 shooting at Fort Hood, Texas, by Army Major Nidal Hasan as a \u201cworkplace violence\u201d incident rather than as a terrorist attack, though Hasan\u2019s rampage came after he had been in contact with al Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki. Hasan\u2019s shooting spree left 13 dead and 32 wounded, including dozens of military personnel who were deemed ineligible for the Purple Heart because of the Pentagon\u2019s classification of the attack as not combat-related.\n\nAt the end of 2014, Congress passed a bill requiring the Pentagon to reclassify the 2009 attack, and the Fort Hood victims were indeed awarded the Purple Heart.\n\nBut Cruz voted not once but twice against the Pentagon authorization bill that changed the Purple Heart policy. A Cruz spokesman told the Dallas Morning News that Cruz voted against the bill over an issue unrelated to the Fort Hood shootings but that \u201che would have found another way to get it done\u201d had the bill had not passed. \u201cSupporting one amendment certainly does not mean a senator is obligated to support the entire bill.\u201d\n\nAnd although Cruz played an important role on the Senate Armed Services Committee at last year, the credit for changing the Pentagon\u2019s long-standing policy belongs to at least a dozen senators and members of Congress who had pushed the issue relentlessly for years before Cruz ever arrived in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe claim nonetheless omits what Lieberman, Cornyn and others had done to get the ball to the one-yard line.\u201d\n\nIt was Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), not Cruz, who originally introduced legislation to award the Purple Heart to the Fort Hood victims in 2009. Cornyn\u2019s bill coincided with a similar bill from Representative John Carter (R-TX), whose district includes much of Fort Hood. Cornyn and Carter would introduce their bills again in 2011 and 2013. Representatives Roger Williams (R-TX), Frank Wolf (R-VA), and Peter King (R-NY) all pushed the matter in their own committees.\n\nRepresentative Michael McCaul, another Texas Republican and the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, held hearings on the matter. Senator Joe Lieberman (I/D-CT), the former chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, did the same and commissioned a months-long investigation into the causes of the Fort Hood attack.\n\nLieberman introduced a bill of his own, along with Cornyn, in 2012 to mandate that the Pentagon change its criteria for awarding the Purple Heart that would include the Fort Hood victims. In 2014, Senator John Boozman, a Republican from Arkansas who is also on the Armed Services Committee, wrote legislation similar to Cruz\u2019s to mandate that the Pentagon award Purple Hearts to victims of a similar shooting at a Little Rock military recruiting center in 2009.\n\nNeal Sher, a lead attorney for the Fort Hood victims and their families who sued the Pentagon over the policy, said the reclassification was the result of efforts by multiple offices for multiple years on and off Capitol Hill.\n\n\u201cCruz was instrumental, Cornyn was instrumental, the Texas House delegation, McCaul, Carter, Williams, were all instrumental,\u201d said Sher. \u201cIt took years, years. The administration and the Pentagon were opposing it every step of the way. It took an act of Congress to get them to change their tune.\u201d\n\nA staffer who worked on the issue agreed that Cruz did play an important part in the final result for the families, but \u201cthe claim nonetheless omits what Lieberman, Cornyn and others had done to get the ball to the one-yard line. In other words, \u2018the reason those Purple Hearts were awarded\u2019 phrase is true but insufficient. \u201c\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Cruz has claimed credit for something on the campaign trail that has raised eyebrows back in Washington.\n\nCruz ran into a buzz saw with Senator John McCain last month after the Texas senator told a New Hampshire audience that he had been pressing McCain to hold congressional hearings to allow members of the military to carry personal firearms on military bases. Cruz suggested that McCain had yet to respond.\n\nMcCain said Cruz had never spoken with him about it at all.\n\n\u201cAsk him how he communicated with me because I\u2019d be very interested. Who knows what I\u2019m missing?\u201d McCain said to a group of reporters in the Capitol, according to The Hill. \u201cMaybe it was through some medium that I\u2019m not familiar with. Maybe bouncing it off the ozone layer, for all I know. There\u2019s a lot of holes in the ozone layer, so maybe it wasn\u2019t the ozone layer that he bounced it off of. Maybe it was through hand telegraph, maybe sign language, who knows?\u201d\n\nCruz later acknowledged he \u201cmay have misspoken\u201d about his outreach to McCain. Cruz\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment on his Fort Hood remarks.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:52.470+0000"}
{"entityId": 1830, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Suffice it to say the Wisconsin governor and 2016 hopeful has a hard time explaining his views on the subject.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to say LGBT issues are not Scott Walker\u2019s favorite conversation topic.\n\nQuestions about various aspects of the gay-rights debate have frequently tripped him up on the campaign trail\u2014most recently during an interview on CNN when he was asked whether being gay was a choice.\n\n\u201cOh, I mean, I think that\u2019s\u2014that\u2019s not even an issue for me to be involved in,\u201d the Wisconsin governor said. \u201cThe bottom line is, I\u2019m going to stand up and work hard for every American, regardless of who they are, no matter where they come from, no matter what their background, I\u2019m going to fight for people, whether they vote for me or not.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo act on behalf of people is, to do that properly, you have to understand or at least have an opinion on who they are and where they\u2019re coming from,\u201d reporter Dana Bash replied.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on every single issue out there,\u201d Walker continued. \u201cI mean, to me, that\u2019s, I don\u2019t know,\u201d Walker answered. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answer to that question.\u201d\n\nThe born-gay question wasn\u2019t the only issue putting the governor in a bit of a quandary; his much-chronicled comments on whether or not the Boy Scouts should let gay men serve as scoutmasters created a bit of a hullabaloo. The governor initially told IJReview that he supported the exclusionary policy \u201cbecause it protected children and advanced scout values.\u201d\n\nHis campaign team promptly walked that back , countering the implication that gay men put Boy Scouts in danger.\n\n\u201cThe previous policy protected Scouts from the rancorous political debate over policy issues and culture wars,\u201d said campaign spokeswoman Ashlee Strong. \u201cScouts should not be used as a political football on issues that can often be heated and divisive.\u201d\n\nWalker also has given curious answers to questions about attending a gay wedding. His son Alex was a witness at the wedding of his wife\u2019s cousin to her same-sex partner; Walker went to the reception.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been to a wedding,\u201d he said in April at a press conference in New Hampshire , referring to same-sex ceremonies. \u201cThat\u2019s true even though my position on marriage is still that\u2019s defined between a man and a woman, and I support the Constitution of the state. But for someone I love, we\u2019ve been at a reception.\u201d\n\nWalker may be no better at discussing the issue in private. The Washington Post reported in June that one Republican billionaire hedge fund manager withdrew support for the governor after the two had a long argument about the issue.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have an opinion on every single issue out there,\u201d Walker said.\n\nAnd the governor also recently suggested that reporters had for weeks been inaccurately describing his wife\u2019s stance on gay marriage.\n\nSo what gives?\n\nRepresentative Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), an openly gay member of Congress who worked with Walker when they were both members of the state Assembly, suggested his confusion might have more to do with his political profile than his position on LGBT rights.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to decide if it\u2019s just extreme pandering or unfortunate ignorance,\u201d he said. \u201cMost people quit thinking that way in the \u201960s and \u201970s.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cI think the best question that someone should ask him is, \u2018Well, when did you decide to be straight,\u2019 Governor Walker?\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s tone is a significant departure from their days in the Assembly, Pocan said.\n\n\u201cHe never displayed that depth of ignorance when he was in the legis or as governor,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe certainly talked a tough game when it came to issues like marriage equality, but he never put that large of a display of misinformation out there at the time.\u201d\n\nWisconsin social conservatives seem confident that the governor\u2019s equivocation on the question of whether or not people are born gay doesn\u2019t have any bearing on his opposition to same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all kinds of issues that presidential candidates are asked about,\u201d said Julaine Appling, who heads the socially conservative group Wisconsin Family Action. \u201cThe governor and I may have some differences of opinion on some of the things, but when it comes down to what he\u2019s done to support the marriage amendment, that it\u2019s specifically between one man and woman in this state, his track record speaks for itself.\u201d\n\nDuring his first gubernatorial campaign, Walker adamantly supported the state legislature\u2019s push to pass a constitutional amendment limiting marriage to one man-one woman couples. That effort was successful and he defended the amendment in court, though its backers ultimately lost.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his only time fighting same-sex marriage rights. He also consistently opposed efforts to provide benefits to the same-sex partners of state and county employees, as the Human Rights Campaign documents in their Walker dossier .\n\nBut since the state\u2019s marriage amendment lost in court, he\u2019s shown little verve to discuss LGBT issues.\n\nOn Meet the Press in March 2013 , he said young Republican voters \u201cdon\u2019t want to get focused on those issues.\u201d The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported he had an awkward exchange with Wisconsin reporters in June 2014 when he suggested that his view on same-sex marriage rights doesn\u2019t matter and that he didn\u2019t want to talk about it at all.\n\nOn top of that, he told Bloomberg in 2013 that a proper balance of rights for LGBT people would protect them from discrimination in the workplace but also keep them from marrying. That\u2019s how Wisconsin handled gay rights, he said, and that\u2019s the way to do it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had no problems\u2014or I should say, limited problems\u2014with that,\u201d he said, referring to the state\u2019s employment protection law. \u201cAt the same time, we still have a constitutional amendment that defines marriage. There\u2019s a healthy balance there.\u201d\n\nSo Walker\u2019s record on LGBT issues was a little more nuanced than, say, Rick Santorum\u2019s.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples have a constitutional right to wed, Walker came out in favor of amending the U.S. Constitution to give states the right to prohibit such unions. And as for the social conservative leaders he needs to woo in order to do well in Iowa? They loved it .\n\nThen there\u2019s the views of his wife, Tonette.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post published on July 5, she suggested that she disagrees with the governor on the question of whether or not same-sex couples should be able to marry.\n\n\u201cThat was a hard one,\u201d she told the paper. \u201cOur sons were disappointed. ... I was torn. I have children who are very passionate [in favor of same-sex marriage], and Scott was on his side very passionate.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me because I have a cousin who I love dearly\u2014she is like a sister to me\u2014who is married to a woman, her partner of 18 years,\u201d she said.\n\nThat was widely seen as an endorsement of same-sex marriage. Two weeks later, on July 13, ABC News reported that as uncontroversial fact.\n\n\u201cThey were all on one side, Dad on the other,\u201d said host David Muir when talking about the family\u2019s views on the issue.\n\nSo there it was: Scott Walker\u2019s wife backed same-sex marriage. At The Daily Caller, Matt Lewis wrote a column suggesting that this might give some social conservatives pause. And Iowa conservative radio talk show host Steve Deace said the Walker family\u2019s support for same-sex marriage concerned him (\u201cThat\u2019s not good,\u201d he told The Daily Beast).\n\nBut on Sunday, July 19\u2014two weeks after The Washington Post suggested Tonette favored same-sex marriage\u2014Walker told CBN News\u2019s David Brody that, actually, all those reports were wrong, and she\u2019s actually against letting same-sex couples marry.\n\n\u201cMy wife actually supports my position,\u201d he told Brody during an interview with Brody on his campaign bus. \u201cShe pointed out she was torn by the fact that she\u2019s got me with a position and she\u2019s got others family members in different position, but being emotionally torn doesn\u2019t mean that she\u2019s got a difference of opinion.\u201d\n\nBut what is that position exactly?

Don\u2019t cable execs realize their wall-to-wall coverage is making him relevant?\n\nDonald Trump sat down with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, in the lobby of Trump Tower, to discuss his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Trump talked about Hillary Clinton: \u201cthe worst secretary of state in the history of the United States\u201d; himself: \u201cI\u2019ve been very successful, everybody loves me\u201d; immigration: \u201cMexico pushes back people across the borders that are criminals, that are drug dealers\u201d; the Middle East: \u201cI would bomb the hell out of those oil fields\u201d; and himself, again: \u201cHere\u2019s the good news: I\u2019m very rich.\u201d\n\nTrump is like the Malaysian plane, if the Malaysian plane were not missing but excessively visible and loud, and instilled in all who entered its orbit a sense that mortality may not be a mysterious, universal injustice but a welcome escape from future presidential primaries.\n\nIt\u2019s not just Trump himself who makes me want to die but the incessant coverage of his ascent by cable news, which always seems to leave out the fact that his ascent is directly correlated to its coverage.\n\nCandidate Trump, currently polling in second place nationally among Republican primary voters, was conceived and birthed and nurtured by the same networks that now spend their hours breathlessly analyzing just how in the hell something like this could have happened and what it means for the future of the GOP primary and, by extension, the country.\n\nFor almost two decades, Trump was given enough attention to sustain himself by merely pretending to run for president. In 2000, he floated running as an independent\u2014something he said during Wednesday\u2019s interview he now wouldn\u2019t consider because \u201cRoss Perot, had he not been there, you would have never heard of Bill Clinton.\u201d In 2006, the New York Post reported Trump was mulling running in 2008, again as an independent. In 2010, Trump was publicly saying he might run as a Republican. By 2012, picking apart Trump\u2019s game of campaign chicken had become a national pastime.\n\nThe difference now is that Trump really is running, meaning his poll numbers can actually gain him entry to debates and his presence at those debates will force other candidates to respond to what he says (which they\u2019re doing already).

They\u2019ve looked to change how the United States handles incarceration and policing, while rolling back some of the Clinton-era prison policies that led to a spike in the prison population.\n\nAnd they\u2019ve had some significant successes on the state level, notably in Georgia and Texas. Now, they\u2019re aiming for criminal justice reform in Washington.\n\nAnd their efforts looked promising\u2014until Kate\u2019s Law.\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of the ugly killing of Kate Steinle.\n\nSteinle was shot and killed by an undocumented immigrant this early summer while on Pier 14, a popular tourist destination in San Francisco. The immigrant had been deported five times but returned to San Francisco, a city that doesn\u2019t cooperate fully with federal immigration enforcement efforts. Steinle\u2019s killing sparked national outrage, and that outrage sparked a call to, well, do something.\n\nWhat resulted is called Kate\u2019s Law, a bill named after the victim, pushed by her parents, and boosted before a massive audience by Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans have been victimized by illegal aliens who had previously been deported,\u201d Ted Cruz said. \u201cWe must send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated.\u201d\n\nThat bill would require a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for any undocumented immigrant convicted of illegally re-entering the United States after being deported. Arizona Republican Rep. Matt Salmon introduced the bill in the House, and Sen. Ted Cruz introduced a companion version in the Senate. And that has conservative criminal justice reformers holding their heads in their hands.\n\nMandatory minimum sentence requirements have long been a popular way for politicians to burnish their \u201ctough on crime\u201d reputations. Nobody ever lost an election for being too anti-criminal.\n\nBut in the process, America\u2019s prison population skyrocketed, doing outsize damage to African-American communities\u2014as well as state and federal budgets. Mass incarceration doesn\u2019t come cheap, and that was why conservative legislators in Texas started moved to overhaul the state\u2019s criminal justice system back in 2007\u2014it was getting too expensive to lock up that many people, so they reformed how sentencing worked and changed rules regarding probation and parole. The outcomes there were great: the state saved money, reduced its incarceration levels, and crime went down in the process.\n\nSince then, conservative lawmakers have been trying to go national with some of those reforms. This year could have been their best opportunity yet\u2014President Obama has signalled that he\u2019s interested in the sentencing reform issue, lawmakers in both the House and the Senate have formed bipartisan, pan-ideological coalitions to back a variety of bills, and the Black Lives Matters protests have pushed criminal justice issues into the headlines like never before.\n\nCruz has also been a key player in those efforts, co-sponsoring legislation on the issue and calling for a reexamination to \u201ccurrent draconian mandatory minimum sentences.\u201d He\u2019s even waxed poetic on the issue.\n\n\u201cToday, far too many young men\u2014and in particular African-American young men . . . find themselves subject to sentences of many decades for relatively minor, nonviolent drug infractions,\u201d he said in February, per Rolling Stone. \u201cWe should not live in a world of Les Mis\u00e9rables, where a young man finds his entire future taken away by excessive mandatory minimums.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Kate\u2019s Law, which Cruz has energetically boosted on the presidential campaign trail, could sizably increase the prison population by forcing nonviolent offenders to spend years in prison\u2014and, conservative criminal justice experts say, without having a sizable impact on how many deported immigrants unlawfully return to the United States. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, the law would likely send 60,000 more people to federal prison over the next five years. That would increase the federal prison population by 28 percent and would cost about $2 billion per year.\n\nCruz argues the bill is a step in the right direction.\n\n\u201cToo many Americans have been victimized by illegal aliens who had previously been deported,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWe must send the message that defiance of our laws will no longer be tolerated.\u201d\n\nOthers disagree.\n\n\u201cMandatory minimums don\u2019t deter crime, and they seldom punish only the offenders who inspire legislation like Kate\u2019s Law,\u201d said Molly Gill of Families Against Mandatory Minimums in a statement. \u201cThis bill won\u2019t stop deported immigrants from re-entering the country, but it will force American taxpayers to pay for half a decade\u2019s worth of food, clothing, and housing for people we supposedly don\u2019t want in the country at all.\u201d\n\nOn this issue, Cruz has even lost one of his closest allies. Sen. Mike Lee, a Tea Party favorite from Utah, opposes creating new mandatory minimum sentences and has been \u201ca particular thorn\u201d for its boosters, according to Politico. And other conservative criminal justice advocates have been baffled by Cruz\u2019s stance. One conservative who\u2019s worked extensively on criminal justice issues said he found Cruz\u2019s advocacy for the bill particularly surprising, given the senator\u2019s invocation of Les Miserables to denounce lengthy mandatory minimums. And Pat Nolan, who helms the American Conservative Union Foundation\u2019s Center for Criminal Justice Reform, said Kate\u2019s Law could undermine their efforts to roll back other mandatory minimums.\n\n\u201cI do think it\u2019s a step backwards,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a disconnect\u2014they know that mandatory minimums haven\u2019t worked, they know that they\u2019ve resulted in absurdly long sentences for rather minor players, and so, yeah, it\u2019s like all of the progress that we\u2019ve made in showing policymakers that the mandatory minimums are counterproductive gets swept away in the emotion of the moment.\u201d\n\nNolan added that our country\u2019s experience with mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug offenders would likely predict what kind of results we could expect from similar rules for nonviolent immigration offenders.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of folks who have come back across the border, and they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the idea of having them locked up for five years on the taxpayer\u2019s dime seems like a really extravagant way to deal with it.\u201d\n\nOn top of that, he added, mandatory minimums are notoriously ineffective at actually deterring crime.\n\n\u201cThat presumes that criminals are rational calculators, that they say, \u2018Oh, I was gonna do that, but gee, they raised the penalty, so I\u2019m not going to commit that crime,\u2019\u201d Nolan said. \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that works at all. These folks are not rational calculators. They all think they\u2019re smarter than everybody else, and they don\u2019t think they\u2019re going to get caught.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s laughable,\u201d he added, of the efforts to limit drug crimes by hiking sentencing requirements. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t stopped that at all.\u201d\n\nJohn Malcolm, who works on criminal justice issues at the Heritage Foundation, shared Nolan\u2019s skepticism about the effectiveness of mandatory minimums to deter crime.\n\n\u201cDespite the existence of mandatory minimum penalties at the federal level and in many states, replacing drug dealers has not been a very difficult thing for cartel organizations,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce a drug dealer is arrested, there will be three or four there to take their place. If you were looking for evidence of general deterrence in the drug area, you\u2019d be hard pressed to find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are people in other countries who are desperate to come to our shores,\u201d he added, \u201cand they\u2019re probably willing to risk certain penalties.\u201d\n\nBryan Johnson, an immigration attorney who has represented clients who have illegally reentered the United States after being deported, said these migrants typically return because they\u2019re fleeing danger in their home countries or because they\u2019re seeking to reunited with family here.\n\n\u201cThe fact that someone illegally reenters the United States has no bearing on whether they\u2019re going to, in the future, commit a criminal offense,\u201d he said.\n\nIn short, Kate\u2019s Law would be enormously expensive, and there\u2019s scant evidence it would be worth the cost.

{"entityId": 1833, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A college-age grandson of modern conservatism\u2019s founding family comes out in The Daily Beast and makes the case for the freedom to marry.\n\nIf you had asked me a few years ago if I supported the freedom to marry, I\u2019d have been one of many young Republicans at the time who\u2019d have given you an unequivocal \u201cno.\u201d\n\nAs the grandson of former Conservative Party New York Sen. James L. Buckley and great-nephew of National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr., I believed that gay rights were inherently anti-conservative and anti-Catholic.\n\nBut I began to reexamine my views after acknowledging a part of myself that I\u2019d suppressed for years\u2014I am gay.\n\nMy family is loving and compassionate but they have been active in the fight to keep marriage limited to heterosexual couples. Because of their influence and the views expressed by so many in my religious community, I grew up with an extremely negative view of gay people.\n\nI was taught a \u201chate the sin, love the sinner\u201d approach to moral issues while always being told to respect those with whom I disagreed. But given that you can\u2019t separate yourself from who you love, teaching someone to hate their sexual orientation inadvertently teaches them to hate themselves. For me, this led to an intense self-hatred and a reflexive rejection of anyone that resembled the part of me I was so desperately trying to fight.\n\nAs early as high school I felt that my current university, Georgetown, had betrayed its Catholic faith by supporting an LGBTQ organization. But as the fact that I\u2019m gay became increasingly difficult to deny, I struggled to identify with a conservative political community that disdains who I am, and a gay personal community that largely disagrees with what I believe.\n\nBecause I refuse to sacrifice my faith in God or conservative values, I had to find a way to reconcile these conflicts through a conservative lens.\n\n\u201cAs the fact that I\u2019m gay became increasingly difficult to deny, I struggled to identify with a conservative political community that disdains who I am, and a gay personal community that largely disagrees with what I believe.\u201d\n\nAmerican conservatives hold many different views but there are some core principles that help guide us toward specific policy prescriptions. Conservatives reject the idea of moral relativism and believe there are certain eternal truths regardless of time, place, or culture. We believe the collection of laws and institutions in place today are an amalgamation of human trial and error pursued in the effort to reach those universal truths. Finally, conservative thought demands recognition of our fallible human nature amid the understanding that we are all limited in our pursuit of truth and virtue.\n\nProgress is good, but as Russell Kirk, one of the fathers of American conservative thought, put it: \u201cchange and reform are not identical.\u201d As history has made abundantly clear, no country or culture is immune to bad ideas taking hold. Recognizing this, conservatism suggests we should slow the pace of change, especially in times of intense public disagreement. Under this framework, I understand why many conservatives in the U.S. are unnerved by granting the freedom to marry to same-sex couples. Just a few years ago, I stood with them.\n\nBut in the past decade, never mind the last century, attitudes and responses towards gay people as individuals and a community as a whole have drastically changed.\n\nBefore 2003, it wasn\u2019t legal for two loving, committed individuals of the same sex to enter into what has been the most fundamental building block of our society\u2014marriage. Today, gay and lesbian couples have the freedom to marry in 37 states, with the number poised to keep growing.\n\nA clear majority of Americans now understand that being gay is not a choice. Gradually, this understanding is also extending among conservatives. And over 60% of millennial evangelical youth now support the freedom to marry.\n\nHistorically, marriage was primarily considered an economic and political transaction between families. As such, it was too vital of an institution to be entered into solely on the basis of something as irrational as love. It was not until the dawn of the Enlightenment in the 18th century that the idea of marrying primarily for love arrived. Those who opposed this shift saw it as an affront to social order, and rejected it as a dangerous change in the definition of marriage\u2014similar to the arguments today.\n\nBut we\u2019ve evolved, and learned that marriage matters for other reasons. At its core the institution of marriage hinges on two individuals committing to one another in life, for life, on a bedrock of love and self-sacrifice, which results in a better environment for raising children.\n\nAbove all else, the greatest gift our parents can give us is to teach us how to love\u2014an emotion that gives the human experience both the purpose and meaning that is so critical to a happy and healthy life. I count this as one of the greatest gifts my parents have given me, and hope to one day give the same to my kids. Conservatives are right to argue that the best environment to raise children is within a marriage. However, it has nothing to do with the gender of their parents but instead the love they have for one another.\n\nMost people would agree that the shift from marriage focused on political considerations to marriage built on love was for the best. What they may not consider is that at its core, this shift was in recognition of a universal right to follow one\u2019s heart. In this, granting the freedom to marry to all loving couples is not a shift from the central tenet of marriage, but instead a fulfillment of its most basic ideals.\n\nGay couples today are building families and raising children. If we as conservatives care about preserving marriage and family, we must include gay people in the equation.\n\nAs a Young Conservative for the Freedom to Marry, I believe that individuals have the power and ability to make decisions for themselves better than any government can. For conservatives who likely agree, I ask: why does this suddenly change when it comes to whom one loves and chooses to marry? This is a fight specific to the LGBT community, but it is also a fight for the rights of individual self-determination\u2014a cause conservatives should always be ready and willing to fight for.\n\nAs the Supreme Court prepares to consider whether all loving couples should have the freedom to marry, it is time for conservatives to recognize that just as individual liberty should not depend on a person\u2019s gender or race, it should not depend on whom a person loves, either.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:53.066+0000"}

His campaign, a show. And people are watching.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also worth acknowledging that The Donald is a traffic-driver for news sites such as The Daily Beast, much as Sarah Palin was in the former Alaska governor\u2019s political heyday, and it\u2019s utter folly to turn up one\u2019s nose at the prospect of more eyeballs.\n\nThe question is whether some outlets are willing to trade tough-minded journalism for access to Trump and his ardent audience.\n\n\u201cThe story in all its forms\u2014whether you\u2019re talking to him, or about him, or what\u2019s happening to the Republican Party because of him\u2014has enhanced everybody\u2019s ratings for the time they spend on it,\u201d said a longtime news executive who, like several people interviewed for this article, asked for anonymity so as not to risk offending their television competitors or the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cThere are people on the air in this industry who will let him talk just because they knew they get a rating when he\u2019s on their show,\u201d this executive continued. \u201cThere are other people who take their job seriously and will question him toughly.\u201d\n\nTrump is, conspicuously, cable catnip.\n\nHe has been such a constant presence on CNN\u2014including a mostly friendly half-hour phone interview Tuesday morning with New Day host Chris Cuomo\u2014that he\u2019s becoming this year\u2019s answer to the network\u2019s over-the-top coverage of missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 or, before that, the Carnival Cruise Lines \u201cpoop ship\u201d debacle.\n\nTrump has practically taken up residence on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program, phoning in regularly to schmooze with his television pals Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski, who always address him as \u201cDonald,\u201d not \u201cMr. Trump,\u201d while he once called and crooned, \u201cHello, darling\u201d\u2014and they seem to spend a lot of their interview time joking around and laughing with him.\n\n\u201cDonald is not afraid of anybody but Roger Ailes...Donald was not looking forward to a phone call from Roger Ailes.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski\u2014who stumped the candidate on Monday with a pointed question on whether he supports a mandate for equal pay for women (Trump begged off, saying he\u2019d have to get back to her)\u2014makes no apologies for the show\u2019s welcoming stance.\n\n\u201cIf you have the chance to interview the Republican front-runner, don\u2019t you take it?\u201d she told The Daily Beast. \u201cQuite frankly, if the Democratic front-runner, or the second-, third- or fourth-polling Republican\u2014even Jeb Bush, or Marco Rubio, I don\u2019t know\u2014if they wanted to be on our show, we would take them in a heartbeat. We would take them on the phone even.\u201d\n\nAs broadcast anchors such as ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos of This Week and NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd of Meet the Press learned on their Sunday shows this past weekend, a phone interview with Trump is all but impossible to steer; the host can\u2019t discipline a filibustering or, for that matter, a hard-of-hearing candidate by leaning in and making eye contact, or a crisp gesticulation.\n\nMuch of the control rests with the interviewee\u2014a probable reason that Fox\u2019s Chris Wallace has informed Trump\u2019s and other campaigns that their candidates must appear on camera or not at all for Fox News Sunday.\n\nHannity, who conducted his pre-recorded one-on-one in the ostentatiously marbled, brassy lobby of Trump Tower, the candidate\u2019s corporate headquarters a stone\u2019s throw from Fox News\u2019s midtown Manhattan studios, was not the kind of hard-nosed interrogator to give his guest the third degree.\n\nInstead, while touting the interview as a substantive policy discussion, he let Trump get away with the same bold but vague assertions that he\u2019s been making everywhere else about how he will stop illegal immigration from Mexico and force the Mexican government to pay for an impenetrable wall along the border, replace Obamacare with something really great, and \u201ccherish\u201d women, among other laudable sentiments.\n\nThe single most interesting, if dubious, revelation\u2014in response to Hannity\u2019s question about how Trump has managed to evolve from a socially liberal Democrat to a right-wing Republican\u2014was the candidate\u2019s claim that he had been friendly with a similarly-transformed conservative icon, Ronald Reagan.\n\n\u201cI knew him well,\u201d Trump proclaimed. \u201cHe liked me. I liked him. He was, like, a great guy.\u201d\n\nHannity didn\u2019t even ask Trump to back up his assertion that the real national unemployment rate is not 5.3 percent (the official Bureau of Labor Statistics figure) but \u201cmore like 40 percent.\u201d\n\nHannity\u2019s reference to the Megyn Kelly unpleasantness\u2014in which enraged Trump supporters flooded social media with nasty and misogynist anti-Kelly remarks after their hero\u2019s off-color insult\u2014was decidedly veiled.\n\n\u201cThe Fox issue is resolved,\u201d Hannity suggested to Trump, who agreed that Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes \u201ccalled me the other day, and it\u2019s absolutely fine.\u201d\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, former Fox News personality Glenn Beck offered a more detailed, saltier, and more correct version of the Ailes-Trump phone call on his talk show Tuesday.\n\n\u201cRoger Ailes called Donald Trump and said, \u2018Knock it off,\u2019\u201d Beck told his audience. \u201cDonald is not afraid of anybody but Roger Ailes\u2026Donald was not looking forward to a phone call from Roger Ailes. And he gets that phone call, and Roger says, \u2018Trump, knock it off. Knock it off.\u2019 This is my guess of what happened.\u201d\n\nA source with knowledge of the phone call laughed and told The Daily Beast that Beck\u2019s version \u201cis pretty close to being accurate.\u201d\n\nHannity, of course, doesn\u2019t pretend to be a journalist, yet his sympathetic Q&A with the thatch-roofed front-runner was barely distinguishable from some of Trump\u2019s recent encounters with supposedly hard-hitting reporters.\n\nDon Lemon, for one, allowed the candidate to bang on, largely unchallenged, in his trademark stream-of consciousness mix of braggadocio, invective, counterfactual assertions and comradely bonhomie.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a smart guy,\u201d Trump declared, citing for the umpteenth time his studies at the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton School of Business. Pulitzer Prize-winning columnist Charles Krauthammer, a Trump detractor, is \u201ca real jerk,\u201d the candidate claimed. Republican pollster Frank Luntz, whose post-debate focus group on Fox News indicated that Trump was losing support, is \u201ca dunce,\u201d \u201ca dope,\u201d and \u201ca wise guy,\u201d Trump said.\n\nMegyn Kelly, meanwhile, \u201cis a lightweight\u201d\u2014an assertion Lemon mildly countered, arguing to his guest that she\u2019s \u201ca very respected journalist,\u201d although the CNN anchor didn\u2019t call Trump on his ungentlemanly \u201cblood out of her whatever\u201d snipe.\n\nToward the end of the interview, Trump told Lemon, \u201cYou guys are making a lot of progress thanks to me, because your ratings are way up, because you\u2019re covering Trump all the time. So I should get a piece of it, don\u2019t you think?

But unfortunately, it\u2019s becoming predictable within the GOP.\n\n\u201cIf the court tries to do this it will be rampant judicial activism,\u201d Cruz said before the ruling. \u201cIt will be lawlessness.\u201d\n\nNo, actually, saying that as a senator or as president you will disobey the ruling of the Supreme Court of the United States of America\u2014that is the very definition of lawlessness.\n\n\u201cWe will not honor any decision by the Supreme Court which will force us to violate a clear biblical understanding of marriage as solely the union of one man and one woman.\u201d\n\n\n\nOf course this attitude comes from the same party that after 60 failed votes to repeal Obamacare and two now failed legal challenges rising all the way up to the very same Supreme Court, still pledges to keep trying to undo the law. The modern Republican Party is operating less like a responsible partner in governance and more and more like an underground crime network\u2014continually abusing and threatening the otherwise democratic process if it doesn\u2019t get its way.\n\nSo far, in the aftermath of the decision, Republican candidates have offered statements affirming their opposition to the ruling and leaning on the new, more modest GOP chestnut that \u201creligious freedom\u201d must be protected.\n\nGovernor Huckabee took to Twitter after the ruling, saying that the Supreme Court could no more overrule \u201cGod\u2019s nature\u201d than overrule gravity. But alas, just as it has in fights for justice and equality throughout history, the Supreme Court has done its job\u2014interpreting the Constitution of our nation and applying it equally to all Americans.\n\nMeanwhile, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker issued one of the more curious formulations. \u201cI call on the president and all governors to join me in reassuring millions of Americans that the government will not force them to participate in activities that violate their deeply held religious beliefs,\u201d he said in a press release. \u201cNo one wants to live in a country where the government coerces people to act in opposition to their conscience.\u201d\n\nApparently, Walker is afraid people will be forced to get gay married. Don\u2019t worry, America, that\u2019s Phase 143 of the gay agenda. It\u2019s still early. Right now, we\u2019re preoccupied trying to uphold the basic values and laws of America\u2014which elected officials of both parties should be doing, too. But frankly, when it comes to some Republicans, it\u2019s indeed more likely that gravity will be overruled and pigs will fly.\n\nRELATED:\n\nGOP Field Split on Anti-Gay Marriage Amendment\n\n\n\nLGBT Leaders: Gay Marriage Is Not Enough\n\nSupreme Court On Gay Marriage: It\u2019s Here, And There\u2019s No Going Back\n\n\n\nScenes From A Supreme Victory For Same-Sex Marriage (PHOTOS)\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:53.371+0000"}

During dinner, Hillary Clinton writes, Gingrich leaned over told Clinton the accusations against her husband were \u201cludicrous,\u201d that it was \u201cterribly unfair the some people are trying to make something out of it\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s not going anywhere\u201d\u2014before leading the effort to impeach President Clinton.\n\nGingrich told The Daily Beast that Clinton came to him when she was crafting \u201cHillarycare\u201d to get his thoughts on the bill.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of respect for her.

The piece, titled, \u201cBorn gay? No way,\u201d was written by Ed Manners, a pastor at Kirkwood Baptist Church in Clarksville, Tennessee.

Guter, a retired rear admiral and formerly the Navy\u2019s top uniformed lawyer. \u201cI cannot respect such comments from anyone, but especially from one who never served.\u201d\n\nAfter McCain labeled Trump\u2019s supporters \u201ccrazies\u201d in an interview with The New Yorker on Wednesday, Trump retaliated with a series of insults, culminating with his remarks about McCain\u2019s military service at the Family Leadership Summit in Iowa on Saturday. \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe\u2019s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d\n\nThe fallout was immediate, and marked a turning point for Trump, who had, for the first month of his presidential campaign, been afforded the right to say just about anything\u2014memorably, that undocumented Mexican immigrants are criminals and \u201crapists\u201d\u2014without widespread condemnation from elected officials and political leaders. The insult to McCain\u2019s record was different, however. Within hours of its utterance, nearly every single Republican primary contender had taken to social media to voice their support for McCain or their disgust with Trump.\n\nAnd it wasn\u2019t just them\u2014veterans groups and veterans themselves have taken deep offense to Trump\u2019s remarks, especially given Trump never served in the Vietnam War, as the Arizona senator did. Trump instead received a medical deferment in 1968.\n\n\u201cI would not want to serve under anyone who thinks this is an appropriate comment... I cannot respect such comments from anyone, but especially from one who never served.\u201d\n\nJon Soltz, a veteran and founder of the progressive group VoteVets, said he approached Trump at a fundraiser in 2007, asking the businessman if he would like to help Afghanistan and Iraq vets get elected. \u201cSend me a letter,\u201d Trump responded abruptly, before turning his back, according to Soltz.\n\n\u201cVoteVets and John McCain are at odds weekly,\u201d Soltz told The Daily Beast, \u201cbut we do respect his service, and what he did in Vietnam by not leaving [when offered a chance by his captors] was heroic. Republicans and Democrats who have a service background think what Donald Trump said was terrible.\u201d\n\nMcCain appeared on Monday afternoon at a press conference with Lindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, and Joe Lieberman, the one-time Democrat from Connecticut. The senators, dubbed \u201cthe Three Amigos\u201d by General David Petraeus, were ostensibly in the gilded, second-floor ballroom at 3 West Club in Midtown Manhattan to discuss the Iran deal and promote the presidential candidacy of Graham\u2014but first there would need to be a few words about Trump.\n\n\u201cSome people say that John McCain is not an American hero,\u201d Graham began. \u201cI say John McCain and everybody like him is an American hero. And I say thank God that John McCain is the chairman of the [Senate] Armed Services Committee. And to anybody that suggests that John and his fellow POWs are somehow lacking in the title of being called American heroes, you shouldn\u2019t be our commander in chief, because you don\u2019t know our military.\u201d\n\nRetired Air Force Major General Charles Dunlap, now the executive director of the Center on Law, Ethics and National Security at Duke University, wouldn\u2019t go quite that far. \u201cRegardless of who the citizenry picks as its commander in chief, I believe the U.S. military would salute smartly and do its best to carry out its mission of national defense,\u201d Dunlap said.\n\nBut Dunlap made it clear that Trump\u2019s remarks made him see red. \u201cVets need not defend Senator McCain\u2019s war-hero status as in my mind it isn\u2019t open to discussion; it\u2019s an irrefutable fact,\u201d he said.\n\nRetired Air Force Captain Robert Certain was captured when he, like McCain, crashed over Vietnam. Certain ended up spending most of his 100 days of captivity inside a North Vietnamese prison, in 1973, the same year McCain\u2019s captivity ended. For Certain, Trump\u2019s comments harkened to a time dating back to World War II when war captives were considered cowards or failures for having been captured. To suggest one POW was a coward is to attack thousands of POWs, including the hundreds of the Vietnam War, Certain told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump\u2019s comments were flippant and irresponsible. He spoke about every one of us who were prisoners of war. That is a broad brush that insults several hundred people and what it means to serve,\u201d said Certain, whose B-52G was hit by two surface-to-air-missiles, leading to his capture. \u201cI have no further use for this person, and the Republican Party should throw him out.\u201d\n\nCertain was an Air Force navigator when he took part in the 1972 Christmas bombing of Hanoi, the largest bombing campaign by B-52s of the war. Also known as Operation Linebacker II, it was President Nixon\u2019s attempt to hasten the end of the war. Instead, the dangerous mission led to the capture of scores of U.S. service members, including Certain. And while it did enormous damage to the North Vietnamese\u2019s infrastructure and led to the death of at least 1,000, it did not break their will to fight.\n\nCertain noted that McCain could have ended his 5\u00bd years of torture sooner but chose to not skip ahead of other POWs because it was not his turn.\n\n\u201cThat took a great deal of courage,\u201d said Certain.\n\nCertain, along with two others, were captured immediately after their badly damaged plane crashed near Hanoi. His captors showed Certain, Major Richard E. Johnson, the radar navigator, and Captain Richard T. Simpson, electronics warfare officer, the bodies of their fallen comrades. The three were released in Operation Homecoming, a series of diplomatic negotiations that led the North Vietnamese to release 591 American prisoners of war.\n\nCertain stressed that he and other POWs are not \u201coverly sensitive,\u201d but reject broad attacks.\n\n\u201cWhen [Trump] attacks one for not having courage, it is an attack on all of us,\u201d Certain said.\n\nTaylor Stockdale, the son of Admiral James Bond Stockdale, a Medal of Honor recipient and former POW, wrote Trump a letter in response to his remarks, which was obtained by The Daily Beast. In it, Stockdale wrote that it was \u201cironic that the Presidential candidate with the most bravado and the facade of toughness, is the one who violated\u201d the underlying principle of POWs: that they stay true to themselves and their country. \u201cI would attempt to tell you how hurtful your remarks are to the men and their families who were there all those years,\u201d Stockdale wrote, \u201cbut I don\u2019t believe you have the capacity to understand.\u201d\n\nAt the press conference, Lieberman questioned Trump\u2019s patriotism, saying that the reality show star \u201cneeds me to respond to his glib and thoughtless and un-American remarks.\u201d\n\nTrump, as to be expected, has refused to apologize to McCain or his fellow POWs. In statements, by way of explanation for his outlash, he has claimed to be offended by McCain\u2019s record of vets\u2019 rights, which he says is lacking. He points to his own record (not the draft dodging and lying about it\u2014that he ignores) helping to build the Vietnam War Memorial in New York City in the early 1980s, when he served on the commission assembled by Mayor Ed Koch, and donated $1 million and helped raise $1 million more as evidence that he is a better advocate for their interests.\n\nNo one who knows anything seems to be buying that. But it so far hasn\u2019t hurt Trump much in the polls.

God bless America, Rick Perry is running for president again.\n\nPerry arrived in Addison, Texas, on Thursday to formally declare his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination\u2014again.\n\nAfter a tribute from his Precious Moments doll look-alike wife, Anita, Perry took to the lectern to discuss his humble beginnings in life, in a house with an outhouse and mother who sewed his own clothes until he reached adulthood. \u201cI\u2019ve seen American life,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen it from the red dirt of a West Texas cotton field.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke, Perry stood sandwiched between two large, bearded, sweating twins.

Many progressives have instead been strategizing around how to pull Clinton to the left without the presence of a credible liberal challenger.\n\nThe PCCC consciously echoes the Draft Warren as well as the Draft Clinton effort by calling their initiative, \u201cReady for Boldness.\u201d As part of their plan, the group is trying to organize activists in Iowa and New Hampshire to press Clinton and the other candidates on their support for economic populist ideas.\n\nBut in doing so, the group acknowledges the peculiar circumstances this election presents to progressives\u2014pushing for an agenda in an election currently devoid of a competing candidate.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton and others want support from key leaders, passionate activists, and voters \u00ad\u00ad and they'll take notice as our \u2018Ready for Boldness\u2019 campaign gains momentum and shows them the way,\u201d reads a letter that the PCCC sent out to its one million members Tuesday. \u201cBig Elizabeth Warren\u00ad style ideas are popular, and making them central to the 2016 presidential election is key if Democrats want to win.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe best way for Democrats to win the 2016 presidential election is by campaigning on bold, Elizabeth Warren\u00adstyle ideas that are popular with voters across in red, purple, and blue states,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the PCCC, in a statement accompanying the announcement. \u201c\u2018Ready For Boldness\u2019 isn\u2019t about any one candidate \u00ad\u00ad it\u2019s about shifting the political environment and ensuring the Democratic Party stands for big, bold, popular ideas.

{"entityId": 1842, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The retiring Democratic Senate leader talked a good game on immigration. That is, when he didn\u2019t. Good riddance to him.\n\nGood riddance, Harry Reid. The Senate minority leader has announced that he won\u2019t run for reelection when his current term expires in 2016.\n\nWhen he\u2019s gone, many political observers will remember Reid as a tough competitor and a skillful politician. He should also be remembered for what he leaves behind: a disconcerting racial legacy.\n\nAs opposed to those elected officials who spend their whole career loyally advocating for one group of people, Reid made his bones in racial and ethnic politics by playing both sides of the cultural divide\u2014depending on what was most politically convenient at the time.\n\nDuring the more than 30 years he represented Nevada in Washington\u2014as a member of the House of Representatives from 1983 to 1987, and in the Senate from 1987 to the present\u2014Reid was bound to stick his foot in his mouth now and then. All politicians do. The problem isn\u2019t that Reid said some dumb things. The problem is that, too often, those things were of a racial nature. He was like a little kid who liked to play with his colors.\n\nThis is the man who, according to the book Game Change by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, said privately during the 2008 election campaign that Barack Obama could win the presidency because he is \u201clight-skinned\u201d and speaks \u201cwith no Negro dialect, unless he wanted to have one.\u201d Reid apologized for \u201cusing such a poor choice of words.\u201d President Obama accepted Reid\u2019s apology, though he called the comments \u201cunfortunate.\u201d\n\nBut Reid wasn\u2019t limited to black and white. Nevada has a big Latino population; about 28 percent, according to Census figures. And he figured out early in his career that passions ran high on the issue of how Latinos impacted America\u2014demographically, culturally, etc. By the end of his career, he was known as someone who would defend Latinos against unfair attacks and scapegoating, as long as they remembered at election time.\n\nReid insisted that \u201cno sane country\u201d would decree that a child of illegal immigrants was a citizen just because he was conveniently born on its soil.\n\nYet two decades earlier\u2014sounding a lot like an early version of Rep. Tom Tancredo, the openly nativist Colorado congressman who helped make the GOP brand toxic with Latino voters\u2014Reid was busy trying to score political points with white voters by demonizing Latino immigrants as interlopers and takers. You know, the kind of people who had no claim to U.S. citizenship, either for themselves or their children.\n\nIn 1993, Reid introduced legislation that would have done away with the practice of the United States bestowing so-called \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d to the U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants. On the House floor, Reid insisted that \u201cno sane country\u201d would decree that a child of illegal immigrants was a citizen just because he was conveniently born on its soil.\n\nWhat Reid found inconvenient was the Constitution\u2014specifically the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which begins:\n\n\u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside\u2026\u201d\n\nThat was the old Harry Reid, a sort of Republican lite. Then there is the new Harry Reid, who mastered the art form of using race and ethnicity to light Republicans on fire.\n\nThere was the time, in 2006, when Republicans snuck in an amendment to an immigration reform bill declaring English the national language of the United States\u2014because well, you know, that sort of thing really goes a long way toward stopping illegal immigration. Reid, who was then Senate minority leader, called the amendment \u201cracist\u201d and said it was \u201cdirected basically to people who speak Spanish.\u201d\n\nLater that year, and again in 2007, Reid helped kill immigration reform legislation\u2014albeit discreetly\u2014because the bills included a provision for guest workers that was opposed by the Democrats\u2019s sugar daddies in organized labor. Then, with unbelievable chutzpah, Reid went before the television cameras and accused Republicans of being responsible for the outcome.\n\nIn 2010, Reid, who was then Senate majority leader, accused Republicans of being hostile to Hispanics because \u201ctheir skin\u2019s a tone darker than ours\u201d and then, in one of his most outrageous ethnic outbursts, said he couldn\u2019t imagine \u201chow anyone of Hispanic heritage could be a Republican.\u201d\n\nThen, at the end of that year, Reid\u2014who is normally a master at rounding up votes from Democrats\u2014conveniently lost, in the 11th hour, five crucial votes from Senate Democrats on a motion to call for cloture (requiring 60 votes) on the DREAM Act, a bill that would have granted a path to citizenship to undocumented young people who went to college or joined the military. The motion failed, and the DREAM Act died on a vote of 55-41.\n\nThings could not have worked out better for Reid. Since most of the \u201cno\u201d votes came from Republicans, he got to go before the cameras again and paint them as anti-immigrant obstructionists. And, at the same time, he didn\u2019t have take responsibility for passing what some conservatives considered \u201camnesty\u201d for college students. It was a win-win.\n\nImmigration was Reid\u2019s special chew toy. In the last 10 years or so, Reid has constantly depicted Republicans as anti-Latino and himself as a savior for beleaguered brown people. Granted, some Republicans are anti-Latino, which plays into Reid\u2019s hands. But that is beside the point. Reid makes it seem as if Latinos have nowhere to go, and then rewards them for their loyalty with a mixture of neglect and manipulation.\n\nHere\u2019s the impressive part: Reid did all this while not giving away the store to Latino activists who push for the legalization of millions of undocumented immigrants. Reid understood that many voters\u2014including many rank-and-file blue-collar workers and union members who normally vote Democratic\u2014aren\u2019t so keen on the idea of rewarding lawbreakers and would punish any political party that makes this happen.\n\nSome might say\u2014generously\u2014that Reid \u201cevolved\u201d over time. But you\u2019d be surprised how few times that genuinely happens in politics. In Reid\u2019s case, it might be that it was politics that led him from opposing the idea of bestowing citizenship to babies who were born in the United States to supporting the idea of giving a path to citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants because the unions that he supported so fervently moved to the left and began to advocate for immigration reform in order to beef up their membership ranks.\n\nBut is that last part of the narrative even true? Have unions really made a full and authentic conversion? The people who run these organizations must know that many of their rank-and-file members (who happen to be older and white) do not support immigration reform or welcome the entry into the normalized, legal labor market of millions of unskilled laborers who will serve as additional competition for jobs. Yet they also know that the future of at least some of these unions is Latino. What\u2019s the solution?\n\nWhat union leaders seem to have settled on\u2014since about 2000\u2014is a dishonest strategy where the leaders give a little money and sign a few letters, but keep the issue off the agenda in-house so as not to inflame or divide the members. Behind the scenes, in the negotiations that go on in Congress, labor representatives or union-friendly lawmakers work to undermine reform by removing language calling for guest workers, knowing that Republicans won\u2019t go along with reform bills that don\u2019t include it. So labor is not acting in good faith, but simply trying to fool Latinos into thinking that it\u2019s on their side when the only interests they\u2019re protecting are their own.\n\nDitto for Harry Reid. His cynical brilliance is that he is able to paint his opponents as villains and himself as a hero while getting everything he wants and not doing what he doesn\u2019t want to do\u2014all while making it seem that it\u2019s Republicans who are the bad guys.\n\nFinally, in 2012, Reid tried to rev up minority voters by referencing the donations that Mitt Romney had taken in from business and saying this on the Senate floor: \u201cIf this flood of outside money continues, the day after the election, 17 angry old white men will wake up and realize they just bought the country.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s funny. I\u2019m awake, and I see only one angry old white man.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:55.789+0000"}

It\u2019s a brilliant shade of gold in real life\u2014not the washed-out orange color it sometimes appears in photos.

They were statements. But, you know, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Trump shrugged. \u201cI answered them well and I\u2019m very happy and I really had a good time.

Some went unpaid after the contractor had financial troubles. A few never received even the paltry sum that was owed them for their dirty and hazardous efforts preceding the construction of Trump\u2019s monument to his own wealth.\n\n\u201cThey were undocumented and worked \u2018off the books,\u2019\u201d Manhattan federal Judge Charles Stewart said of the workers after they became the subject of a 1983 lawsuit. \u201cNo records were kept, no Social Security or other taxes were withheld.\u201d\n\nTrump was speaking with more firsthand knowledge than his readers likely imagined when he wrote in his 2011 book Time to Get Tough: Making America #1 Again that \u201cillegal immigration is a wrecking ball aimed at U.S. Taxpayers.\u201d\n\nHow interesting that he would choose a wrecking ball as a metaphor.\n\nThe lawsuit involving literal demolition\u2014Case 83CIV6346 in Manhattan Federal Court\u2014was brought by Harry Diduck, a now deceased dissident member of Local 95 of the House Wreckers Union. His lawyer, Wendy Sloan, says he was one of a group of like-minded workers who simply wanted \u201ca real union.\u201d They had stood to gain nothing at all for themselves as they sought to prove that Trump and his partner, along with the general contractor, conspired to cheat the House Wreckers out of pension and welfare contributions by hiring these non-union laborers.\n\nJudge Stewart initially tossed out the complaint against Trump and his partner on the grounds that the contractor was the responsible party regarding the workers. The plaintiffs appealed, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reinstated the complaint, returning the case to Judge Stewart.\n\nDuring the 16-day non-jury trial, a number of the Polish workers testified that Trump underlings had threatened them with deportation if they caused trouble. They walked in to the job from Brooklyn when a transit strike hit the city. Some of them slept at the site.\n\nTwo workers further testified that they had approached Trump in person to demand overdue wages.\n\n\u201cIn fact, we helped people and it has cost a lot of money in legal fees.\u201d\n\nTrump took the stand, even back in those days sporting a red \u201cpower\u201d tie, blue pinstriped suit, and that hair. He told the court that he almost certainly did not speak to the laborers, in part because he was fearful of venturing into so dangerous a workplace.\n\n\u201cI tend not to walk into buildings under demolition,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have to be very brave to be in a building under demolition. I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m that brave.\u201d\n\nHe added that he had no need to visit the site because \u201cYou can see it from a block away.\u201d\n\nHe further testified that in any event he could not remember ever speaking to any of the workers or even being aware there were Polish workers on the site.\n\n\u201cWhen did you learn Polish workers were on the job?\u201d he was asked by his lawyer, Milton Gould.\n\n\u201cProbably sometime after the demolition,\u201d Trump replied.\n\n\u201cDid it ever occur to you that they were illegal?\u201d Gould inquired.\n\n\u201cIt was never proven to me that they were illegal,\u201d said the developer, adding that he only heard that they might not be in the country legally \u201csometime after the demolition work.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he allowed that he had become aware that there were undocumented workers there, but only late in the project.\n\n\u201cProbably after the demolition,\u201d he said.\n\nHe apparently was referring to having retained the contractor who hired the Polish Brigade when he said, \u201cI can make mistakes. This was a mistake.\u201d\n\nThe lawyer representing the Polish Brigade had reported receiving a call from someone who identified himself as \u201cJohn Baron\u201d and said Trump was ready to hit the lawyer with a $100 million lawsuit if he kept causing trouble.\n\nTrump now acknowledged on the stand that he had used the pseudonym \u201cJohn Baron,\u201d as had one of his assistants. But Trump insisted that his use of it was only long after the completion of the Fifth Avenue tower, which became the first of many properties on which he so rapturously bestowed his real surname.\n\n\u201cLots of people use pen names,\u201d he told a reporter after he stepped down from the witness stand. \u201cErnest Hemingway used one.\u201d\n\nThe judge found against Trump, his partner, and the contractor, saying they had joined in a \u201cconspiracy.\u201d Stewart found that Trump\u2019s man on the scene, Thomas Macari, \u201cwas involved in every aspect of the demolition job.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe knew the Polish workers were working \u2018off the books,\u2019 that they were doing demolition work, that they were non-union, that they were paid substandard wages with no overtime pay, and that they were paid irregularly if at all,\u201d the judge found.\n\nStewart suggested that it would have been difficult for anyone not to notice the Polish Brigade.\n\n\u201cThe Polish workers were obvious not only in numbers but also in appearance,\u201d the judge found. \u201cIn contrast to the union workers, the nonunion Polish workers were distinguished by the fact that most of them did not wear hard hats.\u201d\n\nTrump appealed. The Second Circuit returned a complicated opinion, overturning part of the decision and referring it for \u201cfurther proceedings.\u201d\n\nThe appeals court found that if the Trump parties had not known of the Polish workers, \u201cthey should have known.\u201d According to The New York Times, Trump maintained that he was not aware there were undocumented laborers on the site.

He did le roi no favors in return\u2014but he soon came to see that that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n\nMore than 200 years ago, we included in our Constitution a provision that forbids federal officers from accepting a gift of any kind whatever from foreign interests without first getting permission from Congress (Article I, Section 9, the so-called Emoluments Clause). We borrowed the provision from the Netherlands, where it was ridiculed for being overly fussy about corruption. But we put it in both our Constitution and in that document\u2019s forerunner, the Articles of Confederation, as a defense against emulating the corrupt culture of Europe.\n\nThe unlikely source of the provision was a snuff box. A few years before the constitutional convention, the King of France gave Benjamin Franklin a diamond encrusted snuff box after his diplomatic tour. Franklin did not appear to offer anything in return, but the gift nonetheless led to concerns that Franklin might be quietly corrupted by French interests\u2014perhaps even without his knowing it.\n\nThe Americans, rigidly rejecting European custom, believed that acceptance of a luxurious gift by someone in power was itself a threat. Perhaps Franklin would be more generous toward French commercial interests simply by the operation of normal human sympathies, which to tend to be more charitable toward those who give us gifts. The framers tried to put a check on those sympathies, or at least put a block in the relationship, by requiring that Congress approve any gifts to federal officials.\n\nIronically, at the constitutional convention, Franklin was among the most outspoken in favor of anti-corruption provisions. His own lifelong experience with governments around the world had made him wary of the many ways in which officials could be tempted. James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, George Mason, and Franklin weren\u2019t wrong to be concerned about foreign powers attempting to use money to buy influence and favorable treatment.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Bill Clinton received a $500,000 personal payment from a Russian bank as payment for a speech in 2010. (In some cases, Bill Clinton directs his speaking fees to the Clinton Foundation, though there\u2019s no evidence that happened in this case.) This payment happened around the same time that Hillary Clinton\u2019s State Department was participating in the decision-making process on the legitimacy of Russian takeover of American uranium interests (the decision was made by an inter-agency body on which State was represented, but was chaired by Treasury). Many people have raised concerns that this fee, like Benjamin Franklin\u2019s snuff box, might have swayed Bill Clinton\u2019s\u2014and Hillary\u2019s\u2014general thinking toward Russian interests at the time.\n\nIn effect, the troubling morality of Citizens United has become the official morality of Clinton\u2019s defenders.\n\nOver the past several years, Bill Clinton has been given millions of dollars for foreign and domestic speeches, with the greatest number of sponsors coming from the financial industry. At the same time, he solicited and received millions of dollars from foreign and domestic interests, including. Many of the donors and sponsors had interests that were affected by State Department policies, and all of the donors, past and current, have interests that would be affected by a Hillary Clinton presidency.\n\nHillary Clinton has not addressed the issue publicly, but some of her defenders have argued that without a smoking gun, or evidence of quid pro quo, there\u2019s nothing to be concerned about.\n\nAs the framers knew, we don\u2019t need that in order to be concerned.\n\nIt\u2019s not surprising that the Clintons do not want to answer questions about foreign donations. So far, they have not addressed questions about the apparent conflict of interest, leaving the Clinton Foundation to respond. (They had company: Thomas Jefferson was so annoyed by the Emoluments Clause that he hid his own later gift from the King of France, a diamond-encrusted portrait; he had his aide take out the diamonds and sell them to pay down his debt. He was not, he wrote, going to humiliate himself by going before \u201cthe gridiron of Congress.\u201d) But as citizens we must ask these questions. Some Democrats want to ignore the issue, but love of party, as well as love of country, requires us to demand more.\n\nI am a Democrat. I will vote Democratic in the general election. But I refuse to allow my party to be silent in the face of serious accusations of conflict of interest. There are two reasons for this. I expect that the GOP candidate will use this in 2016 to make explicit that Bill Clinton\u2019s $500,000 went into his personal account, the one he shares with Hillary Clinton. Silence now doesn\u2019t change the structure of the argument.\n\nSecond, I care deeply about my party, but I believe the health of a party depends upon the openness of internal debate. I do not believe accusations of outside influence are fatal, but I believe refusing to talk about them might be.\n\nWe do not have a snuff box clause for the spouses of public officials\u2014they were not contemplated in the founding document. Instead, we have an election\u2014a \u201cgridiron\u201d of sorts. Hillary Clinton cannot undo the past, but she can help explain it.\n\nFirst, she can answer any questions about how she and her husband talk about foreign policy and domestic policy in light of the need to protect against donors using access to influence. They are not naive and must be aware of the political motives of donors: how did they, and do they, address these conflicts? Unlike campaign donations, which Hillary Clinton has to pursue under our current system of privately financed campaigns, these were avoidable situations. How did the Clintons think about, and manage, the efforts of donors and sponsors to influence them?\n\nHillary Clinton has called for a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United. But, ironically, her defenders are effectively using a Citizens United defense\u2014if there\u2019s no quid pro quo, there\u2019s no problem. Access and influence are not corrupting. In effect, the troubling morality of Citizens United has become the official morality of Clinton\u2019s defenders.\n\nShe can also act now to limit the threat of future corruption. She has indicated the Clinton Foundation will limit foreign donations. But to be fair to her constituents, the Clintons should separate themselves entirely from the Foundation, and immediately stop raising money. As a spouse and daughter seeking major donations, former President Clinton and Chelsea Clinton are rich targets for anyone seeking influence and access to Hillary Clinton, whether the donor is foreign or domestic. Hillary Clinton should also refuse to allow donations to her family members from people with interests before her: not because all donations are corrupt, but because the temptation is too great to use the channel for influence.\n\nAfter the snuff box incident, Benjamin Franklin went on to become a leader in framing key anti-corruption provisions in the Constitution, one of the most radical of its time in demanding that we protect against appearances of corruption, because appearances can too often lead to reality.\n\nHillary Clinton can do the same thing by coming forward with a full press conference, severing all familial ties to the Clinton Foundation, and proposing real, concrete solutions to the modern crisis of corruption. I\u2019m glad she is opposed to Citizens United, but a constitutional amendment reversing that decision wouldn\u2019t address the core problem of privately financed campaigns, and the ongoing conflicts the private financing system creates.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:56.628+0000"}

But on to more difficult work: Can the world-renown pediatric surgeon save the Republican Party from its self-loathing infatuation with Donald Trump?\n\nAt a Republican Bar-B-Q in Anderson, South Carolina, this week, it wasn\u2019t hard to find conservatives who are praying, literally, that the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d A Monmouth University poll released that day showed Trump leading the South Carolina primary field with 30 percent, Carson in second with 15 percent, and no other candidate in the double digits.\n\nHolding signs that said simply, \u201cHEAL,\u201d hundreds of Carson faithful turned out to see the man they have admired for years and are now hoping will lead the country.\n\n\u201cIf Trump is the anger, then Carson is the reasonable one.\u201d\n\nThanks so the massive success of his first book, Gifted Hands, and an in-your-face speech at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast where he rebuked President Obama, Carson enjoys a celebrity among evangelicals and conservatives in the way Donald Trump enjoys celebrity among everybody else. Gifted Hands has been a fixture in many homeschooling curriculums since its release in 1996. His latest book, One Nation, has sold more than 350,000 copies, more than all of the other GOP presidential candidates\u2019 books combined.\n\nAnd unlike Trump, Carson is a soft-spoken, overtly religious man. The word that resurfaces again and again in conversations about him is \u201chumble.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have known Ben Carson from his book, Gifted Hands,\u201d said Jerry Collier, who traveled to the BBQ from Six Mile, South Carolina. \u201cIn medicine, he did the impossible. In government, we think he can do the impossible, too.\u201d\n\nIrene and Andy Kelleher have also known of Carson well before he flirted with the idea of running for president. \u201cWe knew him from the Prayer Breakfast, of course,\u201d Irene said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve read his books, we know his life, he realized the American Dream coming from the bottom. He\u2019s a problem solver and he cares.\u201d\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s name came up during the dinner, which featured speeches from Carson, Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, and Senator Ted Cruz, heads shook sideways. Trump\u2019s an \u201c\u2018I\u2019 man. \u2018I.I.I,\u2019\u201d said Shirley Ellison. \u201cRemember, \u2018sin\u2019 has a big \u2018I\u2019 in the middle of it. I like that Dr. Carson is not stuck on himself. He\u2019s stuck on helping people.\u201d\n\nRela Biagiotti and her husband Tim wore \u201cCarson\u201d stickers, along with two for Cruz and Walker. Did they wish Trump was there too? \u201cNot really,\u201d they both said with a shrug. \u201cI personally just don\u2019t like his demeanor,\u201d said Rela. \u201cLet\u2019s soften yourself down a little.\u201d\n\nAs Trump has pulled away from the rest of the GOP field nationally, with his hurricane of rants, tirades, and insults, conservatives have noticed the quiet but steady ascent of Carson. The RealClearPolitics poll average shows Carson solidly in third in the 17-person field, less than one point behind a sinking Jeb Bush.\n\nWhile Trump had his 20,000-strong crowd in Mobile, last week, Carson drew 12,000 in Phoenix. No other Republican has come close to those numbers. Carson also had 2,000 in Durango, Colorado, the week before, and 2,000 in Iowa before that. And Carson has done it without taking direct aim at the front-runner, even leaving the door open to becoming Trump\u2019s vice president.\n\nOperationally, pundits dismiss Carson as disorganized and a lightweight. But in the crucial early state of South Carolina, he has assembled a team around several veterans of Newt Gingrich\u2019s winning 2012 effort there. He has visited the state more than a dozen times and, according to local operatives, is running an unconventional campaign that\u2019s bringing out people who aren\u2019t typically involved in politics.\n\n\u201cDr. Carson has spent a lot of time here\u2014his super PAC is based in North Carolina. They\u2019ve done a lot of grassroots work and raised a ton of money from individual donors,\u201d said a local Republican strategist. \u201cHe has a huge campaign bus that he drives around in. It\u2019s a little bit higher key than some of the senators who just sit in the backseat of an SUV, but it\u2019s working for him.\u201d\n\nMatt Moore, the executive director of the South Carolina Republican Party, said Trump and Carson are tapping into the same vein of anger with Washington, but going about it in totally different ways.\n\n\u201cI think Dr. Carson has carried the outsider mantle in a different form than Donald Trump,\u201d Moore said. \u201cIf Trump is the anger, then Carson is the reasonable one.\u201d\n\nBut Moore said it remains to be seen which approach, if either, will win the primary and ultimately the GOP nomination. \u201cAt some point in this campaign, there\u2019s going to be a really serious discussion about policy ideas and solutions,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now, we\u2019re in the first quarter of a football game, where name i.d. and celebrity have mattered a lot.

Literally!\u201d one ebullient Bernie fanboy shouted from the crowd of hipsters-in-uniform: Converse sneakers, crop tops, tattoos, purple hair, and ironic T-shirts.\n\nEveryone laughed, fanning themselves with fliers they\u2019d picked up at the door, their faces shiny with sweat and optimism.\n\nThey whooped and cheered as the 73-year-old Vermont senator held forth on income inequality during a livestreamed broadcast, projected onto a white bedsheet Panovich had hung from the ceiling.\n\n\u201cEnough is enough!\u201d the gravelly voiced statesman repeated again and again, reciting his campaign goals: Grow the middle class, raise the minimum wage, create jobs by rebuilding infrastructure, and raise taxes for the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires.\u201d\n\nThe Bushwick crowd knows his spiel by heart: \u201cIt is not acceptable that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer.\u201d\n\nThat kind of zero-sum thinking doesn\u2019t fly in mainstream economics, but there\u2019s nothing mainstream about Sanders \u2014and that\u2019s exactly why young progressives can\u2019t get enough of him.\n\nOne woman apologized for \u201cfrothing at the mouth\u201d as she gushed about Sanders\u2019s policies with a wild twinkle in her eye, as though he were Mick Jagger or Gandhi.\n\nHillary Clinton, on the other hand, is too mainstream.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t fire up the radicals gathered in Bushwick like Sanders does, though she has a significant lead on him in the latest national poll.\n\nThe Brooklyn hipsters are in the throes of what the media has dubbed \u201cBerniemania.\u201d\n\nMuch like Barack Obama\u2019s young supporters in 2008, they are drunk on hope imagining what Sanders could do in the Oval Office.\n\nA common refrain in the room was that Sanders didn\u2019t \u201cspout bullshit\u201d like other politicians and that his policies have been consistent over the years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve never given a fuck about politics until now.

He tells it like it is: \u2018Here are the problems and here are the solutions.\u2019\u201d\n\nSanders has been criticized by some Democrats for not addressing social justice issues as much as Clinton, but when I brought this up in conversation with Irwin, another guest interrupted.\n\n\u201cThe idea that he\u2019s not interested in social justice issues is just a smear from the Hillary campaign,\u201d said Matthew Easton, 27. \u201cIt\u2019s like when Republicans speculated whether Obama was a Muslim and said they were \u2018just asking.\u2019 It\u2019s a totally false premise. Hillary and Bernie both support #BlackLivesMatter and they both support police reform. Plus economics and social justice are linked, so by virtue of his economic stance I think Bernie goes further than Hillary.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked 26-year-old Loris Jones-Randolph why she was supporting Sanders, she fired back: \u201cBecause I\u2019m a black woman, that\u2019s why. I don\u2019t feel like any other candidate cares about my life. I worry about my life when I walk down the street, and I feel like Bernie Sanders is the only person who\u2019s created a plan to talk about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe proof is in the pudding with this man,\u201d added Jones-Randolph, who works as an administrative assistant for a church in Bushwick. \u201cIt\u2019s not with Hillary. I don\u2019t trust someone who can\u2019t show me their emails. And too much of her money is tied up with people who would rather see me dead.\u201d\n\nBrett Lehne, also 26, was panicked that unless Sanders is elected \u201cwe\u2019re going to have an income gap so incredible that we\u2019ve never seen anything like it on this planet. I\u2019m talking flying cars versus digging around in rubbish.\u201d\n\nLehne, who is employed by a union that builds and designs television and film sets, is also worried that his industry will be obsolete in 20 years as technology replaces manual labor. Sanders, he says, will save the day by raising taxes and strengthening unions.\n\nNo one in the group cares that Sanders is a longtime supporter of gun rights. Those who are anti-guns insist he\u2019ll be tough on background checks.\n\nAnd radical feminists think Sanders cares more about women\u2019s issues than Clinton.\n\n\u201cHillary has no history of being supportive of women\u2019s rights, but Bernie has been pushing for issues like this since the \u201970s,\u201d said Rachel Rosheger, 21, an art student at Cooper Union in New York City who describes herself as an anarchist.

While she thinks concentrated power is inextricably linked to corruption, she believes Sanders is a step in the right direction toward \u201cre-creating democracy in localized community and economy, and Bernie is the only candidate who has even brought up corporate corruption.\u201d\n\nWhen I asked if she wished Sanders had more fervently defended Planned Parenthood\u2019s divisive Fetal Tissue Program (he initially told CNN that Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards did the right thing when she apologized for the \u201ctone\u201d of the fetal tissue videos), Rosheger declined to answer because the issue is \u201ctoo sensitive for too many people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what that is,\u201d Dani Slocki, a 24-year-old sales manager for a public relations firm, said of the program. \u201cI\u2019ve never given a fuck about politics until now. I got into politics because Bernie is on every single page that I am on issues like police brutality and gay marriage.\u201d\n\nShe paused, confessed that she \u201csmoked some very strong weed\u201d before talking to me, then continued: \u201cAmerica is very sensitive right now.

This news cycle seems tailor-made for Rand\u2014but will he do anything more than criticize?\n\nPraise Aqua Buddha! Rand Paul, the United States senator from Kentucky and Republican presidential candidate, has been gifted a news cycle that feels designed\u2014by a certain false idol, perhaps\u2014to flatter him.\n\nFirst, the House of Representatives passed the USA Freedom Act, which, while ending mass phone data collection, extends much of the 2001 Patriot Act that Paul vehemently opposes. That position puts Paul at odds with exactly the sort of people he wants to be at odds with: more moderate primary hopefuls Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, both of whom support NSA surveillance on American citizens.\n\nPaul\u2019s preparing to milk that contrast for all it\u2019s worth by threatening to filibuster. \u201cI have until May 19th to mobilize the grassroots for this fight and I\u2019m counting on your immediate support,\u201d he told donors via e-mail Thursday. \u201cI need to know right now if I can count on you to stand with me as I filibuster the so-called PATRIOT Act.\u201d\n\nThen Paul was handed another opportunity.\n\nAs Bush campaigned on the West Coast, he was asked a fairly obvious question: Knowing what he knows now, would he have supported his brother, George W. Bush, in his decision to invade Iraq in 2003? \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d were his stammering answers.\n\n\u201cTalking about the future is more than fair,\u201d Bush said. \u201cTalking about the past and saying how you would have done something after the fact is a little tougher and it doesn\u2019t necessarily change things.\u201d He dismissed such \u201chypothetical\u201d questions.\n\nPaul, who has consistently said throughout his political career that he opposed the war in Iraq, responded in an interview with Politico: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hypothetical whether or not it\u2019s a good idea to topple secular dictators in the Middle East and hope to get a good outcome and hope that stability comes thereafter.\u201d Iraq, Paul said, was an example of such a strategy failing.\n\nPolitico reported that Paul added: \u201cI think what [Bush\u2019s] foreign policy will be\u2014and whether or not it\u2019s the same as his brother\u2019s\u2014is very important to bring up. I think they are good questions.\u201d (Mind you, this is the same Rand Paul whose campaign does not entertain questions about his isolationist father.)\n\nBush has since completely walked back his comments about Iraq. His new position is: \u201cKnowing what we know now, I would have not engaged, I would not have gone into Iraq.\u201d\n\nThen, another gift: It was revealed that George Stephanopoulos, presidential debate moderator and face of ABC News, had made contributions to the Clinton Foundation totaling more than $50,000. Paul teed off on Stephanopoulos in an interview with The New York Times, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to divorce yourself from that, even if you try\u2026there would be a conflict of interest if he tried to be a moderator of any sort.\u201d With that, Paul articulated the feelings of many on the right who feel that the so-called mainstream media has an inherent liberal (or Hillary) bias.\n\nAfter an eruption of flattering press last summer, wherein Paul was dubbed the most interesting man in politics by several mainstream publications, including TIME, intense interest in Paul and his ideas had plateaued.\n\nThe senator was, for months, the only Republican would-be candidate who was truly acting like a candidate by traveling the country, press gaggle in tow, to give speeches and raise money.

{"entityId": 1850, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "These weren\u2019t just ordinary secrets found in Clinton\u2019s private server, but some of the most classified material the U.S. government has.\n\nAfter months of denials and delaying actions, Hillary Clinton has decided to turn over her private email server to the Department of Justice. As this controversy has grown since the spring, Clinton and her campaign operatives have repeatedly denied that she had placed classified information in her personal email while serving as secretary of state during President Obama\u2019s first term. (\u201cI am confident that I never sent nor received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,\u201d she said last month.) Her team also denied that she would ever hand over her server to investigators. Now both those assertions have been overturned.\n\nHillary Clinton has little choice but to hand over her server to authorities since it now appears increasingly likely that someone on her staff violated federal laws regarding the handling of classified materials. On August 11, after extensive investigation, the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general reported to Congress that it had found several violations of security policy in Clinton\u2019s personal emails.\n\nMost seriously, the inspector general assessed that Clinton\u2019s emails included information that was highly classified\u2014yet mislabeled as unclassified. Worse, the information in question should have been classified up to the level of \u201cTOP SECRET//SI//TK//NOFORN,\u201d according to the inspector general\u2019s report.\n\nYou may have seen acronym lists like these on declassified documents before\u2014and glazed over them. This is the arcane language of the cleared cognoscenti, so let me explain what this means:\n\n\u2022 TOP SECRET, as the name implies, is the highest official classification level in the U.S. government, defined as information whose unauthorized release \u201ccould cause exceptionally grave damage to national security or foreign relations.\u201d\n\n\u2022 SI refers to Special Intelligence, meaning it is information derived from intercepted communications, which is the business of the National Security Agency, America\u2019s single biggest source of intelligence. They\u2019re the guys who eavesdrop on phone calls, map who\u2019s calling whom, and comb through emails. SI is a subset of what the intelligence community calls Sensitive Compartmented Information, or SCI. And these materials always require special handling and protection. They are to be kept in a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, or SCIF, which is a special hardened room that is safe from both physical and electronic intrusion.\n\n\u2022 TK refers to Talent Keyhole, which is an intelligence community caveat indicating that the classified material was obtained via satellite.\n\n\u2022 NOFORN, as the name implies, means that the materials can only be shown to Americans, not to foreigners.\n\nIn short: Information at the \u201cTOP SECRET//SI//TK//NOFORN\u201d level is considered exceptionally highly classified and must be handled with great care under penalty of serious consequences for mishandling. Every person who is cleared and \u201cread on\u201d for access to such information signs reams of paperwork and receives detailed training about how it is to be handled, no exceptions\u2014and what the consequences will be if the rules are not followed.\n\nPeople found to have willfully mishandled such highly classified information often face severe punishment. Termination of employment, hefty fines, even imprisonment can result.\n\nIn the real world, people with high-level clearances are severely punished for willfully violating such rules. At a minimum, those suspected of mishandling things like NSA \u201csignals intelligence\u201d\u2014intercepts calls, emails, and the like\u2014have their clearances suspended pending the outcome of the investigation into their misconduct. Any personal items\u2014computers, electronics\u2014where federal investigators suspect the classified material wound up, wrongly, will be impounded and searched. If it has TOP SECRET//SI information on it, \u201cyour\u201d computer now belongs to the government, because it is considered classified.\n\nPeople found to have willfully mishandled such highly classified information often face severe punishment. Termination of employment, hefty fines, even imprisonment can result. Yes, people really do go to jail for mishandling classified materials. Matthew Aid, a writer on intelligence matters, served more than a year in prison for mishandling TOP SECRET//SI information from the NSA, for example. The well-connected tend to avoid jail, however. Sandy Berger and John Deutsch\u2014who both served in high-level positions under President Bill Clinton, did not go to prison for mishandling TOP SECRET intelligence (though Berger got probation and was fined $50,000).\n\nWhat, then, does all this mean for Hillary Clinton? There is no doubt that she, or someone on her State Department staff, violated federal law by putting TOP SECRET//SI information on an unclassified system. That it was Hillary\u2019s private, offsite server makes the case even worse from a security viewpoint. Claims that they \u201cdidn\u2019t know\u201d such information was highly classified do not hold water and are irrelevant. It strains belief that anybody with clearances didn\u2019t recognize that NSA information, which is loaded with classification markings, was signals intelligence, or SIGINT. It\u2019s possible that the classified information found in Clinton\u2019s email trove wasn\u2019t marked as such. But if that classification notice was omitted, it wasn\u2019t the U.S. intelligence community that took such markings away. Moreover, anybody holding security clearances has already assumed the responsibility for handling it properly.\n\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton had no authority to disseminate intelligence-community information on her own, neither could she make it less highly classified (a process termed \u201cdowngrading\u201d in the spy trade) without asking permission first.\n\nIt is a very big deal and less-connected people who do this sort of thing ruin their lives, as any IC counterintelligence official can attest. During my NSA time, I saw junior personnel terminated for relatively minor infractions of security regulations. While the U.S. government unquestionably does over-classify items on the policy side, where almost everything in the Defense and State Departments gets some sort of classification stamp, not usually at a high level, intelligence reporting by its very nature is classified. If you don\u2019t want the responsibility of a high-level government position, which inevitably brings with it TOP SECRET//SI access, then don\u2019t accept that burden.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot we don\u2019t know about Hillary Clinton\u2019s Emailgate. Exactly how many emails contained TOP SECRET//SI information is unclear. We may never know since thousands of emails were already destroyed by Clinton. Who exactly placed the classified information in emails\u2014it may not have been Hillary Clinton\u2014and how did they access the information in the first place? How many of her staffers at Foggy Bottom were also using her personal server?\n\nUnderlying all this is the question of why Hillary Clinton decided to employ her own private email and server to handle so much of her official State Department business. This is, to say the least, highly irregular\u2014not to mention a violation of numerous U.S. government rules and regulations\u2014so there had to be a compelling reason to do this. What was it?\n\nThe Clinton campaign was concerned enough about the issue to send out an email blast Wednesday afternoon with the subject line: \u201cA note about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might hear some news over the next few days about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails,\u201d began the email from Jennifer Palmieri, the communications director for Hillary for America.\n\n\u201cBecause you are an important part of this team, we wanted to take a few minutes to talk through the facts\u2014we need your help to make sure they get out there. There\u2019s a lot of misinformation, so bear with us; the truth matters on this.\u201d\n\nUnderneath the greeting were several bolded bullet points, including, \u201cHillary didn\u2019t send any classified materials over email.\u201d There was also a link to a longer, 4,000+ word explanation of why Clinton used a private email address and server in her official capacity as secretary of state.\n\nThe FBI is now on the case and one hopes they will exercise due diligence in their investigation of what may be a serious leak of classified information, made worse by the fact that Clinton\u2019s personal server was wholly unencrypted for three months, leaving it wide open to exploitation by foreign intelligence services.\n\nThe number of spy services interested in the communications of the U.S. secretary of state numbers more than a hundred. Given their technical proficiency, it\u2019s na\u00efve to assume that the Russians and Chinese aren\u2019t among them\u2014a fact that John Kerry, the current secretary, recently admitted.\n\nIt\u2019s safe to assume, then, that Moscow and Beijing know what Hillary\u2019s \u201cprivate\u201d emails as Secretary of State contained. Let\u2019s hope that the American public will someday as well.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:58.640+0000"}

For those looking to understand libertarianism, or how it influences Paul, this book is a good place to start.\n\nSo Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is officially running for the Republican presidential nomination and surging in the polls.\n\nApart from his hair, the oddest thing about Paul might be that he regularly transgresses conventional partisan positions: He\u2019s a diehard free-marketer who says that same-sex marriage \u201coffends\u201d him, which makes him sound like a conservative Republican straight out of Central Casting. Yet he lead a world-shaking 13-hour filibuster attacking President Obama\u2019s \u201csecret kill list\u201d and drone policy, is regularly attacked by neocons as Neville Chamberlain 2.0, and more than any other possible 2016 hopeful of either party has underscored racial disparities in criminal justice and drug war policies.

Published in 2007, Radicals for Capitalism does a great job of explaining the ideas and groups that animated Paul\u2019s father Ron, the former congressman and Libertarian Party presidential candidate whose influence on his son is plain to see (if not absolute).\n\nTying together such disparate and often-cranky characters as novelist Ayn Rand, economist Ludwig von Mises, Nobel Prize winners F.A. Hayek and Milton Friedman, and the firebrand polemicist Murray Rothbard, Doherty chronicles how a diffuse movement formed from post-war fears over the centralization of political, business, and social power. Such centralization, libertarians worried, led inevitably to unwarranted trust in the ability of a few smart boys\u2014\u201cthe best and the brightest\u201d as they were known in the Kennedy years\u2014to call the shots in more and more aspects of our lives.\n\nWhile hardly scanting intellectual debates about post-war economics and foreign policy, Radicals for Capitalism is at its best recounting the ins and outs of fights among feuding libertarians and recounting fleeting moments of triumph, such as when future Wired magazine co-founder Louis Rossetto co-authored a 1971 New York Times Magazine cover story titled \u201cThe New Right Credo: Libertarianism,\u201d LSD guru Timothy Leary held a 1988 Beverly Hills fundraiser for Ron Paul, and Milton Friedman zinged Gen. William Westmoreland during hearings of the Gates Commission, convened by Richard Nixon to study the feasibility of all-volunteer army. After Westmoreland harrumphed that he wasn\u2019t interested in leading a force of \u201cmercenaries,\u201d Friedman asked \u201cWould you rather command an army of slaves?\u201d Radicals for Capitalism comprehensively explains the sociology of the libertarian movement and its curious-seeming emphasis on laissez-faire in personal matters as well as economic ones.\n\nIf that has whet your appetite, and you want to continue reading, a second book to check out is Arthur A. Ekirch\u2019s The Decline of American Liberalism. Originally published in 1955 with the Cold War at a full simmer, Decline offers up a unique reading of American history from the colonial period on as a struggle between forces of centralization and decentralization. A historian of militarism, Ekirch feared that in our quest to defeat the Soviet Union, we had ironically ended up valorizing the collective at the expense of the individual, ushering in an age of conformity in politics, culture, and commerce. \u201cLiberal values associated with the eighteenth-century Enlightenment\u2014and especially that of individual freedom,\u201d wrote Ekirch in the year when The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit was published, \u201chave slowly lost their primary importance in American life and thought.\u201d Big government, big business, big labor\u2014all these things were more closely interrelated than anyone wanted to acknowledge, argued Ekirch.\n\n\u2018The Decline of American Liberalism (Independent Studies in Political Economy)\u2019 by Arthur A. Ekirch Jr. (Author), Robert Higgs (Foreword). 403 p. Independent Institute. $20.82 (via Amazon)\n\nEkirch\u2019s titular liberalism refers to the 19th-century variety of the term, which is far closer to contemporary libertarianism than, say, Ted Kennedy\u2019s policy agenda. A critic of the draft and economic planning\u2014as well as of McCarthyism\u2014Ekirch worried that living in a \u201cgarrison state\u201d that is forever on war footing inevitably limited all sorts of social and economic freedoms while granting the government more and more power to surveil and regulate citizens.\n\nToday\u2019s great patriotic war, of course, is being fought not against international communism but Islamic terrorism. But to the extent that the war on terrorism is underwriting massive intervention abroad and at home, The Decline of American Liberalism is an essential guide to the connection between civil liberties and economic ones that libertarians take for granted but often seem puzzling to conventional conservatives and liberals.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:58.902+0000"}

There is prejudice and discrimination, pecking orders to which one must adhere. And those who leave the country are often ignored and forgotten.\n\nSo it is interesting that Trump has became so unpopular with the Mexican elites, who are usually content to watch from a safe distance the divisive immigration debate in the United States. If you\u2019re a doctor or lawyer or businessman in Mexico City, and you shop at Louis Vuitton and spend your summer vacations in Europe, the plight of poor and uneducated Mexican migrants in the United States must seem like someone else\u2019s problem.\n\nMexico is a country divided\u2014by political parties, generations, skin color, geography, urban vs. rural. You name it. But the deepest division has to be based on class lines.\n\nThe elites are so busy feeling superior to most of their countrymen that few of them take the time to think about how their country benefits from those who migrate to the north.\n\nIn fact, that\u2019s one thing that Americans and Mexicans have in common: Both groups are too proud to admit how dependent they are on Mexican migrants who work in the United States, and acknowledge how much those migrants contribute.\n\nAbout 12 years ago, when I was part of the editorial board of the Dallas Morning News, my colleagues and I had a meeting with the governor of one of the states in Mexico. Not only did he not acknowledge the contributions of immigrants to his state via remittances, but when I brought up the point, he actually fought me on it. That money, he said, went into private hands and not public coffers. Thus, he insisted, while helpful to individual families, it had no impact on his state\u2019s economy.\n\nI pushed back. I pointed out that, while those dollars might have started off in private hands, they don't usually stay there. They get spent\u2014at supermarkets, on utilities, in restaurants, etc. They become public dollars soon enough. And, in the process, the Mexican economy benefits.\n\nMexico gets the better end of the immigration deal since millions of people who probably couldn\u2019t be absorbed by a fragile Mexican economy instead work in the United States and send home about $25 billion a year in remittances. That\u2019s all gravy, with the only costs being whatever minimal amount the Mexican government spends to maintain a few dozen consulates in the United States.\n\nIncredibly, the Mexican elites are so proud that they actually think they\u2019re the ones keeping the country afloat. But that\u2019s not so. Without the $20 billion a year in remittances sent home by lowly Mexican immigrants toiling in the United States, Mexico would be as financially insolvent as Greece.\n\nAs for Trump, let\u2019s remember how the ruckus started. The real estate mogul got into hot water with individuals, media, and corporations on both sides on the border because, in announcing his presidential bid, he glibly characterized Mexican migrants as \u201cpeople that have lots of problems,\u201d folks who are \u201cbringing drugs\u201d and \u201cbringing crime\u201d and are often \u201crapists.\u201d\n\nIf Trump was seeking attention, it worked. Along the way, he also picked up some support from Republican primary voters.\n\nA new CNN/ORC poll finds him in second place behind Jeb Bush atop a crowded GOP presidential field. Bush is the choice of 19 percent of Republicans, and Trump is preferred by 12 percent.\n\nIn the United States, Univision, NBC-Universal, Macy\u2019s and other companies have cut ties with Trump over the comments. Ora TV\u2014a production company launched by Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and former CNN anchor Larry King\u2014also ended its business relationship with Trump. In Mexico, where Trump recently insisted he is loved by the masses, vendors are doing a swift business hocking pi\u00f1atas created in the Donald\u2019s likeness because nothing says \u201clove\u201d like a firm swat with a broken broom handle. And, more recently, Mexico pulled its contestant out of the Miss Universe Pageant.\n\nInterestingly, one of the first bursts of Mexican outrage occurred on U.S. soil. On June 18, a few days after Trump\u2019s remarks, Fher Olvera, the lead singer of the popular Mexican rock group Mana, zeroed in on the real estate mogul during a concert in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cHe said we were trash,\u201d Olvera told the sold-out crowd at Staples Center. \u201cHe said that the people who came from Latin America and Mexico are rapists, thugs, and drug dealers. Those were his words. We feel pity for this incompetent man. I have never heard a speech as violent, or as filled with hatred\u2014not since Hitler.\u201d\n\nOlvera then tried to offer a more optimistic view of the contributions of immigrants.\n\n\u201cLatinos and Mexicans came to this country to build it from the ground up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what one cabr\u00f3n said\u2014just remember that he insulted our fathers, our mothers; he insulted everyone. And that is inadmissible. When you go out to vote, which is soon, you know what you have to do.\u201d\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s a tense time for Latinos\u2014especially those in the American Southwest. Trump\u2019s remarks touched a nerve not just with Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the United States, but also with Colombians, Cubans, Puerto Ricans. Because we know the truth.\n\nBecause we can say with certainty to Trump or anyone else who cares to listen that our immigrant parents and grandparents were not criminals, rapists or drug dealers but hard-working, law-abiding laborers who loved and appreciated this country and contributed to it.\n\nAfter Olvera concluded his remarks, he launched into the band\u2019s rendition of \u201cSomos Mas Americanos\u201d\u2014a pro-immigrant anthem penned by the legendary norteno band Los Tigres del Norte that talks about \u201cAmerica\u201d not as one country but as a pair of continents. The defiant message to Trump, and his supporters: It\u2019s not just that we\u2019re as American as you. Actually, we\u2019re more American than you. And don\u2019t forget it.\n\nBut with outrage should come introspection. It\u2019s easy for Mexicans to make Trump a target. But he simply said out loud what many Mexicans who stay behind have long believed about those who fled to the north\u2014that they\u2019re the undesirables who were out of options, didn't make it, and couldn\u2019t hack it.\n\nWhich raises the question: Are Mexican elites upset at Trump for insulting their countrymen, or for stealing their lines?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:59.158+0000"}
{"entityId": 1853, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The first lady\u2019s Tuskegee commencement address was just more victim politics. How much discrimination does she face in the White House?\n\nLast weekend First Lady Michelle Obama travelled to Tuskegee University to deliver remarks to the graduating class of 2015. Tuskegee\u2019s mark in American history is significant\u2014founder Booker T. Washington was born a slave, and the original Tuskegee campus was once the site of a 100-acre plantation. Washington would become the first black guest to dine at the White House when he accepted President Theodore Roosevelt\u2019s invitation to dinner on October 16, 1901, at a time no one in America would have believed President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama would take up residence in the People\u2019s House barely more than 100 years later.\n\nCommencement addresses are typically of a joyous nature, and the First Lady did not disappoint as she started her remarks describing the remarkable achievements of the new graduates before her. This is where the tone and tenor of her remarks took a somewhat unexpected turn. Mrs. Obama rightly praised the \u201cdouble duty\u201d of the Tuskegee Airmen where she noted \u201c[A duty] to their country and another to all the black folks who were counting on them to pave the way forward. So for those Airmen, the act of flying itself was a symbol of liberation for themselves and for all African Americans.\u201d Here is where her remarks hit a bit of turbulence, which has reverberated on cable news and newspaper op-ed pages ever since.\n\nAfter describing the historic path taken to become the first African-American First Family, Mrs. Obama took to task unnamed detractors who looked down on her and her husband. In prose at once jubilant and suddenly defiant, the First Lady noted: \u201cThe world won\u2019t always see you in those caps and gowns\u2026Instead they will make assumptions about who they think you are based on their limited notion of the world. And my husband and I know how frustrating that experience can be. We\u2019ve both felt the sting of those daily slights throughout our entire lives\u2014the folks who crossed the street in fear of their safety; the clerks who kept a close eye on us in all those department stores; the people at formal events who assumed we were the \u2018help\u2019\u2014and all those who questioned our intelligence, our honesty, even our love of this country.\u201d Wow. Where to begin?\n\nWho is the they the First Lady makes reference to? Presumably racist whites; but this sounds more like an indictment of our American society at large. What are the assumptions being foisted upon these new graduates of an all-black university\u2014that Americans are bigoted and have a limited notion of blacks as being inherently inferior?\n\nWorse, Mrs. Obama says that she and her husband have felt the sting of these slights for their \u201centire lives.\u201d Does she feel insulted inside the 18 acres of the White House every day? Having served in the West Wing for four years, I can assure you that overt racism will never be tolerated in the White House today. Has she had a different experience?\n\nDoes Michelle Obama feel insulted inside the 18 acres of the White House every day?\n\nMrs. Obama is the product of two of the finest institutions of higher learning in the United States, having graduated from Princeton University and earned her law degree from Harvard Law School. Did people treat her like the help during her time in Cambridge or follow her through the stores in Harvard Square?\n\nHaving served as a Resident Fellow at Harvard\u2019s Institute of Politics in 2011 I encountered no such bigotry\u2014just respect and good-natured exchanges with my fellow faculty members and eager students. My point is that there is no such thing as the \u201cblack experience\u201d in America\u2014the First Lady\u2019s remarks give the sense that such a monolithic experience exists.\n\nThis impression is further borne out by two recent articles in The Washington Post. The first, a blog by Emily Badger, is under the banner of \u201cMichelle Obama on Being Black: \u2018There Will Be Times When You Feel Like Folks Look Right Past You.\u2019\u201d I agree with the First Lady here, but is it exclusively due to racism? I\u2019ve had people look right past me due to my politics, but I don\u2019t accuse them of being racist.\n\nBadger helpfully notes later in her piece that Mrs. Obama\u2019s remarks \u201cgave a thoughtful window into what it\u2019s like to be a black American today.\u201d So all blacks view the world from the prism of a window in which we all see contemporary American society? The comment is shocking for its insular and paternalistic view of blacks\u2014do all whites see the world from the window of white America, Ms. Badger?\n\nFinally, Richard Cohen penned a piece for the Post entitled \u201cMichelle Obama Criticized for the Sin of Being Black,\u201d in which I\u2019m sure he thought he was being sympathetic to the First Lady but instead displays much of the usual liberal white guilt that is making race relations worse, not better. After attacking Rush Limbaugh\u2014the left\u2019s favorite bogey man\u2014Cohen sniffs that this is hardly the first time Michelle Obama has come under attack from white critics who believe she has no right to be black.\n\nHardly. Mrs. Obama is an extremely intelligent woman who serves as a role model for many Americans and people around the globe. She is open to criticism, however, when she paints a negative and racist impression of the America she has been fortunate to live in and raise her family. Yes, racism still exists in America. However, it is not the country we have today that Mrs. Obama spoke of during her commencement remarks at Tuskegee. Instead, she sounded more like she was talking about the America Booker T. Washington encountered when he founded the school in 1881. I wish many who decry racism at the drop of the hat would be honest enough to admit the amazing strides we have made and continue to make as American citizens bound by our love for this great country.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:38:59.701+0000"}

There you find the split.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s not that her relationship with labor is bad, it\u2019s just that it\u2019s complicated. Other labor representatives took a softer tone when discussing their connection with Clinton.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a little unclear. I think she\u2019s been in different places on trade agreements\u2014as senator she did vote against the Central American Free Trade Agreement, but then as secretary of state she took a different position,\u201d said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff for the AFL-CIO. \u201cIt gets a little bit awkward\u2014we are at a delicate moment.\u201d\n\nAs several unions gather on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to protest upcoming congressional action to give President Obama trade promotion authority, not-presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Massachusetts) will be by their sides. They\u2019ll argue that the authority would deprive Congress of the power to block bad trade deals\u2014leading to lost jobs for American works.\n\nClinton, meanwhile, will be in Iowa, far away.\n\nIn a June 2014 interview at the Council on Foreign Relations, Clinton seemed to indicate to moderator Richard Haas she would support giving the president the ability to \u201cfast-track\u201d trade agreements\u2014the opposite of what Big Labor wants.\n\n\n\n\u201cRight now, I think that\u2019s not likely,\u201d she said of the chances the president would get that authority in time to pass the Trans Pacific Partnership. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that the treaty can\u2019t be presented and considered on its merits.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to a Hillary Clinton \u2013Jeb Bush presidential campaign,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cAnd then I hope to wake up to reality after that nightmare.\u201d\n\nShe added it would have to be sold to the American electorate as well as Congress and she hoped that case would be made. Clinton\u2019s campaign declined to comment on the TPA issue.\n\nIt\u2019s not an answer a labor organizer would love. But for unions, who else is there to pick up the torch? Certainly, not the batch of Republicans\u2014some of whom have pretty much made union-busting a state sport.\n\nYou can almost hear the collective sigh.\n\nDeep down\u2014OK, not so deep down\u2014they know they are going to be with her\u2014but that doesn\u2019t mean they are going to let her know right away.\n\nIn some ways, it\u2019s a mix of emotions broadly felt on the organized Left, the core supporters of any Democratic candidate. They feel the inevitability of Clinton; they don\u2019t want to give into it without some sort of a fight. For an example, look no further than former Clinton campaign chief\u2014and current New York City mayor\u2014Bill De Blasio. He didn\u2019t endorse Clinton on Day One, mumbling some vague concerns about wanting to see her agenda first. (As if he hasn\u2019t known her well for decades.)\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t endorsed yet, we haven\u2019t made a decision what we are going to do in the presidential race,\u201d Lee, at the AFL-CIO, said.\n\nShe added that she wasn\u2019t sure if there was a precedent for not endorsing a candidate in a presidential contest\u2014particularly in a primary race that is not competitive.\n\n\u201cWe will weigh all factors when it\u2019s clear who is and who isn\u2019t in the race,\u201d Lee said.\n\nThe last time she ran, the friction between Clinton and labor became a weapon. The Obama campaign used Clinton\u2019s connections to outsourcers to bash her.\n\n\u201cHer record raises serious questions about her ability to create and protect American jobs,\u201d Robert Gibbs, then-communications director for Obama\u2019s campaign, said at the time, according to The Buffalo News.\n\nClinton was slammed hard for her effort to bring a company called Tata Consulting, an India-based company known for sending jobs overseas, to Buffalo, New York. It was supposed to bring jobs to the region. It actually brought only 10, according to reports at the time.\n\nMiano said Clinton, like a lot of lawmakers, was looking out for corporations more than the American worker.\n\n\u201cShe has been a big supporter of these Indian companies and off shoring,\u201d Miano said. \u201cI was in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee a few years ago and a lot of the senators have that same view.\u201d\n\nMiano added the practice of hiring companies from overseas to set up small offices in the U.S. and then ship the rest of the jobs is widespread.\n\nMiano said someone like former Sen. Jim Webb (D-Virginia) would be his choice for a Democratic nominee.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to a Hillary Clinton\u2013Jeb Bush presidential campaign,\u201d he deadpanned. \u201cAnd then I hope to wake up to reality after that nightmare.\u201d\n\nOf course the mistrust between some unions and the Clintons runs deep.\n\nIn one of her books, Hillary Clinton noted labor\u2019s dissatisfaction as her husband\u2019s administration prepared to push the North American Free Trade Agreement through Congress in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cCreating a free trade zone in North America\u2014the largest free trade zone in the world\u2014would expand U.S. exports, create jobs and ensure that our economy was reaping the benefits, not the burdens, of globalization,\u201d she wrote in Living History. \u201cAlthough unpopular with labor unions, expanding trade opportunities was an important administration goal.\u201d\n\nStill, the unions are speaking to her and her staff, Lee said.\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of informal conversations with people who might be connected to the campaign,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll put it that way, at this point in time.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:00.132+0000"}

But that\u2019s where Mudhar Shawkat, a wealthy Iraqi businessman who has a long history with U.S. intelligence, is making his stand against the self-proclaimed Islamic State.\n\nShawkat, a Sunni who made his money in the telecom business and running a private security firm called Babylon Eagles, says he\u2019s fielding an autonomous, Sunni army to go toe-to-toe with ISIS and liberate the huge swaths of Iraq that the militants have conquered. And his men are ready to fight without the help of the central government in Baghdad, he says.\n\nShawkat gave his London address on disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Senate last week, when he hired a band of Washington, D.C., lobbyists to help him open a second front in his campaign. The firm is run by former Idaho senator Steve Symms and two ex-senior congressional aides. Their mission: to arrange meetings for Shawkat with U.S. lawmakers and power brokers who might bless his grand vision and help it gain support in Washington.\n\n\u201cGive me a chance to have a Sunni fight against ISIS,\u201d Shawkat told The Daily Beast in an interview, as he was shuttling between Lebanon and Erbil, in the Kurdish-controlled northern portion of Iraq. Shawkat insists that because ISIS itself is composed of Sunnis, only warriors from its own sect are prepared to slay it. That, and there\u2019s no way in hell he wants Iranian-backed Shiite militias to do the job. That would only give Tehran more sway over the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad.\n\nSo far, Iranian-backed Shiite militias have been running a ground fight against ISIS forces, supported by U.S.-led airstrikes. But in the long term, leaving the terror group\u2019s destruction to Shiites courts disaster, Shawkat said. President Obama has said he\u2019s committed to wiping out ISIS, but his plan seems to require Iran\u2019s help to do that. And now, after the recent nuclear deal with Iran, Shawkat and some of his Sunni compatriots in exile are questioning the administration\u2019s commitment to backing them up.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe want to form an army that will be led by former Iraqi officers,\u201d said Shawkat, who speaks in a smooth baritone and has near-perfect English. Those men, of course, served under Iraq\u2019s former (Sunni) dictator, Saddam Hussein. That\u2019s only the first controversial element of Shawkat\u2019s private war plan. Those officers were thrown out when the U.S. occupation force disbanded the Iraqi military in 2003, but he wants to put them back in uniform. They will lead a force of some 10,000 men who Shawkat says are ready to march once they\u2019re armed.\n\n\u201cWe want to form an army that will be led by former Iraqi officers.\u201d Those men, of course, served under Iraq\u2019s former dictator, Saddam Hussein. That\u2019s only the first controversial element of Shawkat\u2019s private war plan.\n\nShawkat was in Washington last week and said he met with more than a dozen senators and congressmen, from both parties, including the respective chairs of the Senate and House armed services committees, John McCain and Ed Royce. He\u2019s confident that one or both committees will hold a hearing this year on Sunni efforts to rid Iraq of ISIS. Spokesmen for both lawmakers didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThose 10,000 men, Shawkat said, consist of \u201cconscripts\u201d from in and around Mosul, where ISIS took over in a blazing assault last June, as well as members of the so-called Sunni Awakening that fought the Islamist militants during the U.S-led war that ousted Hussein. Current and former U.S. military officers and intelligence officials have credited their efforts with helping to turn the tide of the war in 2007 and 2008. And now, the Obama administration is encouraging more Sunnis to join in the fight, particularly through efforts by the central Iraqi government to train fighters in concert with Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province, which has been overrun by ISIS.\n\nBut Shawkat wants a separate army, cleaved off from Baghdad, and that makes his plan more radical than other would-be Sunni standard bearers who\u2019ve said they\u2019re willing to try to work with Iraq\u2019s Shiite prime minister, Haider al-Abadi.\n\n\u201cI will not work under him, because I will lose my base,\u201d Shawkat said, which he claims comes from a 1 million-strong movement that he leads called the National Salvation Front, established in 2014. Shawkat insists he doesn\u2019t want to see Iraq broken into separate countries along sectarian lines. But he\u2019s also pushing for a new autonomous \u201cSunni regional government,\u201d which he said would be temporary. Once ISIS is defeated, he said, the final boundary lines of three provinces\u2014one Kurdish, one Sunni, and one Shiite\u2014-can be drawn.\n\nShawkat is eyeing his friends in Washington warily these days. \u201cHe\u2019s very concerned that the U.S. sees the Iranians as an ally to get rid of ISIS. That would be a major mistake,\u201d Shawkat\u2019s spokesperson, Whitley Bruner, told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is a Sunni-on-Sunni fight.\u201d\n\nBruner, a former CIA operations officer and longtime Middle East hand, said that the commitments from the 1,700 officers and 10,000 soldiers to fight ISIS were real, and that Shawkat has also been looking for support among \u201cregional powers,\u201d whom he declined to name. Shawkat himself said that Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates were two countries that could be helpful in acquiring weapons for the new militia, and indicated that U.S. approval of such a transaction would help to speed it along.\n\nShawkat is not an unknown entity in Washington. He was a senior leader in the Iraqi National Congress, a Hussein-opposition group that had bipartisan backing in the U.S. Congress and received funding from the CIA, the State Department, and the Pentagon. Shawkat insisted he was never a \u201cdeputy\u201d to the INC\u2019s notorious leader, Ahmed Chalabi, as has been widely reported. Shawkat was already running a group opposed to Hussein of his own in 2002 when he was brought together with Chalabi, he said, \u201cunder heavy persuasion of Department of State and Pentagon.\u201d They split in 2004, but remain on good terms, Shawkat said. \u201cDr. Chalabi remains a personal friend, but we differ on political matters and methodologies.\u201d\n\nDavid Mack, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who was once in charge of the U.S. government\u2019s interactions with Iraqi opposition forces, described Shawkat as a politically \u201cflexible\u201d man whose business acumen mirrored his political skills.\n\n\n\nMack said he met Shawkat in the spring of 1999, when Shawkat was living in exile in Vancouver. He\u2019d come to a large conference for Iraqi opposition groups in New York, and stood out as someone who \u201chad a good sense of the role the Iraqi private sector could play\u201d in efforts to prepare for a post-Hussein nation, Mack told The Daily Beast. \u201cHe\u2019s a entrepreneurial personality. Sometimes that makes for good politicians.\u201d\n\nThat also may have been what drew him to Chalabi. \u201cHe realized that one of the things he needed in the INC was a prominent Iraqi Sunni figure, and he eventually settled on Mudhar for that role,\u201d Mack said.\n\nBruner, Shawkat\u2019s current spokesman, was the man who first recruited Chalabi to work for the CIA, in 1991. That led to the formation of the INC, which later provided provided U.S. intelligence with information about Hussein\u2019s supposed weapons of mass destruction program\u2014intelligence that was later discredited. \u201cWithout Chalabi there would have been no war,\u201d journalist Aram Roston wrote in his book on the notorious Iraqi, The Man Who Pushed America to War.\n\nShawkat\u2019s connections to Chalabi may be the least of his challenges in persuading Washington that he\u2019s the right man to fight ISIS. That\u2019s because there are several Iraqi Sunnis making that claim, including at least three other individuals and groups who have hired lobbyists of their own in the past year, according to disclosure records. (There\u2019s also an effort underway to bankroll Iraq\u2019s Kurdish fighters, by Republican mega-donor Foster Friess.)\n\nOne of the Sunni players, Sheikh Abdalrazzaq Hatem al-Suleiman, a prominent tribal leader, met with members of Congress during a week-long visit in May. He also sat down with Royce, the House Armed Services Committee chair, with whom Shawkat met. At the State Department, Abdalrazzaq spoke with Brett McGurk, President Obama\u2019s special envoy to the international coalition to conquer ISIS.\n\nThe sheikh, who fled Iraq after ISIS destroyed his home in Anbar province and now lives in Jordan, leads a tribe of some 300,000 who are also prepared to fight the militants, Jonathan Greenhill, his representative in Washington, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe sheikh is ready to produce his tribesmen now,\u201d said Greenhill, a former senior operations officer with the CIA.\n\nAfter his visit to Washington, Abdalrazzaq obtained a proclamation from the Al-Anbar Provincial Council in Iraq, supporting his plan to pull together Kurds and Shiites\u2014not backed by Iran\u2014and train them to fight ISIS, along with Iraqi Sunni fighters. Unlike Shawkat, the council is willing to work with the central government in Baghdad to train the fighters. The council\u2019s training plan also has the backing of the Obama administration.\n\nWhat\u2019s shaping up in Washington now may be a fight to see which of the various Sunni players has the best plan, or at least can undermine the others. Among the groups is another coalition of Sunni tribal chiefs, as well as prominent figures from Iraq\u2019s Nineveh province. If anything united them, it\u2019s their varying degrees of distrust of Baghdad and its Iranian allies.\n\n\u201cOver the past 12 years, by far more Sunnis have been killed by these Iranian-backed Shiite militias than by al Qaeda or ISIS combined, while the Iraqi central government turns a blind eye,\u201d Mark Alsalih, a prominent Sunni lobbyist in Washington and the president of the Iraq Stability and Security Program, composed of citizens and tribal sheikhs, told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe various groups want to strengthen their own hands while the Obama administration backs Abadi and leans on the central government to solve Iraq\u2019s problems and defeat ISIS\u2014hence the furious lobbying efforts of late by so many Sunnis. But all their work may reveal more about their various plans\u2019 weaknesses than their strengths, experts said.\n\n\u201cThe seemingly endless parade of Sunni leaders coming to Washington seeking arms and other support to equip bands of fighters speaks to two critical, reinforcing problems in Iraq today,\u201d Kenneth Pollack, a former CIA analyst who worked on Iran and Iraq military issues and is now a senior fellow at the Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cFirst, the Sunni leadership is fragmented and lacks a unified command structure that could organize a fight against Da\u2019ish or conduct meaningful negotiations with Abadi,\u201d Pollack said, using an Arabic acronym for ISIS. \u201cSecond is the persistent sluggishness of the Iraqi government (and its U.S. allies) in arming and training willing Sunni fighters on their own.\u201d\n\nA kind of stalemate has ensued, Pollack said, with the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad arguing that it needs to take things slow, because the Sunnis that want arms are being led by \u201cfreelance leaders whose allegiance is unknown,\u201d and the Sunnis in terms demanding arms to \u201ccircumvent a government they believe is either unwilling or unable to lead the fight against Da\u2019ish in the Sunni heartland.\u201d\n\nIn the days when the U.S. forces were fighting and dying in Iraq against ISIS\u2019s predecessor, U.S. officials may have been more willing to roll the dice on some of these freelance leaders.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of tribal leaders and municipal leaders who have clout. And in the Bush era they all would have been taken rather seriously,\u201d Jonathan Schanzer, a former terrorism analyst with the Treasury Department and now the vice president for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cRight now, my sense is that they are being viewed by the Obama White House as people who could drag America back into conflict or waste more of our treasure on a hopeless cause,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sympathetic to them. But I think they need to somehow organize internally better before approaching this Congress and this White House.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, Shawkat said he is planning to come back to Washington in the fall, hopefully as a witness at one, maybe two congressional hearings. There, he might have his best chance yet to pitch his war plan.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:00.302+0000"}

Why it\u2019s all been leading to his Tuesday morning announcement.\n\nIt was the Saturday before Thanksgiving 2013, two years after Chris Christie had decided against running for the Republican presidential nomination, a few weeks after he had won reelection, in a landslide, as governor of New Jersey, and two months before Bridgegate would threaten to permanently sideline his political ambitions.\n\nIn the Morristown Diner, there was a vague sense that the tide was turning for the beginning of Christie\u2019s second term, but then it could\u2019ve just been my company: Richard Merkt, a ghost from Christie\u2019s past\u2014and one who had reason to dislike the Republican star. \u201cHe\u2019s basically someone who runs for a position so that he has that as a stepping stone to the next position,\u201d Merkt complained.\n\nChristie and Merkt had run for office together\u2014the state Assembly, 1995\u2014and lost, badly, some said because of Christie\u2019s reputation in their north Jersey district. Christie had been elected to a local office, county freeholder, just a few months before he decided to run for the Assembly, leaving people with the impression that he was a young man in too much of a hurry who didn\u2019t respect the rules and customs of the arena he was playing in.\n\nWorse, he had starred in a campaign ad in which he lied about a beloved neighborhood political figure. He would ultimately lose a libel suit over the matter and be forced to apologize in the local paper.\n\n\u201cHe became the U.S. attorney for the same exact thing: as a stepping stone for the next position,\u201d Merkt claimed. \u201cIs there any doubt in your mind that his goal as governor is to set himself up for a run for federal office?\u201d\n\nThere was little doubt in anyone\u2019s mind\u2014then.\n\n\u201cHe needs a future after 2017,\u201d a former Republican legislator who knew Christie early in his career told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way for him to remain politically relevant.\u201d\n\nBut then the state Transportation Committee chairman, Assemblyman John Wisniewski, released a trove of documents in January 2014 relating to the unexplained closure of access lanes to the George Washington Bridge the previous September, implicating as orchestrators of the scheme top members of Christie\u2019s Cabinet. Certainty about Christie and the obvious trajectory of his political career evaporated as quickly as it formed when had burst onto the national scene with his defeat of Obama favorite Jon Corzine in 2009.\n\nThe following 16 months of Christie\u2019s life would be a series of state and federal investigations of varying degrees of legitimacy, late-night punchlines, budget woes, sinking poll numbers, and attempts to regain the friendly curiosity of the national media who had cooed at him throughout his first term.\n\nIn May, two former Christie aides were indicted and one pleaded guilty, as the result of an investigation by U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman. Christie claimed, in an interview with Fox News, that \u201cthe U.S. attorney said in his press conference a few weeks ago there will be no further charges in the bridge matter. He said it affirmatively three or four times.\u201d As the Star-Ledger\u2019s Tom Moran points out, Fishman did not say that. He said, in fact, that the investigation is ongoing. \u201cIt\u2019s like the end of Downton Abbey,\u201d Fishman joked. \u201cYou have to wait for a whole \u2019nother season.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s as close to \u201ccleared\u201d as Christie is likely to get, and with that as the uncomfortable\u2014if little-noticed\u2014backdrop, he is moving on.\n\nChristie will announce on Tuesday that he is running for president. It\u2019s the outcome anyone who has ever seen, heard, met, worked for, loved, or hated Christie expected of him\u2014and no scandal, real or imagined, blown out of proportion or criminally overlooked, could have prevented him from reaching for this next brass ring.\n\nChristie will deliver his remarks at 10:30 a.m. at Livingston High School, where he was thrice elected president before he graduated, 35 years ago this month. Those with knowledge of the event say they expect it to be held in the round, as his popular town hall meetings are, with his family and friends surrounding him.\n\nChristie\u2019s camp is banking on his ability to outfox the primary competitors who currently trample him in the polls with his communication skills. In the debates in particular, they are hoping voters will see him live up to the campaign slogan\u2014#TellingItLikeItIs\u2014and outshine the less gifted orators onstage.\n\nAs recently as Friday, Christie had claimed he had not yet made a decision for 2016 (#TellingItLikeItIs), but the truth is, no one surrounding him has ever had any doubt. They are optimistic, the people he employs, and they claim that they are taking the long view, trying not to get too hung up on any one poll or story. \u201cNot to beat a dead horse,\u201d one source close to the campaign said, \u201cbut if you look at this time [in the cycle] in 2008? We would have had Rudy Giuliani vs. Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nBut the most obvious reason for Christie 2016 is that he has no other option. He is limited to two terms as governor, meaning his options if he didn\u2019t run would be go back to appellate and securities law, or maybe get a TV show. The worst thing that could happen for Christie now that he\u2019s running is defeat, and he can always\u2014especially given his relatively young age of 52\u2014run again.\n\n\u201cHe needs a future after 2017,\u201d a former Republican legislator who knew Christie early in his career told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way for him to remain politically relevant.\u201d\n\nThe longtime friend of the governor\u2019s agreed. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t see a Plan B,\u201d the friend said. \u201cThat\u2019s one thing: Christie always has a Plan B and a Plan C.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in his DNA,\u201d a longtime friend of Christie\u2019s told me. Politics is a career for him... He loves his country, he loves his state. He just wants to do this. I dont think there\u2019s any grand, greater reason than that.\u201d\n\n\n\nImagining Christie\u2019s presidential campaign back in 2013, Merkt was characteristically critical. \u201cChris Christie\u2019s vision is, \u2018I Can Win,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThe question is, where would you lead the nation?

{"entityId": 1858, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "With a presidential run in the cards, and as her email controversy continues to rumble, Hillary Clinton is assembling a tried-and-trusted set of defenders around her.\n\nCall them the four horsemen\u2014or maybe it\u2019s five or six; the number keeps growing\u2014of Hillary Clinton\u2019s media apocalypse.\n\nThey include old Clinton hands like James Carville, Lanny Davis, Karen Finney, and Kiki McLean\u2014plus erstwhile recording industry lobbyist Hilary Rosen and antagonist-turned-acolyte David Brock\u2014who are regularly leaping onto their steeds and riding to the defense of the unannounced Democratic presidential frontrunner.\n\nWhile Clinton is hardly a damsel in distress, she lacks a formal campaign organization that can rapidly respond to damaging publicity. Thus, in the past two weeks, since \u201cEmail-gate\u201d was launched with an above-the-fold front-page story in The New York Times, the former secretary of state\u2019s ex-officio champions have been a near-constant presence on cable and broadcast television.\n\n\u201cIf I were the crisis manger, doing what I do, Hillary would have been out within hours with what she ended up saying, which was: \u2018In retrospect, I probably shouldn\u2019t have done it that way,\u2019\u201d said Washington lawyer Davis, who\u2019s been pals with the once and future presidential candidate since their Yale Law School days four decades ago, and toiled in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House as a special counsel managing reactions to Whitewater and other political scandals.\n\n\u201cBut without a campaign structure to support her, it took her eight days to respond,\u201d Davis added. \u201cIn the era of the 1990s, that is not a long time. But in the era of the Internet, eight minutes is a long time.\u201d\n\nDavis and the others have been spending recent days mixing it up with Clinton\u2019s journalistic critics, attesting to her legal and ethical propriety regarding her use of a private email server for official government business, and otherwise attempting to change the subject to the perfidy of her Republican \u201cwitch-hunters.\u201d\n\nSome of Hillary\u2019s champions\u2014like Carville and Davis\u2014say they are freelancing without benefit of approved talking points; others\u2014like Finney, McLean, and Rosen\u2014say they check facts and nuances with Hillary\u2019s staff before going on TV; Finney and Rosen say they participated in a conference call hosted last week by Clinton press aide Nick Merrill on the subject of Hillary\u2019s emails, while Carville and Davis say they pointedly avoided it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a conference call kinda guy,\u201d said Carville, who defended Hillary this past Sunday on ABC\u2019s This Week With George Stephanopoulos and on Andrea Mitchell\u2019s MSNBC program a week ago Monday. \u201cI\u2019d rather have barbed wire stuck up my butt than get on a conference call.\u201d\n\nDavis, who estimates that he has made at least a dozen email-related television appearances in defense of his old friend, has a different reason for not coordinating with Team Hillary.\n\n\u201cI never talk to anyone, and I never talk to her, about what I should be saying,\u201d Davis explained. \u201cBecause I tell everyone when I\u2019m on the air that I am just a friend of Hillary Clinton, not an official spokesman. I\u2019m not told what to say. So if I say something stupid\u2014which I sometimes do\u2014they [Clinton\u2019s team] can say, \u2018Lanny\u2019s on his own.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019s March 8 appearance on Fox News Sunday arguably fit that description, when he told host Chris Wallace that an independent third party should examine Clinton\u2019s emails and private server.\n\n\u201cThere can be a neutral party to review all these records,\u201d Davis said, predicting that Clinton would agree to turn them over. \u201cIf the State Department asks, she will say yes. If there\u2019s a subpoena, she must say yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a conference call kinda guy. I\u2019d rather have barbed wire stuck up my butt than get on a conference call.\u201d\n\nThe resulting headline in The Wall Street Journal, \u201cClinton Ally Backs An Independent Review in Email Controversy,\u201d was hardly on-message\u2014especially when Clinton herself made clear at her United Nations press conference two days later that she had no intention of cooperating with such a fishing expedition.\n\nSimilarly, Carville\u2019s appearance on This Week produced arguably unhelpful news stories with his suggestion that \u201cconvenience\u201d\u2014Hillary\u2019s stated reason for exclusively using a private email account while secretary of state\u2014was not the sole explanation.\n\n\u201cI suspect she didn\u2019t want Louie Gohmert rifling through her emails,\u201d Carville said on television, referring to the right-wing Republican congressman from Texas, \u201cwhich seems to me a kind of reasonable position for someone to take.\u201d Carville\u2019s comment was widely interpreted to mean that Clinton was deliberately dodging scrutiny from Congress.\n\nCarville, who became an international celebrity, the famed \u201cRagin\u2019 Cajun,\u201d as Bill Clinton\u2019s chief campaign strategist in 1992, told The Daily Beast that he\u2019s being very selective about his pro-Hillary media hits.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll do anything I can to try to help her, but I\u2019m not doing 200 television appearances. I don\u2019t have the time,\u201d he said. \u201cI might get 200 phone calls. I think what I have is a valuable historical perspective.\u201d\n\nCarville, who recently signed on as a columnist for David Brock\u2019s liberal-leaning Media Matters press criticism site, added: \u201cRight now, I\u2019m kinda working on \u2018The Anatomy of a Clinton \u201cquote\u201d Scandal\u2019 which I might post in the next week...It\u2019s always the same thing. The Republicans leak it to the press, generally The New York Times...and then the press walks it back. It started with the ethics Whitewater scandal, then Filegate, Travelgate, Pardongate, Benghazi...My question that I\u2019m gonna pose is, \u2018Why do they [the media] keep falling for that?\u2019\u201d\n\nBrock\u2014who demanded that the Times correct its email scoop--debated the issue on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, and won a minor concession from the paper\u2019s public editor, Margaret Sullivan, that the initial story, while valid, \u201cwas not without fault\u201d\u2014declined to comment to The Daily Beast.\n\nAs a writer for The American Spectator during the Clinton administration, he exposed the Paula Jones scandal, which ultimately led to impeachment proceedings. Later Brock apologized to the Clintons, renounced his former career as a self-described \u201chit man\u201d for the vast right-wing conspiracy, and became an enthusiastic booster of Hillary\u2019s political prospects.\n\nLongtime Democratic activist Hilary Rosen, who on the night of the UN news conference discussed Clinton\u2019s emails on PBS\u2019s NewsHour and on CNN where she's a paid contributor, described her role this way: \u201cMy job isn't to defend Hillary, it is to call it like I see it. I believed her, though, thought her explanation was reasonable, and was happy to say so. I thought this whole issue was nothing but filling a vacuum before she announces. And I really don't think that 20 months from now, voters will make a choice based on emails.\u201d\n\nKaren Finney, who served in the Clinton White House as the first lady\u2019s deputy press secretary and later was communications director of the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cI felt like I wanted to do this if I could be a part of helping get the correct information out there. I believe in her. I think she would make a great president.\u201d\n\nPublic relations consultant Kiki McLean, meanwhile, echoed: \u201cI\u2019m somebody who believes in her leadership, and I also believe that the American people deserve to know the facts.\u201d\n\nMcLean, who has argued Hillary\u2019s case during three appearances on MSNBC over the past couple of weeks, added: \u201cMy only concern is that the expectations of the media, from a pure process standpoint, be reasonable.\u201d\n\nLast week\u2019s televised spectacle at the UN, where Clinton and her sole press aide, Nick Merrill, confronted a mob of nearly 300 reporters in front of a tapestry of Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica,\u201d demonstrated that in the limbo period of a pre-campaign, the demand for quick answers far exceeds the Clinton staff\u2019s ability to provide them.\n\n\u201cThe media is setting up their expectations\u2014and not just the media, by the way\u2014but other people who would apply their analysis to the performance of a team that doesn\u2019t exist yet,\u201d said McLean, an adviser to Hillary\u2019s 2008 campaign and another former communications director of the DNC.\n\n\u201cYou and I both know that a story isn\u2019t fully formed in its first day, and there are a lot of contributing factors,\u201d McLean said, explaining why Hillary seemed so slow in pushing back on the email flap. \u201cOne was a news vacuum right after CPAC [the headline-generating Conservative Political Action Conference], while the Republicans had all gone home that week. Vacuums have to be filled, and the media is frequently happy to have Hillary be the filler. That\u2019s not a positive or a negative. That\u2019s just the way it is.

{"entityId": 1860, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "When people are shouting \u2018white power\u2019 at his rallies and Trump is endorsed by the Daily Stormer, the joke is over.\n\nIt has been more than two months since Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president, and slowly but surely the entertainment factor as been on the wane and the fear factor has been on the rise.\n\nAs his poll numbers steadily keep him in a comfortable first place in the crowded GOP field, and he packs stadiums\u2014receiving raucous applause in Alabama and along the Mexican border\u2014his fiery and divisive rhetoric has taken on a new meaning. His positions have now become the focal point of the GOP field and all candidates must respond to Trump before they can proceed.\n\nWhat he and his supporters say can no longer be considered a joke. During his rally in Mobile, Alabama, screams of \u201cwhite power\u201d could be heard from the audience. And last week, two white ex-cons from Boston beat up a homeless Hispanic man, and upon their arrest they told the police, \u201cDonald Trump was right, all these illegals need to be deported.\u201d\n\nIn response to the attack, Trump said, \u201cI will say that people who are following me are very passionate. They love this country and they want this country to be great again. They are passionate.\u201d He did not initially decry their actions, but later stated on Twitter that he thought the attack was \u201cterrible.\u201d\n\nThe joke is over. The horrors of a Trump presidency should not be lost on anyone. His immigration plan calls for the deportation of the estimated 11-12 million undocumented immigrants who have entered via our southern border. This position has definitely stoked the fire of Americans who are not pleased with our immigration policies, but an America that rounds up and forcefully removes a race or class of people is most certainly a dystopian nation that encourages lawlessness and anarchy.\n\nIf these policies were enacted, what would prevent American citizens from destroying the documentation of legal Hispanic immigrants, and forcefully deporting them or using the threat of deportation as leverage for rampant abuse? Arizona already has the \u201cshow me your papers\u201d provision of SB 1070 that essentially treats Hispanics as illegal until proven innocent.\n\nEven his campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d stokes a nationalistic fervor that makes some Americans feel as though they are under attack.\n\nThis reality might seem farfetched, but in fact America has traversed this territory before. My forebears in South Carolina were free persons of color since the late 1700s and lived as second-class citizens, but in the 1860s prior to emancipation, certain municipalities started requesting that FPCs show their papers or be forced into slavery. Many FPCs had never needed papers before, so they regularly went about their lives without documentation.\n\nBut overnight this changed. Without papers you were assumed to be a slave, and white America would see to it that you were \u201creturned\u201d to a life of slavery. Additionally, it was illegal to educate blacks in South Carolina, so some FPCs were illiterate, and therefore even if they had documentation it was difficult for them to prove the papers\u2019 legitimacy. Many FPCs ran for their lives, and attempted to flee the state, but countless of them were rounded up and forced into slavery.\n\nEssentially, even though 150 years may have passed, too many Americans are still advocating for oppressive, segregationist, and pre-Civil War policies. But this time these Americans may have decided to direct most of their hatred towards a different shade of people.\n\nWhen you examine Trump\u2019s unilateral and authoritarian foreign policy positions more red flags are raised. Invading a country to take its oil is something America has already attempted with dire consequences. Does he honestly think that he can force Mexico to pay for the construction of a wall along our border?\n\nConcerning women\u2019s issues and basic respect for another person he is equally troubling, and the rekindling of his vile and sexist war of words with Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly shows this. He again called her a bimbo and demeaned her physical appearance. If these were merely the comments of a clown, we could brush them off and ignore them. But when it is a billionaire clown that is the GOP presidential front-runner, we all should be incredibly concerned. If this man had the authority to create and approve laws, what would his policies regarding women\u2019s rights look like?\n\nEven his campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d stokes a nationalistic fervor that makes some Americans\u2014predominately conservative white Americans\u2014feel as though they are under attack from ruinous anti-American elements that need to be defeated. Yet if American greatness existed prior to the 1960s, I am sure that countless other Americans would not want to return to that era, which sure wasn\u2019t very welcoming for them.\n\nIn another time and another place we would probably view Trump\u2019s rise to prominence along a fascist trajectory similarly to the European movements of the early 20th century and discuss his every move as a cautionary tale, but as of yet we have not. But we should pay attention when the Daily Stormer, a conservative, Neo-Nazi and white nationalist publication, endorses Trump for president, as it did Tuesday.\n\nThis is alarming. Yet I wonder if this lack of alarm exists because his language is not foreign to American society. We have always proclaimed ourselves to be a meritocratic society where anyone can work his way to the top with hard work, but parallel to this narrative was the reality that persons of color have always had limited opportunities for advancement. Therefore, it has always been commonplace to demean the poor and/or persons of color because they supposedly had \u201cearned\u201d their lower station in life due to an assumed predisposition toward sloth or some other negative activity.\n\nAs long as America ignored its oppressive structures then people had an unlimited license to demean and ridicule people who they felt had \u201cearned\u201d less than they. It now became acceptable to fabricate negative narratives to explain an oppressed group\u2019s lower station in life, and Trump is invoking this cultural trait to a dangerous effect.\n\nTrump is rallying his supporters around a narrative of nationalistic pride, collective frustration, and dehumanizing language regarding persons of color and women, and this cannot be a platform American society can embrace again. Our collective fear concerning his candidacy should be about what era of America\u2019s past he wants to return us to in his quest to \u201cMake America Great Again.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:02.421+0000"}

{"entityId": 1862, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "You thought Clinton-Obama 2008 was bad? Wait until a white guy steps in a woman\u2019s path and attacks her integrity.\n\nYou\u2019ve got to admit it was kind of a stroke of genius for Joe Biden to have that \u201csecret\u201d meeting with Elizabeth Warren over the weekend. The mind of course jumps instantly to the prospect of a Biden-Warren ticket, even to the idea that Biden could, when announcing his candidacy, say, next month, also announce that Warren will be his running mate.\n\nGame-changer is a hoary expression in this town, so forgive me, but that really would be one. I\u2019d guess Biden would go instantly from his current 13 percent to at least twice that. His ego would have to adjust to having a running mate who is more beloved than he is and who draws crowds about four or five times the size of his. But even something short of an official alliance, a nudge-wink implication that Warren is somehow on Team Biden, makes him a much more serious player.\n\nThe big Biden question is whether he\u2019s just preparing in case Clinton becomes felled by scandal or \u201cscandal,\u201d or whether he decides in the near future that she\u2019s damaged enough already that he might as well hop on the bus and see where it takes him. The former course of action, well, that\u2019s all right; given what appear to be Bernie Sanders\u2019s general-election limitations and the fact that Martin O\u2019Malley isn\u2019t exactly setting the nation on fire, it seems a reasonable thing for him to be thinking about.\n\nBut what if he just decides the hell with it, I\u2019m running? A Biden vs. Clinton primary battle could be\u2014and if Biden manages to win a couple of primaries, most certainly would be\u2014far more acrimonious than the Clinton-Barack Obama fight of 2008.\n\nWhy? Three reasons. The first has to do with race and gender and history. When Clinton announced in 2007, she was going to be the first woman president. Then Obama got in, and he was going to be the first black president. He totally trumped her on the history-maker scale. I realize not everyone saw it that way, but in general terms, given the, ah, special racial history of this country, and given the role the Democratic Party played in changing that history for the better, Obama had the larger and more morally urgent historical claim to make in the minds of most Democrats and liberals. The woman would have to wait, as women so often do.\n\nWell, she\u2019s waited. Not that she had any choice in the matter, but she did. And now, to a lot of Democrats, it\u2019s her turn. The party can make history twice in a row. Imagine!\n\nHe\u2019s going to have to run a campaign that says, sub rosa: \u201cI\u2019m a stronger and safer nominee because she\u2019s corrupt.\u201d\n\nSo now, an old white guy is going to saunter in and step on that? And if he\u2019s going to do it, he\u2019s not going to be able to do it politely, which brings us to reason number two why this would get ugly. Biden is not going to get anywhere with a campaign that says: \u201cI have better ideas than Hillary Clinton does,\u201d because he probably doesn\u2019t, and she has perfectly fine and laudable ideas, even if a lot of liberals don\u2019t want to admit that yet.\n\nNo. He\u2019s going to have to run a campaign that says, sub rosa: \u201cI\u2019m a stronger and safer nominee because she\u2019s corrupt.\u201d Because that\u2019s the only argument, is it not? He can\u2019t out-populist her, really, even with Warren promoting him\u2014he\u2019s been in politics for 40 years and he\u2019s always been a pretty conventional establishment liberal on economics. He can maybe say he has more experience, but she\u2019s got plenty of that, and it\u2019s not a deficiency; it would be like Tim Duncan saying \u201cI have more experience than LeBron James.\u201d Yeah, you do. So what?\n\nBiden would have no choice but to build a run around the idea that she\u2019s too risky. He or his surrogates will need to press the idea that the party could nominate Clinton and then next fall, Trey Gowdy finds that Holy Grail email that brings the whole thing crashing down. In other words, his candidacy is going to have to be built around what is in essence a Republican Party talking point.\n\nAnd if he goes for the jugular, the Clinton team will surely respond in kind. They\u2019re not wallflowers, those folks. They know how to fight. And they\u2019d be fighting on behalf of the millions of Democratic women out there for whom it\u2019s Clinton\u2019s time. That\u2019s her emotional rationale. But Biden has an emotional rationale, too: Beau. Where women will be protective of Hillary, Biden\u2019s backers will be protective of him, too, because of his war hero son\u2019s death.\n\nAs I said above, Biden would have to win a few primaries for this to happen. If he gets in and loses the first four primaries and she wins them, then he\u2019s out, and so is everyone else, with the possible exception of Sanders, who is the kind of candidate who might hang around for a while to make his point. But if he wins a couple and finishes well enough in others to collect a respectable amount of proportional delegates, he could well stick around until at least the Pennsylvania and Delaware primaries, which are scheduled for April 26.\n\nThat\u2019s a long fight, and it brings us to our third reason why this would be worse than 2008. The media would be rooting for and trying to foment Democratic chaos every step of the way. Of 2008, I do think it\u2019s fair to say that the press liked Obama and kinda wanted to see him win, for the historical reasons noted above. \u201cAmerica Elects First Black President\u201d was the best of the possible story lines on offer and it made (most) people feel good about the country. Well, today, the media want to see Clinton lose, it\u2019s pretty obvious, and so they\u2019d do everything they could to promote Biden and turn the campaign into all-out war. And in contrast, the press likes Biden, and reporters will cut him lots of slack and lash into her for daring to attack Biden after the personal tragedy he\u2019s suffered.\n\nAnd by the way, what would Obama do in a Biden-Clinton match? Those comments by Josh Earnest on Monday were strange. He ladles praise on Biden and says he \u201cwouldn\u2019t rule out the possibility of an endorsement during the Democratic primary.\u201d Really? He\u2019d knife Clinton like that? The Clintons delivered pretty well for him in 2012 as I recall.\n\nBesides, powerful people don\u2019t endorse people who are nearly 40 points behind in the polls, as Biden currently is to Clinton. The normal thing for a spokesman to say in such circumstances is something like \u201cthe president has enormous respect for both Clinton and Biden and will respect whatever decision...\u201d and that kind of thing, but Earnest went well beyond that.\n\nI suspect Biden is thinking only about a contingency run. But once these guys start thinking... Well, he, and Democrats ought to think a little about the above.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:03.084+0000"}
{"entityId": 1863, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Donald is getting the backing of the white-supremacist crowd, and the GOP from Priebus on down says nothing. Draw your own conclusion.\n\nLet me offer some friendly advice to the Republican Party that I learned firsthand as a Muslim American: You don\u2019t want to be defined by your most extreme members. And here\u2019s a little more advice. The longer the GOP leadership remains silent as Donald Trump garners increasing support from white supremacist organizations, the more likely the GOP will become known as the party of racists.\n\nI know, some of my progressive friends will say that\u2019s already the case. But that\u2019s not fair. Sure, there are racists drawn to the GOP, just like we have seen psychopaths attracted to Islam. I\u2019m sure not all Republicans are racists and I bet some are even disgusted by bigotry.\n\nWe are, however, seeing a bone-chilling attraction to Trump by white nationalist groups. It\u2019s almost like they view Trump\u2019s candidacy as their last stand against the changing demographics of America. He\u2019s become the poster child for their philosophy that \u201cWhite Lives Matter More.\u201d\n\nFor example, just last week David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux, publicly praised Trump as the best Republican candidate in the 2016 field because he \u201cunderstands the real sentiment of America.\u201d Duke applauded Trump\u2019s views on immigration that call for mass deportation of families, saying that Trump is \u201dspeaking out on this greatest immediate threat to the American people.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s tepid response to Duke\u2019s glowing praise was troubling to say the least: \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t want his endorsement. I don\u2019t need anyone\u2019s endorsement.\u201d When pressed by a reporter to repudiate Duke, Trump responded, \u201cSure, I would if that would make you feel better.\u201d\n\nSince Trump is not willing to make it clear he wants nothing to do with these hate groups or their followers, it\u2019s time for the GOP leadership to step up and do just that.\n\nAs the Southern Poverty Law Center\u2019s Mark Potok explained Saturday on my SiriusXM radio show, this response by Trump was \u201cincredibly weak,\u201d noting that Trump \u201cbarely repudiated\u201d Duke. Potok explained that as opposed to Trump saying I\u2019ll condemn Duke if it will \u201cmake you feel better,\u201d he should\u2019ve made it unequivocally clear he finds Duke\u2019s views despicable and doesn\u2019t want Duke or his white supremacist followers\u2019 support in any way.\n\nIn fact, in 2000, when Trump was considering running for president with a new political organization called the Reform Party, the billionaire publicly stated he wanted nothing to do with the party after he learned that Duke was a part of it. But now, with Trump actually running for president, he\u2019s far less vocal in denouncing Duke.\n\nDuke, however, is far from the only person tied to white supremacist or hate groups publicly endorsing Trump. Last week, white nationalist radio host James Edwards, a man who has warned against interracial marriage, called slavery \u201cthe greatest thing that ever happened to\u201d blacks, and featured a \u201croster of white supremacists\u201d on his show, publicly endorsed Trump.\n\nTrump has also been touted by neo-Nazi websites such as The Daily Stormer with articles like, \u201cWe are all Donald Trump Now.\u201d And as Media Matters set forth in detail a few days ago, the list of white nationalist leaders supporting Trump is alarmingly long.\n\nThe issue is not just that these hate groups see something they like in Trump. These groups have the right to endorse anyone they like. The more alarming issue is Trump\u2019s failure to publicly to condemn them.\n\nSince Trump is not willing to make it clear he wants nothing to do with these hate groups or their followers, it\u2019s time for the GOP leadership to step up and do just that. Trump is currently far and away the leader in the race for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination. Consequently, his actions will increasingly define the Republican Party. And the longer the GOP leaders remain silent, the more likely the Republican Party will be defined by the white supremacist groups publicly endorsing Trump.\n\nLuckily, the GOP is in a far better position than Muslim Americans to denounce its extremists. In our case, we are a small minority group with very limited media contacts. Getting the message out that we despise terrorists like ISIS and al Qaeda has been challenging to say the least despite our best efforts to do just that.\n\nIn contrast, the GOP has extensive media connections. In fact, the No. 1 cable news network, Fox News, showcases the party\u2019s leaders on a daily basis. It won\u2019t take much for the Republican leaders to get the media to cover their condemnation of the white nationalist and neo-Nazis supporting Trump.\n\nFor example, look what happened last year when we learned that the third-highest ranking member of the House Republican leadership, Steve Scalise, had given a speech to a white supremacist group in 2002 when running for office. House Speaker John Boehner simply issued a press release noting that he stood with Scalise because Scalise had acknowledged his actions were \u201cwrong and inappropriate.\u201d That press release was covered by media outlets nationwide.\n\nNow just imagine the media coverage if RNC chair Reince Priebus held a press conference, along with some of the GOP leadership in the House and Senate, to denounce the white nationalist groups supporting Trump. It would make headlines nationwide and send a clear message to all.\n\nIsn\u2019t it time for the GOP leaders to make it clear where they stand on white supremacists supporting their party\u2019s front-runner for the presidential nomination? I, for one, very much look forward to hearing what they have to say on this issue.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:03.750+0000"}

One noted that the senator\u2019s team has accepted contributions that appear to go above the legal limit.\n\nNone of the problems the commission identified are uniquely scandalous or game-changing, but it\u2019s atypical for a presidential candidate\u2019s team to get three notices from them in one day.\n\n\u201cTheir political machine has got some sand in the gears,\u201d said one campaign lawyer, who spoke anonymously. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a ways to go to establish a good compliance system.\u201d\n\nThe FEC\u2019s letter to Cruz\u2019s campaign suggests that his team doesn\u2019t have effective compliance mechanisms in place, the lawyer added.\n\nAnd Lawrence Noble, senior counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, pointed out that this isn\u2019t the first time Cruz has gotten rebuked for taking contributions that are too big. Cruz\u2019s senate campaign got letters about the same issue in 2011 , in 2012 , and in 2013 .\n\n\u201cThe fact that it keeps happening seems to represent some sort of systemic problem,\u201d Noble said.\n\n\u201cThey have a problem that they\u2019re not vetting these contributions well enough,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good sign, but it happens to other campaigns also.\u201d\n\nThe Cruz camp doesn\u2019t sound stressed about the situation.\n\n\u201cThese letters are completely routine,\u201d spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said in an email, referring to the three communications they got from the FEC on June 3.\n\n\u201cTheir political machine has got some sand in the gears,\u201d said one campaign lawyer.\n\nOne of those notices, sent to the treasurer of his Cruz for President committee, contained a six-page list of problematic contributions. These contributions came from donors who gave more than the legal limit of $2,700 per candidate per election.\n\nAn individual donor can give a candidate up to $5,400 per election cycle if he or she denotes half of that money for the primary campaign and half for the general (candidates who don\u2019t win their primaries then must return the donations they got for the general election).\n\nThus, couples can give up to $10,800 if they note that the donation comes from two adults\u2014for instance, $5,400 from a wife for the primary and general, and another $5,400 from her husband for the primary and general as well.\n\nThe compliance issue that the FEC noted for Cruz was that many of his donors cut $10,800 and $5,400 checks without noting how their donations were to be allocated.\n\nThat in and of itself isn\u2019t unusual, as most campaign donors aren\u2019t campaign finance law experts.\n\nSo campaigns typically set up mechanisms to keep donors from improperly contributing.\n\nThe next issue that the commission raised to Cruz\u2019s team involved his Ted Cruz Victory Committee. In another letter, the FEC said that the aggregate year-to-date totals it disclosed \u201cappear to be incorrect.\u201d It\u2019s a common error, per the attorney who spoke with The Daily Beast, and easy to fix.\n\nCruz\u2019s third issue is related to the quarterly report for his Senate campaign committee.\n\n\u201cWhile it is permissible for a person to make a contribution for the general election prior to the primary election, the recipient committee must employ an acceptable accounting method to distinguish between primary and general election contributions,\u201d wrote FEC senior campaign finance and reviewing analyst Bradley Matheson.\n\nThe attorney who spoke with the Beast said this could be because the FEC thinks Cruz won\u2019t run for re-election in the Senate.\n\n\u201cThe FEC RAD analyst who sent the letter must be under the mistaken impression that Senator Cruz, by declaring himself a candidate for president, is no longer a candidate for re-election to the Senate,\u201d the attorney said in an email. \u201cI\u2019m sure Cruz's counsel will set him straight!\u201d\n\nSo, again, none of these concerns are hair-raising or unprecedented. But, together, they may indicate that his team has a ways to go when it comes to efficiently following federal campaign rules.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:03.907+0000"}

Both needed to pass for the president\u2019s trade agenda to advance.\n\nThe president made phone calls, and senior White House officials lobbied furiously to get Democrats to support the package. Obama even added an additional personal touch on Friday morning, appearing on Capitol Hill in dramatic fashion to urge his fellow Democrats to support the trade package before them.\n\nIt proved to be too little too late: President Obama hasn\u2019t had a great relationship with Congress. Even those in his own party have been open critical of his lack of Congressional outreach and his administration\u2019s reluctance to bring them in the loop on issues of importance until the very last minute.\n\nAs he walked around in the Capitol, he was flanked by House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, who has been a loyal teammate in the past.\n\nNot this time.\n\nShortly after bidding the president adieu, she rebuked the president\u2019s initiatives. \u201cI will be voting to slow down fast-track,\u201d Pelosi said before she proceeded to do just that.\n\n\u201cI will be voting to slow down fast-track,\u201d Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said.\n\nApproval of the Trade Promotion Authority, also known as \u2018fast-track\u2019 is critical for the president, to allow him to conclude free trade deals with countries in the Asia-Pacific, a cornerstone of his foreign policy ambitions in the region.\n\nMany Democrats favor the Trade Adjustment Assistance bill, but saw its failure as the only way to prevent the president\u2019s free trade plans.\n\nWith just 126 voting in favor and 302 members of Congress voting against the TAA, Democrats expressed forceful disagreement with the president\u2019s plan to advance free trade agreements.\n\nThe left hailed the result as a victory for their grassroots activists, who have opposed the trade authority on the basis that it would kill jobs in the United States and be a net negative for the environment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re under no illusion that this is the end of the fight,\u201d said Jim Dean, chair of the progressive Democracy for America. \u201cThe fight against this job-killing trade deal will not rest until the TPP and Fast Track are dead, buried, and covered in six-inches of concrete.\u201d\n\nFriends of the Earth, another progressive group, said that Friday\u2019s vote was a \u201csignificant victory\u201d for those who oppose \u201ctoxic trade agreements.\u201d\n\nStill, it\u2019s not quite over yet.\n\nThe House of Representatives could revisit the issue again next weekend, allowing the White House additional time to make an additional round of lobbying to press the trade package\u2019s passage.\n\nThe bright side for Obama?

In fact, he just might be our best hope to avoid war with Iran.\n\nEnergy secretary Ernest Moniz has trouble passing for a bureaucrat. With longish wavy gray hair and a cherubic smile, he looks like he could be cast as the genius scientist in a sci-fi movie.\n\nBut don\u2019t be fooled. This Stanford-trained MIT nuclear physicist knows the ways of Washington. He is President Obama\u2019s secret weapon to convince Congress and the American public that should the administration reach a deal with Iran to curb its nuclear ambition, it is a deal worthy of their support.\n\nWhen a reporter noted at a breakfast meeting in Washington organized by the Christian Science Monitor last Monday that his relationship with Congress is pretty good and asked how he does it, Moniz made it sound easy.\n\n\u201cMaintaining open communications channels and using them early and often helps,\u201d he said. He happily testifies before the relevant House and Senate committees on energy and national security, and his briefings for members on the Iran deal have been widely attended, particularly in the senate. \u201cI didn\u2019t do a count, but north of 90 members\u201d were there, he said.\n\n\u201cWe plan to be completely open,\u201d he said. \u201cNo secrets here,\u201d he insisted, pointing to the issues about the phasing of sanctions relief that surfaced once negotiations resumed again after the initial euphoria of the framework agreement. One by one, in scientific and also layman\u2019s language, he addressed the concerns most often raised by critics. First on inspection, there will be access anywhere where there are grounds for suspicion, he said, including military bases. A process in place will \u201cnot be blockable by any one or two countries.\u201d\n\nSecond, he said there would be no enrichment and no enrichment R & D at Fordow, a key Iranian nuclear site. \u201cAssuming an agreement is completed, Fordow is shut down,\u201d Moniz said. Third, he said the breakout time of one year should Iran decide to build a nuclear bomb is \u201ccompletely based on our calculations, not their calculations, and we do not share with them the calculations\u201d except in the most general way. \u201cOur numbers are conservative,\u201d he said, and they\u2019re not based on the traditional time to a weapon, but on the time to access the material for a weapon, which adds another buffer.\n\nMoniz is well schooled in the schmoozing and the constant follow-up demanded in politics and in any bureaucracy.\n\nMoniz knows his stuff, but he also has a personal touch. When he learned his counterpart in the negotiations with Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi, had become a grandfather, he brought baby gifts, all with the MIT logo. Salehi had been at MIT in the mid-seventies, before the Iranian revolution, and while Moniz didn\u2019t know him at the time, he made the most of the connection. Last weekend, Moniz was at the White House Correspondents dinner \u201cwith all the models,\u201d he laughed. At Vanity Fair\u2019s after party he enthused to the Washington Post about the fun of networking.\n\nIn an otherwise tightly controlled and charisma-challenged Cabinet, Moniz has been given a longer leash, or maybe he\u2019s just taken it. Last fall, he appeared on NPR\u2019s Wait, Wait\u2026Don\u2019t Tell me, a gig that only a few of the most favored top administration officials have done.\n\nMoniz is well schooled in the schmoozing and the constant follow-up demanded in politics and in any bureaucracy. During the Clinton administration, he was the special negotiator for Russian nuclear materials after having led a comprehensive review of nuclear weapons stockpile stewardship at the Department of Energy, where he was an under secretary. Before that, he was in the Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Executive Office of the President, where he undoubtedly first started to master the moves that would make him successful in government.\n\nAsked about Moniz\u2019 role in the negotiations with Iran, a senior administration official told the Daily Beast that it was important to the President that any framework be able to stand on \u201crock-solid scientific footing.\u201d That is why his participation was critical to achieving the deal, and also why there\u2019s been no real doubt raised about the scientific underpinnings of what was announced, the official said. \u201cWe are never going to win over those playing politics\u2014but to all those seeking to make sound judgments, the science is beyond compelling.\u201d The official noted a long list of distinguished scientists, arms experts and Middle East experts backing the deal.\n\nThe science may be strong, but the opposition is emotional and political and not necessarily fact-based. It\u2019s like the debate over climate change, another issue where Moniz is well equipped to summon both expertise and passion for the challenges ahead. \u201cI\u2019ve been quoted before and I\u2019ll say it again,\u201d he told reporters. On climate change, \u201cIt\u2019s time to start believing and stop debating.\u201d The scientific case is overwhelming, he said, and while many remain Americans unconvinced, he is heartened that the private sector is responding, with global companies and CEOs taking action to mitigate the increasingly obvious effects of a warming planet.\n\nMoniz testified Tuesday before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to promote the first ever Quadrennial Energy Review, a comprehensive plan to combat climate change and modernize energy sources. It\u2019s basically bipartisan infrastructure legislation, he said, and it calls for $50 million over a decade. Congress has funded major infrastructure initiatives before, he says, as he sounds the alarm for an economy-wide response to climate change this decade.\n\nMoniz seems to relish tackling big problems. When a reporter asked about Nevada\u2019s Yucca Mountain, designated by Congress in 1987 as a nuclear waste site, he said candidly, \u201cIt\u2019s not workable. If you don\u2019t have consent from every branch of government, things never seem to get over the finish line.\u201d Nevada Democrat Harry Reid, among others, has stood in the way. Moniz has other ideas about where to store all our nuclear waste, \u201cseveral threads in play,\u201d he said.\n\nAn interviewer once asked Moniz, now 70, what one word he liked best to describe him. He said \u201cproblem-solver.\u201d Thankfully, he\u2019s taken that talent to Washington, a place with no shortage of seemingly intractable problems.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:04.755+0000"}

But his pleas did no go unheard, and despite the governor\u2019s best efforts, Odell is now a father.\n\nHis story is one of many that play out in the email exchanges between Bush and his staff\u2014which the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting recently made searchable\u2014and it gives an intriguing view into how the then-Florida governor struggled to explain his opposition to adoption rights for LGBT people.\n\nIt also shows that Bush and his top advisors were acutely aware of internal inconsistencies in the state\u2019s policy on same-sex adoption and foster families.\n\nIn 1977, Florida became the only state in the country to proactively ban gays and lesbians from adopting. Thanks in part to the dogged anti-gay activism of former Miss Oklahoma Anita Bryant, the state implemented legislation saying sexual orientation alone could disqualify prospective parents from adopting.\n\nThat law faced a court challenge during Bush\u2019s time as governor. In 2004, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against four gay men trying to overturn the law\u2014a decision Bush applauded.\n\n\u201c[I]t is in the best interest of adoptive children, many of whom come from troubled and unstable backgrounds, to be placed in a home anchored both by a father and a mother,\u201d Bush said at the time, according to the St. Petersburg Times. \u201cOur adoption policies take that important role into account.\u201d\n\nIn 2005, the Supreme Court refused to hear the men\u2019s appeal. But years later, the adoption ban was finally overturned.\n\nBush\u2019s email exchanges with gay constituents during the adoption fight indicate that his rhetoric on the topic was carefully crafted. And perhaps the most telling exchange is between Bush, his staffers, and Jessie Odell.\n\nOdell, a gay man then living in Florida with his long-term partner, emailed the governor on Feb. 9 of 2000 pushing him to change his stance on adoption.\n\n\u201cMy partner and I have been together for 11 years, our income is in the six figures, we have a very normal and stable home life,\u201d Odell wrote. \u201cWe have a lot to offer a child, love, the finest schools, and good moral standing. I also want to know, do you all feel that we would raise our children to be gay or lesbian? Do you all think that we would molest children?\u201d\n\nHe then appealed to the governor\u2019s traditional values.\n\n\u201cI understand that the media sometimes will show only the bad side of people, such as the drag parades on gay day, and other negative things of that nature,\u201d he continued. \u201cPlease understand that there is a whole other gay community, that the general public is unfamiliar with. My partner and I are in that community. We go to work, and pay bills just like you and your family.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am absolutely appalled to read those \u2018possible\u2019 responses they were considering sending,\u201d Odell told me.\n\nI spoke with Odell about this email, and he said he never heard back from the governor or his staff about it. But emails show that Bush wanted to respond and was ultimately persuaded against it by his aides. A day after getting the email, in fact, he forwarded it to staffers and asked them to draft a reply. Two months later, Brian Yablonski, one of Bush\u2019s most senior advisers, emailed around a proposed response.\n\n\u201cWhile I respect the great diversity of our state, and have not been a vocal opponent of the gay and lesbian lifestyle, I am not in favor of lifting the ban on gay and lesbian adoptions,\u201d wrote Yablonski in his suggested response for Bush.\n\nHe continued to say that placing a child in \u201can alternative environment, as loving it may be [sic],\u201d would be \u201can additional challenge for that child to face.\u201d\n\nThen Yablonski suggested that the governor touch on the gay \u201clifestyle.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not believe it is for the state to encourage or endorse this particular lifestyle,\u201d he wrote. \u201cSo long as it is within the bounds of the law, people may be free to do what they wish in their own private and personal affairs. However, when those activities require state approval and oversight, then that constitutes an explicit endorsement of the activity by the state. I am joined by the majority of policymakers and Floridians who do not believe it is appropriate for the state to sanction this particular lifestyle.\u201d\n\nYablonski suggested they conclude the email by saying, \u201cI am sure this is not the response that you wanted to hear, but on this matter we have difference of opinion.\u201d\n\nSally Bradshaw, perhaps Bush\u2019s most trusted aide, then weighed in on Yablonski\u2019s proposed response.\n\n\u201cI am concerned about the obvious inconsistency in the fact that we allow gay couples to become foster parents, but not to adopt children,\u201d she wrote. \u201cDon't we?\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s reply was confused.\n\n\u201cI didn't think we allowed gay couples to be foster parents,\u201d he wrote. \u201cOr maybe it is adoption.\u201d\n\nBradshaw then emailed, \u201cDon\u2019t you remember the info about [Kathleen Kearney, then-secretary of the Florida Department of Children and Families] presenting an award to a gay couple for being stellar foster parents? That\u2019s why this is problematic.\u201d\n\nYablonski then cleared up that the state had a \u201cdon\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell\u201d policy on gay foster parenting, and that as a result children were placed with gay foster parents.\n\nAnd his proposed response never went out. Yablonski told the email chain that he spoken to Kearney about the issue, and that she discouraged them from replying.\n\n\u201cShe encouraged us not to respond because there is on going litigation against the state on this matter,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd that was that. In 2011, the now-married Odell finally adopted a son who, despite Bush\u2019s concerns, has been on Honor Roll several times this year and is \u201cthe center of our universe.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod really played his hand in this, because we ended up with the most perfect, most gorgeous blond-haired, blue-eyed boy you\u2019ve ever seen and not a problem in the world, just happy to be loved and have daddies,\u201d he said.\n\nOdell never heard back from Bush.

It makes me EQUAL, just like everyone else.\u201d\n\nThen he raised a concern.\n\n\u201cI believe that making the statement that only a man and a woman must parent a child is to say the least, ignorant,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cWhat you said about gay parenting just hurts, even more because I have supported you for so long,\u201d he continued. \u201cI believe I could make a good parent one day and I hope that I will be able to marry the one I love before I die. I guess my only thought for you would be to take a look at people like me that support you even though they are ridiculed by their community for doing so, yet we still fight on.\u201d\n\nMartorell didn\u2019t get the response he wanted, but at least he got one. The governor wrote that he opposed anti-gay discrimination and hate, but didn\u2019t think barring gays from adopting was a type of discrimination.\n\n\u201cPerhaps our disagreement is that I believe that the creation of life by a husband and wife and the creation of a family from that should be something that is protected and treated differently than other family strutures [sic],\u201d he wrote. \u201cI don't believe that this is a discriminatory position.\u201d\n\nAnd a few days before the 2002 re-election, another gay supporter emailed Bush to express support and call for him to change his stance on adoption.\n\n\u201cIt seems that practically all people in the gay community think that if you are gay that you must vote for the democratic candidate,\u201d wrote Bob Fritz. \u201cNot so. Perhaps you should rethink your position on gay adoption and perhaps there may be another issue or two that I would like to see you take a different position on, but no candidate is perfect.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s stance on gay adoption gets less popular by the day. Talking Points Memo reported this week that, per UCLA demographer Gary Gates, gay adoption has even stronger public support than gay marriage.\n\nIt\u2019s perhaps unsurprising, then, that Bush has softened his rhetoric on the issue. This week, the former governor alluded to the gay adoption issue in an interview with the Christian Broadcast Network.\n\n\u201cIf we want to create a right to rise society where people\u2014particularly children born in poverty\u2014if we want to have them have a chance, which should be a core American value, we have to restore committed loving family life with a mom and a dad loving their children with their heart and soul,\u201d he said.\n\nBush hasn\u2019t endorsed Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s push for a constitutional amendment to keep the federal government from overturning states\u2019 marriage laws, and in 2012 told Charlie Rose that loving same-sex parents can be good role models. And earlier this year, he talked about his opposition to LGBT adoption in the past tense.\n\n\u201cPreviously, I opposed gay adoption, but it has since become the law in our state, and I respect that decision,\u201d he told Politifact in January.\n\nFor families like the Odells, that\u2019s good news. Still, as the emails from his time as governor show, Bush\u2019s messaging is certain to be handled carefully on LGBT issues as he struggles to court both social conservative die-hards, and a broader electorate that\u2019s much more pro-equality than when he last ran for office.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:04.921+0000"}

Here are some questions for Thursday\u2019s GOP debate.\n\nTO: Megyn Kelly, Bret Bauer, and Chris Wallace\n\n\n\nRE: Thursday's Republican Debate\n\n\n\nHey guys, I know you\u2019re frantically preparing for Thursday night\u2019s debate extravaganza, but I wanted to remind you that August 6 is also the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act becoming law. It provides a good hook to press the candidates to explain their views on voter IDs and other efforts which Democrats and also nonpartisan institutes claim suppress the votes of African Americans, the elderly, and students.\n\nYou could start the questioning with Scott Walker, since Wisconsin\u2019s voter photo ID law was one of the first pieces of legislation that Governor Walker signed into law in 2011, and it became a model many other states followed. It required that potential voters show a current or expired driver\u2019s license, or some form of military identification, or a U.S. passport, or a signed and dated student ID from an accredited state college or university, or a recent certificate of nationalization. If voters had none of these documents, they could present a birth certificate to receive a special photo ID issued by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. Such requirements made voting extremely arduous for the very people who disproportionately supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, such as racial minorities, students, and the elderly.\n\nFor example, there was the case of Gladys Butterfield, who had voted in every local, state, and presidential election since 1932. She had stopped driving decades ago, so she had no license. Her birth certificate was also missing. Her baptismal record was not acceptable as proof of identity in Wisconsin. Therefore, under the new law, she had to obtain a special government ID available only at a Department of Transportation (DOT) office before she could vote in the next presidential election. She was wheelchair bound so was dependent on a family member to drive her. (She could not apply online because she lacked a current license.) A quarter of the offices were open only one day a month and closed on weekends. Sauk City\u2019s office was perhaps the hardest to visit: in 2012 it was only open four days that entire year. Many other states\u2019 DOT offices posed similar problems: odd schedules, distance from public transportation, and the like.\n\nWith her daughter Gail\u2019s help, Butterfield applied for a state-certified birth certificate, costing $20, which she could show as proof of American citizenship. Next she had to visit the DOT. Transporting a wheelchair was difficult as was the inevitable wait in line to fill out the forms and have her picture taken. She was charged $28 because she did not know that it would not have cost her a cent if she had explicitly requested a free voter ID. DOT officials were instructed not to offer applicants a free ID unless applicants requested one. (When an outraged government employee emailed friends of the news and encouraged them to \u201cTELL ANYONE YOU KNOW!! EVEN IF THEY DON\u2019T NEED THE FREE ID, THEY MAY KNOW SOMEONE THAT DOES!!,\u201d he was abruptly fired.)\n\nLike the elderly, students who wanted to vote in the next election would find new obstacles when they again tried to vote in Wisconsin and many other states.\n\n\u201cMy mother is fortunate that she has someone to take her through this vote suppression procedure,\u201d Gail Butterfield Bloom told a journalist in 2011. \u201cHow many elderly or disabled residents do not? Are Scott Walker and his followers making it difficult for the elderly, disabled, poor and young to vote? My mother thinks so.\u201d\n\nSo too, perhaps, did the 178,000 other Wisconsin seniors who did not have a driver\u2019s license or a state photo ID. They would have to go through similar efforts to exercise their constitutional rights. Sadly, Gladys Butterfield passed away before she could vote in 2012. Does Governor Walker still support voter IDs despite the fact that even George W. Bush\u2019s Justice Department found almost no evidence of illegal voting which would have been prevented by voter IDs?\n\nLike the elderly, students who wanted to vote in the next election would find new obstacles when they again tried to vote in Wisconsin and many other states. Under Wisconsin\u2019s new law, student IDs would be accepted as proof of identity only if they contained a signature and an expiration date. But in 2011 the cards carried by Wisconsin\u2019s 182,000 students were not signed or dated and, therefore, would not be accepted at the polls.\n\nLast year, the legislature also cut back on early voting hours during the workweek and stopped them completely on weekends, thereby destroying opportunities to vote used predominately by African Americans.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a question for Senator Ted Cruz: Your state quickly enacted new laws soon after the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 decision, Shelby County v. Holder, which gutted the Voting Rights Act. The state\u2019s strict voter ID law is now in the hands of a judge who will decide its fate. Does Senator Cruz side with the plaintiffs who want to expand the voting pool or the state\u2019s attorney who wishes to limit it?\n\nAnd finally you could quiz Governor Jeb Bush about the electoral mismanagement that put his brother in the White House in 2000. Reporter Ari Berman believes that the mix-up which led to the disenfranchisement of many qualified voters cost Al Gore the presidency.\n\nHave fun!\n\nGary May is not employed by Fox News.

Just in time for another potential showdown between the Bush and Clinton families, Kate Andersen Brower is out with a juicy new book in which some of these usually silent workers dish, The Residence: Inside the Private World of The White House.\n\nThe book is not all salacious tidbits\u2014though they do make for a fun read. It is also a touching story of the often nameless men and women who toil to make sure that the most stressed out family on Earth can live their lives just a little bit easier.\n\nHere are some of the juiciest bits.\n\nThe Clintons were the most polarizing, the first Bush the most beloved.\n\nIn chapter after chapter, the consensus seems to be that George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush were the most beloved and respected of the presidencies covered in the book\u2014which may have had to do with the fact that they were somewhat used to staff. On the other hand, the book is filled with quote after quote about how difficult the Clintons were and how paranoid they were. Friends of Bill\u2019s consistently set off alarm bells for the Secret Service for having criminal records. On the other hand, many of the women interviewed in the book felt that Hillary \u201cwas very, very sympathetic to working women\u201d and had a good relationship with the female staff.\n\nHillary hit Bill with a book.\n\nThe Monica Lewinsky era in the book is perhaps the juiciest. One anecdote that has made the rounds is that Hillary hit Bill so hard with a book that there was blood all over the bed and the president needed stitches. That time period also took its toll on White House workers, who would often find themselves berated for little things by Hillary. The staff was also consistently shocked by the couple throughout their time in the office, from \u201ctheir vicious cursing\u201d and \u201cperiods of stony silence.\u201d\n\nOne anecdote that has made the rounds is that Hillary hit Bill so hard with a book that there was blood all over the bed and the president needed stitches.\n\nHer go-to comfort food was mocha cake.\n\nDuring the feeding frenzy after the affair became public, Hillary reportedly found solace in a truly humanizing source\u2014mocha cake. Former Pastry Chef Roland Mesnier said he \u201cmade many, many mocha cakes\u201d during this period, and that Hillary would often call up \u201cin a small, unassuming voice\u201d and ask for a mocha cake that night.\n\nThe staff thought Hillary knew about Monica.\n\nIn the eyes of some of the staff, Monica Lewinsky was not part of some vast right-wing conspiracy, and Clinton \u201cknew about Lewinsky long before it came out.\u201d\n\nChelsea Clinton called the Secret Service \u201cpigs.\u201d\n\nFormer White House florist Ron Payne told the author that he overheard an exchange between Chelsea and a Secret Service agent. Chelsea was on the phone with friends from Sidwell Friends school when she said, \u201cOh, I\u2019ve got to go. The pigs are here.\u201d When the agent retorted that his job was \u201cto stand between you, your family, and a bullet,\u201d Chelsea reportedly replied, \u201cWell, that\u2019s what my mother and father call you.\u201d\n\nA rapist tried to work at the White House.\n\nApparently there is a consistent problem of people with criminal records applying to work at the White House. In one case, during the Clinton administration, an applicant told interviewers at the last minute he had been convicted of rape.\n\nPresident Obama rocked out to Mary J. Blige after moving in.\n\nOne member of the White House staff overheard President Obama and the first lady late at night after the 2009 inaugural balls. \u201cI got this, I got this. I got the inside now,\u201d he overheard. And then, with Michelle Obama in a T-shirt and sweatpants, the couple turned on Mary J. Blige\u2019s \u201cReal Love\u201d and danced together.\n\nDesiree Rogers was a nightmare.\n\nDesiree Rogers, the former White House social secretary who stepped down after the Salahi party-crashing scandal, was seen by longtime White House butlers, housekeeping, florists, and other staff as \u201cdisrespectful of the mansion\u2019s long-standing traditions\u201d and that most of the staff \u201cwere happy to see her go.\u201d She kept demanding that the White House have \u201cthe Four Seasons look.\u201d Said former Chief Usher Admiral Stephen Rochon of working with her, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t exacting, it was just impossible.\u201d\n\nGeorge W. Bush was exactly how you would imagine him.\n\nIn what will come as a surprise for few, Brower writes that President George W.

Harper. $19.99 (via Amazon)\n\nRonald Reagan had a penchant for sharing national-security secrets with the staff.\n\nAmong the many concerns on Nancy Reagan\u2019s plate apparently was that \u201cshe was always wary of having him talk too much to the staff, especially when it came to divulging national-security secrets.\u201d This observation came after an anecdote in which Reagan tips off the White House chef that he just gave orders to bomb Libya.\n\nJimmy Carter\u2019s sons had bongs in their rooms.\n\nOne White House residence worker told Bower, \u201cI would regularly have to move bongs\u201d when the person went to freshen up the boys\u2019 rooms on the third floor.\n\nLBJ had a shower that shot water at his crotch and up his rear.\n\nOne of the more bizarre sections was LBJ\u2019s presidency-long obsession with getting a shower that could truly blast and scald him.

Exactly. If you\u2019ve never heard of Representative Jeff Duncan, you\u2019re not alone. The former banker and auctioneer isn\u2019t well known outside his conservative South Carolina district. But Republicans running for president know Duncan as a man who is quietly emerging as an unlikely yet crucial figure in the process to pick the Republican nominee for 2016.\n\nIn South Carolina this past weekend, more than a dozen Republicans from across the country paraded across the stage of the \u201cFreedom Summit\u201d in downtown Greenville, assuring the Chick-Fil-A-fed crowd they are looking at the Next Conservative President of the United States. And a big part of why they\u2019re here is to impress this obscure third-term congressman.\n\nSouth Carolina hosts the first primary in the South, and is a key bellwether for grassroots conservative support. Since the birth of the modern primary system, only one Republican candidate\u2014Mitt Romney\u2014has lost the state and then gone on to win the nomination. And not only does Duncan\u2019s 3rd Congressional district include the I-85 corridor and the richest source of conservative votes in the state, Duncan himself has become a kind of folk hero to Tea Party activists. He was named the most conservative congressman in America by the influential Heritage Action, and is among the handful of GOP members to vote against John Boehner for Speaker not once, but twice.\n\nDuncan co-hosted the South Carolina Freedom Summit with Citizens United, which attracted 2,000 activists on Saturday, and hosts his own \u201cFaith and Freedom BBQ\u201d fundraiser every August, a sort of \u201cTom Harkin Iowa Steak Fry\u201d without all the steaks and liberals. Duncan\u2019s BBQ drew Senator Marco Rubio and 1,400 locals to his upstate district last year and is a already hot ticket for potential speakers going into next year\u2019s presidential primaries.\n\nHow did Duncan, the one-time walk-on for the Clemson University football team who readily admits he saw no playing time, become one of the biggest gets in the race to the White House for the 20-something Republicans who say they want the job?\n\nDuncan himself didn\u2019t offer much insight at first.\n\n\u201cTo be friends with Jeff Duncan, you\u2019re not going to get any further to the right than that. It\u2019s a great place for him to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see my name on all these banners is sort of humbling because it\u2019s not something I seek out,\u201d he said in an interview across the hall from the stage that was festooned with 20-foot \u201cRep. Jeff Duncan\u201d banners and signs. But in the same breath he referred to himself as an \u201cunabashed\u201d conservative, and that seems to be the point for the audience, a crucial block of potential GOP primary voters in the second-in-the-nation primary state, and the marquee candidates looking for his time and advice.\n\n\u201cWhether the candidates seek me out, I\u2019m not looking for that,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cIf they do, they do, and I don\u2019t mind telling them what it\u2019s going to take to win as a conservative in South Carolina.\u201d\n\nHe ticks off \u201cleadership,\u201d \u201cvision,\u201d \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d and \u201cinspiration\u201d on the list of qualities he and his fellow South Carolina conservatives will be looking for, but not electability.\n\n\u201cWe want a winner, of course. We want to make sure we can pick someone who can win over the Democrat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I hear the term \u2018electability\u2019 I kind of scrunch my nose up a little bit and go, really? They say, \u2018Ted Cruz can\u2019t win.\u2019 Really? Have you talked to Ted?\u201d\n\nDuncan has. He\u2019s talked to a number of the other hopefuls, too, including Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, and Mike Huckabee, who called Duncan at home last weekend to say his granddaughter\u2019s 3rd birthday would keep him away from the Freedom Summit, but he promised to be in South Carolina soon, which he was.\n\nHow about Jeb Bush? \u201cI haven\u2019t talked to Jeb,\u201d Duncan said. \u201cSo I\u2019m not going to talk about him.\u201d\n\nIf Bush plans to make a play in the state, Duncan would be a good place to start his courtesy calls. Along with Senator Tim Scott, the wildly popular senator based in Charleston who was once Duncan\u2019s roommate in Washington, activists and GOP operatives increasingly point to Duncan as the man to meet.\n\n\u201cJeff Duncan\u2019s got the golden stamp,\u201d said Dave Woodard, Duncan\u2019s former professor at Clemson who also eventually became his pollster. \u201cTo be friends with Jeff Duncan, you\u2019re not going to get any further to the right than that. It\u2019s a great place for him to be.\u201d\n\nFor a party whose base has marched to the right in the last eight years, only to see accused squishes emerge as their nominees for president, the next GOP candidate claiming to be \u201cseverely conservative\u201d is going to need a few good character witnesses. And Duncan is the perfect guy to vouch for you in a state where three out of five likely primary voters call themselves born-again Christians.\n\nDuncan\u2019s friends know he\u2019s not the sort of flashy extrovert who makes headlines in politics, but even his old foes say there\u2019s more to Duncan than meets the eye.\n\nAlan Ray, now a South Carolina adviser to Senator Ted Cruz, ran one of the six Republican campaigns for the open House seat that Duncan eventually won in 2010.\n\n\u201cIn terms of an endorsement a campaign would be looking for, obviously Rep.

The report described forced rectal feeding, nonstop interrogation, a detainee forced to stand on broken legs, a \u201cwell worn\u201d waterboard used by the CIA, the near-drowning of one detainee, and a notorious \u201cblack site\u201d for detainees in Afghanistan called the Salt Pit.\n\nMcCain, himself a victim of torture as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, tried to prohibit the use of torture in 2005, but his legislation covered only military interrogation.

You want the government and the practices of the United States to be based on laws, not the whim and will of men.\u201d\n\nThe McCain-Feinstein amendment on torture would require a regular review of the Army Field Manual to ensure legal compliance and to ensure that techniques in the manual are in line with \u201ccurrent, evidence-based, best practices for interrogation.\u201d In addition, the measure would compel the U.S. government notify and provide access to the Red Cross whenever the United States detains an individual in an armed conflict.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:06.433+0000"}
{"entityId": 1872, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A group is looking to get third-party and independent candidates into the debates with the two major presidential nominees. But is that really a good idea?\n\nThe numbers tell the story of voter disenchantment with the two major political parties. More than 40 percent of Americans identify as independents, and 65 percent wish they had the option to vote for an independent candidate for president in 2016. If Donald Trump makes good on his threat to run third party should he feel disrespected by the GOP, voters might get their wish and Trump would likely join the two major party nominees in the presidential debates.\n\nFor anybody but Trump, however, getting onto the debate stage with the Republican and Democratic nominees is such a high hurdle that potentially credible candidates are discouraged from even trying. Among independent candidates, only Ross Perot in 1992 managed to poll above the 15 percent threshold in the spring and summer to get him into the debates with President George H.W. Bush and then Governor Bill Clinton.\n\nFrustration with how the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD) allegedly favors the two major political parties and locks out promising alternatives prompted financier Peter Ackerman to found \u201cLevel the Playing Field\u201d. Together with the Green Party and the Libertarian National Committee, the group is suing the Federal Election Commission to \u201cChange the Rule\u201d that requires any contender outside the Big Two to meet that 15 percent polling threshold to qualify for the critically important fall debates.\n\nIn their court filing, the plaintiffs charge that the CPD, established in 1987, uses \u201cnonobjective, biased rules designed to exclude independent or third-party candidates from the presidential debates.\u201d They contend that the 15 percent polling requirement means that a candidate must have a minimum 60 percent national name recognition. According to pollster Doug Schoen, who is cited in the lawsuit, reaching that level requires $113 million worth of advertising, and no third party or independent candidate has ever raised that much.\n\nThe suit was filed in June, but two months are a lifetime in politics, and Trump\u2019s rise in the polls -- along with his braggadocio about how rich he is \u2014 create a radically different context for the facts as presented. What are meant to be eye-popping numbers, like Schoen\u2019s prediction that a third party in 2016 would be looking at an overall budget of $266 million, don\u2019t seem so outlandish when Trump is in the mix.\n\nIf Trump chooses to run third party, he would likely meet the criteria, as they currently exist, to get into the 2016 presidential debates. But what Level the Playing Field seeks to do is open the door to other less well known candidates who are outside the two-party system and want to run as an independent.\n\n\u201cIt sounds appealing in terms of democratic theory, but its practical consequences may not strengthen democracy but actually weaken it,\u201d says Mark Siegel, who has a Ph.D. in political science and is a former executive director of the Democratic National Committee. \u201cA lot of people depend on the debates to make their decision. The more time you give to unelected third, fourth and fifth parties, the less time voters get to hear from people who have a chance to win.\u201d\n\nLevel the Playing Field is the successor to Americans Elect, also founded by Ackerman, which got on the ballot in 41 states in 2012 but was unable to attract credible candidates in part, the lawsuit contends, because they knew they would be excluded from the debates.\n\nIn pressing to \u201cChange the Rule,\u201d the lawsuit contends that simply lowering the 15 percent threshold to 10 percent, for example, would not be enough. Level the Playing Field proposes a national signature drive competition where the winner would be expected to collect some 4 to 6 million signatures from a cross section of Americans to gain entrance to the debates.\n\nIt sounds like American Idol, and it was an early red flag to one of Level the Playing Field\u2019s backers, Les Francis, who was involved on the Democratic side in debate negotiations in 1980, 1984, and 1988.\n\n\u201cI worry about the lack of safeguards to prevent the emergence of a truly fringe or even dangerous third candidate\u201d\n\n\u201cI worry about the lack of safeguards to prevent the emergence of a truly fringe or even dangerous third candidate, someone with a small but highly energized and zealous following, and how that might cause the two major party nominees to forgo the debates altogether, or to seek a separate arrangement with another debate host/sponsor,\u201d he wrote in a letter to Ackerman early last month. But that alone wasn\u2019t what drove him to end his association with LPF, he explains in the letter.\n\nFrancis was one of fifty signatories to the LPF lawsuit along with a host of disillusioned Democrats and Republicans that include former Republican governors Jon Huntsman, Tom Kean and Christine Todd Whitman, former Democratic Senator Robert Kerrey, and former Independent Senator Joe Lieberman, among many others with perhaps not so obvious a partisan gripe.\n\nFrancis still agrees that the \u201cpartisan duopoly\u201d of the CPD should be broken up, but he parted company with Ackerman when Level the Playing Field doubled down on its anti-CPD message with a series of ads in the Wall Street Journal that make Commission co-chairs, Republican Frank Fahrenkopf and Democrat Mike McCurry, look like they are on \u201cWanted\u201d posters. \u201cTWO MEN AND THEIR FRIENDS crush any chance for an independent candidate for president to compete on a level playing field,\u201d the ads declare.\n\nCPD\u2019s board is a roster of some of the two parties\u2019 most distinguished alums, people like former Missouri Senator Jack Danforth, former head of the CIA Leon Panetta, and former member of Congress Jane Harman, who heads the Wilson Center. \u201cThese are serious public-minded people,\u201d says Francis. \u201cThese are not hacks.\u201d\n\nFrancis says serious talks were underway with the CPD to make some changes and possibly to lower the polling threshold to 10 percent when Ackerman\u2019s group blew everything up by joining forces with the Greens and the Libertarians in what Francis calls \u201ca bank shot\u201d to challenge the legitimacy of the Commission. He concludes his stinging letter to Ackerman, a copy of which he shared with the Daily Beast, with an insistence that the course Ackerman has chosen will likely lead to \u201cglorious, symbolic defeat over the possibility of some measurable and meaningful reforms.\u201d\n\nThe presidential debates are more than a year away, and reforms are in the works as the CPD grapples with a new media environment and the challenge of reaching large groups of voters turned off by overly scripted politicians and debate rules that protect the candidates from any meaningful exchanges.

{"entityId": 1875, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Julian Castro is attractive and charismatic. He also has no business being a heartbeat away from the presidency.\n\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way early: Hillary Clinton\u2019s rumored No. 1 choice for vice president would be the least-qualified nominee for the job in decades.\n\nSure, it\u2019s a little early to play Hillary \u201cveepstakes,\u201d but when you don\u2019t really have a primary to worry about, you get speculation like this: During a Spanish-language interview with Univision\u2019s Al Punto the other day, Henry Cisneros, Bill Clinton\u2019s former HUD secretary, predicted current HUD Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro would be Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate in 2016.\n\nCastro\u2019s \u201cthe first person on their list,\u201d Cisneros averred. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a second option,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause he is the superior candidate considering his record, personality, demeanor, and Latin heritage.\u201d This, of course, isn\u2019t a novel idea. Just months ago, my Daily Beast colleague Eleanor Clift speculated Castro is in \u201cVP Training Camp.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn many ways, picking Castro makes perfect sense. It would potentially excite Democrats who might be growing tired of the Clintons. It\u2019s not like Hillary has an obvious running mate (and it\u2019s hard to imagine that selecting, say, former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley would generate a ton of enthusiasm, or bring that much to the table). It would also balance the ticket in terms of age (Castro is just 40). And if it went well, it could also solve a long-term problem for the Democrats, which is that they don\u2019t have a bench of young rising stars with the experience to lead, and have fewer big-name statewide Hispanic candidates than Republicans do.\n\nThis was likely part of President Obama\u2019s calculus in offering Castro a chance to serve in his cabinet. It was unlikely that Castro could rise to the U.S. Senate or governor in deep-red Texas any time soon, and so there had to be a Plan B for giving him a resume that would be deemed minimally acceptable.\n\nThat Castro is Hispanic is no small detail. His addition to the ticket would a) make the 2016 Democratic ticket historic in two ways, and b) potentially blunt the possibility that Marco Rubio might be the GOP nominee, which would give Republicans the chance to also make history.\n\n\n\nSo picking Castro makes a great deal of political sense. Democrats are eager to nail down the rapidly-growing Hispanic voting constituency, and this\u2014coupled with Hillary\u2019s recent decision to go \u201call in\u201d on immigration reform\u2014could pose a serious threat to Republicans who might eventually find it mathematically impossible to win the White House. Yes, Castro (unlike Rubio or Jeb Bush) might not speak Spanish fluently. But, unlike any of the GOP\u2019s presidential hopefuls, he\u2019s Mexican-American, which matters for a variety of reasons, not least of which is that that\u2019s easily the largest Latino group in the U.S.\n\nNow, based on everything above, you might think this is a slam-dunk, right? Wrong. This is still a high-risk move.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s begin with the fact that Castro\u2019s most important elected experience was as San Antonio\u2019s mayor, which is a largely symbolic position. \u201cSan Antonio\u2019s city government is a council-manager system,\u201d explains the Atlantic\u2019s City Lab : \u201cUnlike the strong-mayor governments of Chicago or New York, San Antonio\u2019s government is led by a city manager, which is appointed by the City Council. The city charter invests in the city manager the authority to execute the laws and administer the government of the city.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Geraldine Ferraro, Senator Dan Quayle, and Governor Sarah Palin all got heat for their lack of experience, but at least they had all been elected to real jobs with actual responsibilities.\n\nElected in 2009, Castro was basically a glorified ribbon-cutter. He had \u201cno executive authority,\u201d as the Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York noted last year when Castro was tapped for the HUD job. As mayor, he made around $4,000 a year, while the city manager made $355,000 to actually run the city. To make ends meet, Castro gave paid speeches and wrote a memoir, which together got him roughly $200,000 in 2013. Before that, he made a small fortune as a lawyer in a career that attracted a fair amount of scrutiny.\n\nBy the time November 2016 rolls around, Castro will have run HUD\u2014one of our less-efficient federal bureaucracies\u2014for a couple years and change. The last guy to try to use that office as a launching pad, for what it\u2019s worth, was Andrew Cuomo, who ran for New York governor in 2002 after leaving the agency and got clobbered in the Democratic primary.\n\nSo the experience of the supposed front-runner for the Democratic nomination boils down to five years in a ceremonial position and a couple years at HUD. Is this a worthy qualification of someone to be a heartbeat away from the presidency? Seriously, isn\u2019t the city manager actually more qualified to be vice president? And lastly, isn\u2019t the selection of a potential vice president especially important when the top of the ticket is of a certain age? I seem to remember that being bandied about when McCain was running.\n\nWhat we have here is a transparent attempt to pick someone inexperienced for political\u2014not governing\u2014 reasons. What we have here is an obvious attempt to pick someone young and attractive and charismatic to cover up the fact that the top of the ticket is none of those things. What we have here is an attempt to play identity politics by picking someone in the hopes that their identity will woo potential voters.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen this before, and it hasn\u2019t worked out well. Representative Geraldine Ferraro, Senator Dan Quayle, and Governor Sarah Palin all got heat for their lack of experience, but at least they had all been elected to real jobs with actual responsibilities.\n\nJuli\u00e1n Castro has everything you need to be the perfect running mate\u2014except, of course, the experience and resume to actually lead the country should, God forbid, something happen to the president. If Hillary selects him as her running mate, it will be an indication that she\u2019s willing to be reckless with the country\u2019s future in order to win. Clinton-Castro is a real possibility, but it should be noted that this one is high-risk for the country, even if it\u2019s high-reward for the Democrats.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:07.500+0000"}

What he\u2019s not known as is a hidden geek who can\u2019t get enough of \u201cCandy Crush.\u201d He tells The Daily Beast why he can\u2019t have a console.\n\nLong before Ted Cruz became a senator from Texas, he was a gamer. He\u2019s known for being pugilistic on the Senate floor, but sometimes he\u2019d rather be fighting cartoon zombies on his iPhone.\n\nIt\u2019s an uncommon lens through which to view Cruz, a controversial conservative figure who is now running for the highest political office in the country. Cruz\u2019s video game habit fits into a largely hidden geek persona that lurks just behind his better-known public reputation as an obstinate Tea Party firebrand.\n\nAt the moment, Cruz is playing \u201cPlants vs. Zombies,\u201d a game where users collect sunlight points to feed plants who fight off waves of zombies; \u201cCandy Crush,\u201d the puzzle game where he claims he\u2019s in the 217th level; and \u201cThe Creeps!,\u201d a tower defense game.\n\nHis video game addiction is so severe, Cruz says, he has to proactively deny himself the ability to spend time on it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a console, mostly as a time management tool, because if I had one, I would use it far too much,\u201d he told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe Texas Republican explains the origins of his love for video games as a generational phenomenon. He ticks off his favorite games at his childhood arcade: \u201cGalaga,\u201d \u201cSpace Invaders,\u201d \u201cCentipede.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was a kid growing up in the \u201970s and \u201980s. I had a Nintendo, an Atari,\u201d he said. \u201cI still remember the Christmas we got our first \u2018Pong\u2019 game.\u201d\n\nHis love for video games evolved over time as he entered college, then law school. David Panton, who was Cruz\u2019s roommate for 4\u00bd years through Princeton and later Harvard Law, recalls all-nighters spent on \u201cSuper Mario Brothers\u201d and Japanese fighting games.\n\nPutting aside debate and school government, Panton said, \u201cour favorite activity\u2026was video games.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe would spend many hours playing video games, often until the sun came up. In reality, Ted was a much better player than I was\u2014he beat me in everything\u2014but I think I was sufficiently competitive that he felt somewhat challenged,\u201d Panton told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019m a far better video game player today as a result of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nVideo games have only once entered into Cruz\u2019s comments about government and public policy: in December, when he publicly mused about the overuse of drones in warfare.\n\n\u201cThere are also concerns from the perspective of national security. No administration has used drones as aggressively as has the Obama administration. And I\u2019m worried about what I would call video-game warfare,\u201d Cruz said at a Foreign Policy Initiative forum in Washington, D.C.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a console, mostly as a time management tool, because if I had one, I would use it far too much.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s where video games help: Cruz suffers from a perception of rigidity. When asked a question, his responses are always airtight and measured, the mark of a former debate champion. Often these conversations seem stilted and rehearsed. Unlike a more gregarious politician like Senator John McCain, Cruz doesn\u2019t make unscripted jokes or pal around much.\n\nIf asked a question Wednesday that he was previously asked on Monday, he will repeat his original answer nearly word for word, as if it were memorized, raising the risk of questions about how genuine he really is.\n\nHis passion for video games, and the way he uses them to connect with his children, cuts through some of that.\n\n\u201cI play with my daughters,\u201d he told The Daily Beast. \u201cOne of the fun things that I do with Caroline and Catherine is we get on the iPhone or the iPad and play games. Drives my wife crazy. She doesn\u2019t like it, but both girls like to curl up and play games. In our household, I\u2019m the one in charge of taking the girls to Chuck E. Cheese, and it\u2019s not much of a secret that I don\u2019t mind doing so. I\u2019m trying to get brownie points from [his wife] Heidi for taking them to Chuck E.

So Cruz\u2019s love for video games is an admission that presidential candidates have only really been able to make in the past few years.\n\nBut there is one time a video game was used against Cruz. In Texas\u2019s 2012 Senate Republican primary, David Dewhurst launched an attack ad accusing Cruz of being \u201cPAC-Man.\u201d Dewhurst used the classic video game and accompanying theme song to highlight the funds Cruz received from super PACs in Washington, D.C.

Hillary wanted to protect reporters from the attacks they might face from these everyday Americans, who might attempt to smear their lenses or muff their hair if anyone got too close to her. In fact, the reporters should be thanking Hillary for so thoughtfully protecting them. Did Jeb Bush every buy them a rope? No, I don\u2019t think so.\n\nThe media are out-of-touch: Reporters following campaigns are happy to be cordoned off on luxury campaign buses and special front-row-view seats at events. They revel in this elite, out-of-touch status. Meanwhile, Hillary just wants to talk to regular folks who never had a chance to go to the Ivy League schools most reporters attend. (Note: If someone points out that Hillary went to Yale Law School, quickly talk about how Ted Cruz went to two Ivy League schools and was born in Canada.)\n\nCreating jobs, one billion-dollar campaign at a time: The rope was made in America. The interns who were holding it were Americans. This is a testament to Hillary\u2019s commitment to the working men and women of America, and proves Hillary will be a job creator, one rope at a time.\n\nThere is no way that Walmart and Wall Street can get around an actual thick piece of rope.\n\nOn America\u2019s birthday, echoing America\u2019s great history: Ranching and roping are as American to our nation as apple pie, and the campaign was cleverly incorporating this fundamentally patriotic iconography into the portrait of the candidate. Like the valiant pioneers of the Wild West, Hillary is a free spirit.\n\nAs President, Hillary Clinton will rope off our enemies: In this bold moment, Americans get to see what kind of Commander-in-Chief Hillary Clinton will really be. She has the fortitude and vision to rope off ISIS and Iran because, unlike with some hypothetical red line, you can\u2019t cross an actual rope. (Note: If anyone brings up that we don\u2019t literally have enough rope to wrap around Iran, immediately change the subject by congratulating the women\u2019s World Cup team.)\n\nAnd she will rein in special interests: If Hillary can corral the press as candidate, wait until you see how she herds special interests as president! Never mind how cozy she\u2019s been with big business in the past. There is no way that Walmart and Wall Street can get around an actual thick piece of rope.\n\nRepublicans are anti-borders: Republicans only talk a big game about immigrants and the need for border security. But as we\u2019ve seen from their reactions here, Republicans are clearly uncomfortable with boundaries and borders. Hillary will put a giant rope around America\u2019s southern border and hold us all tight. A rope that will welcome all people except Donald Trump.\n\nCalm down, people, it was just a rope: Or two ropes, technically. But if the world is complaining about something Hillary did, it must be Monday. Or Tuesday. Or Wednesday\u2026. Come on! Could the media have climbed under or over the rope?

That flag includes four stars, three to symbolize the countries that held the Arkansas territory\u2014Spain, France and the United States\u2014and the fourth, as Hasselbeck said, \u201cto commemorate the Confederate states of America.\u201d\n\nNowhere in the state\u2019s legislative history does it explain why the 63-year-old flag needed to be made official, but Arkansas historians have two explanations. First, the legislature was moving to give the state a number of \u201cofficial\u201d designations\u2014think \u201cofficial state butterfly,\u201d \u201cofficial state grain\u201d\u2014as it celebrated its sesquicentennial.\n\nSecond, Bill Clinton and the state legislature were pushing through a series of measures to ban flag desecration as the U.S. Supreme Court debated and eventually struck down the 48 state laws against flag burning, including Arkansas\u2019s ban. Historians told me they believed the 1987 flag bill was passed to specify the official design of the state flag in conjunction with that effort. As governor, Clinton later signed a bill making it a crime to burn or deface a flag, a move that drew vocal complaints from the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nIt is true that Clinton did nothing in his time as governor to remove the state flag\u2019s reference to Arkansas\u2019s role in the Confederacy. But by all accounts, the bill he signed making the state\u2019s flag official was not created as a Confederate memorial. The sponsor of the bill, longtime Arkansas legislator W.D. \u201cBill\u201d Moore, has since died, but former Representative Steve Smith said, \u201cI served with Bill Moore in the early 1970s, and he was hardly a neo-Confederate. Nor was Bill Clinton.\u201d\n\nIn 2007, Hillary Clinton said she thought South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds entirely, not just from the front of the capitol.\n\nThe more recent Clintonian history related to the Confederate flag is easier to find and may be one of the more straightforward positions either Clinton has ever taken. Both have been consistently, unambiguously against its use.\n\nDuring Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, he endorsed Georgia Governor Zell Miller\u2019s fruitless attempt to remove the St. Andrews Cross from the Georgia state flag, a change that eventually came nine years later, and made Miller the keynote speaker at Clinton\u2019s 1992 Democratic National Committee nominating convention.\n\nIn 2000, as South Carolina wrestled with the future of the Confederate flag that still flew above its capitol, then-President Clinton gave the state his unsolicited advice during a visit to Allen University, a historically black college in Columbia, just miles from the state capitol: Take the flag down. \u201cAs long as the waving symbol of one American\u2019s pride is the shameful symbol of another American\u2019s pain, we have bridges to cross in this country and we better get across them,\u201d' he told the students.\n\nWhen Hillary Clinton became a candidate for president herself in 2007, she said much the same thing during her own visit to the state, telling the AP she thought South Carolina should remove the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds entirely, not just from the front of the capitol.\n\nAnd Tuesday, after South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley\u2019s call to finally remove the Confederate flag from the capitol grounds in the wake of the Charleston tragedy, Hillary Clinton called it the right thing to do.\n\n\u201cI appreciate the actions begun yesterday by the governor and other leaders of South Carolina to remove the Confederate battle flag from the State House, recognizing it as a symbol of our nation\u2019s racist past that has no place in our present or our future,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t fly there, it shouldn\u2019t fly anywhere.\u201d\n\nThere are more than enough reasons for members of the conservative media to be dubious about the Clintons: the deleted emails, the paid speeches, the Friends of Bill you thought went away with the Y2K bug but were actually just sitting on the Clinton Foundation payroll waiting for the next Clinton administration to begin.\n\nBut accusing either Clinton of being a Confederate sympathizer, past or present, is a conspiracy beneath even its creators.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:08.347+0000"}

She has also weighed in on the shooting of an unarmed black man in South Carolina\u2014\u201cPraying for #WalterScott\u2019s family. Heartbreaking & too familiar.

While most presidential campaigns strategize over how to get media attention, Clinton operatives are trying to figure out how to wrangle a ballooning press corps that for weeks has competed over such small-bore issues as which empty Brooklyn loft space will house her campaign headquarters and looked for meaning in every Clinton facial expression and utterance since 2012.\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have always been prodigious Democratic fundraisers, but they will enter the 2016 election cycle as newcomers to the post-Citizens United world of campaign finance. Super PACs associated with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), for example, have raised $31 million since he announced his campaign last week.

But he\u2019s getting the kind of airtime other candidates have to spend hundreds of millions to get.\n\nNot a day goes by, it seems, that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t lose money thanks to his notorious comments about Mexican immigrants. NBC, Univision, Macy\u2019s, and even Perfumania, which makes the Trump \u201cSuccess\u201d cologne, have all said \u201cno mas\u201d to The Donald.\n\nBecause of Donald\u2019s big mouth, I won\u2019t be even able to get that \u201cTrump Mattress\u201d from Serta I so long coveted. What is the world coming to?\n\nSo all this corporate backlash must be costing Donald a mint, right? Well, actually, no, because when you add it all up Trump has just paid chump change to get into the biggest show on earth, namely the race for the presidency.\n\nYes, all this cutting of ties has cost Trump money; Trump officials won\u2019t comment on the cost, but most estimates have Trump losing between $50 million and $80 million.\n\nHow did I get these numbers? Most of them aren\u2019t public and some of them aren\u2019t public and some have to be inferred through various press accounts. But I can tell you that when I bounced these estimates off Trump officials and some sources on Wall Street, they said they seemed reasonable.\n\nOK, sure: That\u2019s real cash to most people, but I\u2019ve seen billionaire Wall Street guys spend $50 million to build a home. If you believe the Donald is worth $1 billion, that\u2019s only 5 percent of his wealth. Obviously, if you believe he\u2019s worth what Forbes say he is (more than $4 billion) and Trump\u2019s own calculation (close to $9 billion), we\u2019re talking peanuts.\n\nKeep in mind what he\u2019s getting for all this, too. I haven\u2019t noticed a Trump television ad so far, but I\u2019ve seen Trump on TV plenty since his immigration comments. And I\u2019ve noticed something else: that he\u2019s now polling at the top of the GOP candidate list.\n\nThat makes Trump a far more savvy operator than most of his opponents and media critics, who think the Donald has destroyed his \u201cbrand\u201d and is bleeding money as he indulges his ego with a reckless, insult-filled presidential run.\n\nJust add up what Trump has lost so far: Most media reports say as many as 12 companies have severed ties with Trump since the \u201cMexicans are rapists\u201d comments. For what it\u2019s worth, as of press time, Trump\u2019s people say he\u2019s really only lost business with the aforementioned five companies: NBC, Univision, Perfumania, Macy\u2019s, and Serta.\n\nThat\u2019s because companies like ESPN and NASCAR had more tentative relationships with the Donald \u2014they merely rented Trump golf courses and other Trump venues for events, and his people tell me they\u2019ve already put down large down payments, which Trump will keep, and therefore profit twice since he will rent those venues out to others.\n\nGOP front-runner Jeb Bush and the nearly anointed Democrat Hillary Clinton are looking to raise a combined $4 billion to run for president. Trump says he will fund his campaign himself, which, at least on the surface, should make all this brand-damaging at least somewhat costly, right?\n\nBut Trump is a walking (and tweeting) PR machine, so how much money he really needs to spend on whatever he is doing is probably negligible. I bet he never spends a dime on ads, because he doesn\u2019t need to. The media will give him all the exposure he wants, and for free. He already has the kind of exposure that other candidates spend hundreds of millions on.\n\nYes, he has caused a firestorm with his disturbing (and, by all accounts, factually inaccurate) remarks about Mexican immigrants. And the long-term effects on his vaunted Donald Trump brand could be formidable, experts say.\n\nBut I\u2019m dubious that the Donald\u2019s brand will take that much of a hit. Since the days when he focused myopically on real estate, Trump\u2019s brand has been built on firing people on television and stirring up controversy, which drives a dedicated fan base to buy his perfume, watch him on television and golf at his high-end golf courses.\n\nAnd those people\u2014Trump\u2019s real base\u2014couldn\u2019t care less.\n\nMeanwhile, Donald, with his bad hair, power red tie and big mouth, is drawing huge crowds on the campaign trail, and has pulled into a virtual tie with Bush, a two-term former governor. Does he really want to be president? I\u2019ve always been skeptical. The Donald is all about building his name and brand into something bigger, which is really what his run for president is all about.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s people have assured me that the deal with Perfumania was a two-year deal that simply won\u2019t be renewed, which means I can luxuriate in the masculine scents of \u201cSuccess\u201d for the next two years, well after The Donald drops out of the race and when his brand has been taken to new heights.\n\nAnd all for a mere $50 million.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:09.122+0000"}
{"entityId": 1881, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The answer might define the future of the American left, which has split over race, party politics, and the power of protest since BLM activists targeted Bernie Sanders.\n\nLast Saturday, for the second time in a month, protesters who identified themselves as members of the Black Lives Matter movement leapt onstage to interrupt a speech by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.\n\n\u201cI was going to tell Bernie how racist this city is, even with all of these progressives, but you\u2019ve already done that for me,\u201d said Marissa Johnson, who was roundly booed before demanding and receiving a four-minute moment of silence for the death of Michael Brown, as Sanders stood behind her and fellow protester Mara Willaford.\n\nThe Seattle protest sparked a particularly strong counter-reaction, especially among the white liberals who form the core of Bernie Sanders\u2019s base. Sanders is not the front-runner to win his party\u2019s nomination. Many on both the left and right are asking: Why him?\n\nSanders currently trails Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, whose events have not yet been successfully interrupted, by 38 points in Quinnipiac\u2019s most recent national poll. He has made criminal justice reform a tentpole issue early in his campaign. Jeb Bush, who trails Republican front-runner Donald Trump by 10 points, allegedly reached out to local Black Lives Matter leaders a night before, then was shouted down at a campaign event less than 24 hours later.\n\nWhy protest Bernie and not Hillary? Why Jeb and not Trump?\n\nInterviews with 10 members of both local and national branches of Black Lives Matter\u2014as well as with the political campaigns they\u2019ve tested\u2014reveals no single, easy answer. It\u2019s one part logistical\u2014from the less stringent security of a second-tier candidate to the simple timing of a speech.\n\nAnd it is another part\u2014a larger part\u2014purely organizational.\n\nIn response to the death of unarmed black teen Trayvon Martin and the acquittal of his killer, activists Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal Tometi rallied together on Twitter to create visibility with a unified phrase: Black Lives Matter. As more black Americans \u2014like Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Freddie Gray\u2014were killed by police, the phrase gained prominence and resonance\u2014both on Twitter, and in the protests that would follow, nationwide.\n\n\n\nIn the process of trying to grow its message from a hashtag spawned by three activists into a national political movement, Black Lives Matter\u2014a decentralized organization with official and unofficial Facebook pages, meet-ups, and blogs throughout America and the world\u2014is splintering internally on how to express that message, and even defining what that message truly is.\n\nAfter all, when an article says Black Lives Matter interrupted a campaign event, who is a part of Black Lives Matter, anyway? The answer to that question is even harder to answer.\n\nThe answer to that question might be a small group of people who self-identify as a \u201cradical organization.\u201d The answer to that question might also be anyone.\n\nAnd the answer to that question might define the future of the American left, which has split over race, party politics, and the limits and powers of protesting since two activists took over a podium in Seattle seven days ago.\n\n***\n\nNikki Stephens, 16, was hit with a barrage of Facebook messages and texts on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cMy phone was blowing up,\u201d Stephens says. \u201cEveryone automatically assumed I was one of the two women\u201d\u2014the protesters who took over the Sanders event in Seattle.\n\nStephens, a high schooler and track athlete, had the keys to the \u201cBlack Lives Matter: Seattle\u201d Facebook page. She had \u201cwatched the video from all angles\u201d of Johnson and Willaford, and now\u2014as the de facto voice of Black Lives Matter: Seattle, she believed\u2014it was her turn to speak.\n\nShe had been drawn into the movement months ago by an activist who came to her school and compelled her to take action on the recent spate of young black men killed by police.\n\n\u201cI wanted to raise awareness\u2014that this is not a joke. That people are actually dying,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I made the page.\u201d\n\nWith the help and guidance of her friend, she started sharing stories of injustice and dispatches from the national chapter. Quickly, her page grew to be the largest Black Lives Matter page in Seattle.\n\nElaine Thompson/AP\n\nThen Johnson and Willaford, whom Stephens had never met, took over the podium at the Bernie Sanders\u2019s campaign event last weekend.\n\n\u201cI felt like I had to come up with a response,\u201d she says.\n\nThere was, however, a problem: Stephens is a Bernie Sanders supporter. Panicked, she called her friend who had gotten her into the movement to plan her next move.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018What should I do? I don\u2019t really know what to do,\u2019\u201d she says.\n\nAs the night progressed, she started receiving messages filled with hate, threats, and racial slurs\u2014especially, she says, from Bernie Sanders fans. They all wanted an apology\u2014one for something she didn\u2019t do.\n\nSo she crafted one.\n\n\u201cTo the people of Seattle and \u202a#\u200eBernieSanders\u202c I am so sorry for what happened today in Seattle. I am a volunteer who just runs this page and I am only just starting to get into the movement,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI was unaware of what happened and now that I\u2019ve seen the video [of the event] I would like to say again that I am sorry. That is not what Black Lives Matter stands for and that is not what we\u2019re about. Do not let your faith in the movement be shaken by voices of two people. Please do not question our legitimacy as a movement. Again I would like to apologize to the people of Seattle and I will be trying to reach out to Mr. Sanders.\u201d\n\nSome in the national media ran with it. \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 had apologized.\n\nThat\u2019s when Stephens received messages from both Marissa Johnson and Mara Willaford.\n\n\u201cOf course, you can\u2019t tell tone by text. But when they approached me, through texting, it felt sort of aggressive,\u201d says Stephens. \u201cBut it wasn\u2019t like they were mad. They were like, \u2018Who are you? Why\u2019d you start your page?\u2019\u201d\n\nThey told Stephens to change the name of her page\u2014that she had no claim to Black Lives Matter: Seattle.\n\nHowever, Willaford, 25, and Johnson, 23, had not been public leaders of any Black Lives Matter: Seattle pages up until the day of the event.\n\nAt 5:45 a.m. on Saturday, Johnson and Willaford created a separate Facebook page, also, confusingly enough, called \u201cBlack Lives Matter Seattle.\u201d At 6:35 p.m., they issued a press release\u2014the page\u2019s first post\u2014called \u201cBlack Lives Matter #BowDownBernie Action\u201d that listed Johnson as a press contact and was signed by both Johnson and Willaford.\n\nAt the bottom of the note, they are listed as \u201cBlack Lives Matter Seattle co-founders.\u201d\n\nJohnson and Willaford were previously leaders of the group Outside Agitators 206, an activist coalition based in Seattle. According to OA206\u2019s website, the fourth of the organization\u2019s four points of unity is this:\n\nJason Kempin/BET via Getty\n\n\u201cFuck the police: As an institution fundamentally rooted in white supremacy and anti-Blackness we reject the police presence in our communities, absolutely. It is our responsibility to hold each other accountable and keep each other safe.\u201d\n\nThe organization appeared largely dormant over the last several months. According to its website, the group\u2019s sole activity in July was the reposting of a Movement for Black Lives event invitation and an article from TheRoot.com.\n\nAfter the event, Stephens\u2014thinking she had accidentally claimed a page that wasn\u2019t her own and facing mounting pressure\u2014ceded the name of the page. She changed the name to \u201cBlack in Seattle.\u201d Willaford and Johnson\u2019s page was now the primary Black Lives Matter Seattle group on Facebook.\n\n\u201cThey said, \u2018We appreciate what you\u2019re doing. We appreciate you trying to be involved,\u2019\u201d she says of the texts. \u201c\u2018But it\u2019s not an official message. We\u2019ve gotten calls from the national people at Black Lives Matter.\u2019\u201d\n\nThen, later on, another Facebook group claiming to be a part of Black Lives Matter instead demanded Bernie Sanders and his Seattle-based organizers apologize to the movement. Some national media reported that as a Black Lives Matter response, as well.\n\nThe national Black Lives Matter Facebook page then posted a statement at 2:15 a.m. Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe \u202a#\u200eBlackLivesMatter\u202c organization did not create any petitions demanding apology from Seattle based organizers. We have not issued a public apology, neither have we made any public statements demanding an apology.\u201d\n\nSo who is Black Lives Matter in this situation? Did the movement send protesters to disrupt Bernie Sanders?\n\n\u201cThe point of disruption is to challenge business as usual, to really challenge the community of Seattle\u2014largely white liberals\u2014and their inability to see anti-black racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t. My chapter did,\u201d says Patrisse Cullors\u2014one of three people credited with starting and spreading the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag that was used to help grow a national movement. She\u2019s also the founder of Dignity and Power Now, a Los Angeles-based organization that works for the rights of incarcerated people and their families. \u201cWhat we do is we support the chapters. We support their local demands and goals. They tell us what they need us to build support around.\u201d\n\nCullors, 32, says she met up with Willaford at a Black Lives Matter national retreat and that they \u201ctalk all of the time,\u201d but she never gave direct instructions to interrupt Sanders\u2019s rally. She calls Willaford and Johnson\u2019s branch \u201ca very new chapter.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat chapter did all the work. And we supported it by ensuring they were a part of the chapter,\u201d says Cullors. \u201cIt\u2019s very rare there\u2019s a national directive for people to do things. We amplify and support.\u201d\n\nBut what about the leader of the larger Black Lives Matter Facebook group in Seattle\u2014one that existed publicly well before Johnson and Willaford got in front of a podium in Seattle?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure where she was coming from,\u201d says Cullors. \u201cI think what\u2019s important is that folks understand the point of disruption: to challenge business as usual, to really challenge the community of Seattle\u2014largely white liberals\u2014and challenging their inability to see anti-black racism, as a part of a larger pushback against the state.\u201d\n\nDoes she understand why there might be confusion over who has true ownership of the message in Seattle? If Stephens had publicly acted first and not Willaford and Johnson, would she not be in charge?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer that question,\u201d says Cullors. \u201cThere is a network called Black Lives Matter, with chapters and local affiliates. It could be very confusing for some to think it\u2019s all the same. There could be some that use our name, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it\u2019s in alignment with our message.\u201d\n\nCullors says there are now \u201cregistered chapters\u201d of the national Black Lives Matter movement, and cites Boston, Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and now Seattle as those who have filled out the necessary paperwork.\n\nBut a list of official chapters does not appear on the official Black Lives Matter website and is not publicly available, according to Cullors. There is no registration form on the official website and no statement noting that local Black Lives Matters groups must sign up with the national branch.\n\nWillaford and Johnson did not respond to repeated requests for comment by phone, email, and social media channels. And Cullors wanted to note that she has no problem with Stephens, herself\u2014in fact, she\u2019d like her to meet with Johnson and Willaford to see how she can help the movement\u2014but she believed the apology to be off-message.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to issue an apology trying to censor black folks,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cAnyone can be a Black Lives Matter activist,\u201d she adds. \u201cThat [statement] wasn\u2019t official.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe Seattle disruption exacerbated a nascent divide on the activist left between black and white progressives.\n\nSome white writers, like Gawker\u2019s Hamilton Nolan, wrote after the event that the Black Lives Matter movement was alienating the candidate that best served the movement\u2019s interests\u2014or, as he titled his post, \u201cDon\u2019t Piss On Your Best Friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany on the left find it hard to come out and say \u2018this was stupid,\u2019 because they support both Bernie Sanders and the Black Lives Matter movement,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is a misperception of the political landscape. Believing that a small group of angry young protesters did something that was not well thought out need not make you feel guilty or racist; rash and counterproductive things are what young people do.\u201d\n\nAfter criticism about the story surfaced\u2014including a piece in Death+Taxes titled \u201c Bernie Sanders Fans: White Paternalism Ain\u2019t Just for Conservatives \u201d\u2014New York magazine\u2019s Jonathan Chait took up Nolan\u2019s cause.\n\n\u201cBut maybe there is a more important question here than mere tactics,\u201d he wrote. \u201cPerhaps shutting down a political speech is, normatively, wrong.\u201d\n\nIn The New Republic, Jamil Smith took issue with some of the responses by white progressive media after the speech.\n\n\u201cThese are supposed to be the white people who want Black Lives Matter to succeed. These people were willing to throw black people under the bus for the white dude they want to win. That\u2019s the same anti-blackness energy that we\u2019re fighting against.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince when are protest tactics designed to make the people whom they are targeting feel more comfortable and less annoyed?\u201d he asked. \u201cAnd since when is Sanders, or (Republican presidential candidate Ben) Carson, or any candidate exempt from being pushed?\u201d\n\nHis story\u2019s title signified a rallying cry for what some protesters believe to be a growing fissure at the left end of American politics: \u201cBlack Lives Matters Protesters Are Not The Problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was most shocking to me about the reactions to the Bernie Sanders shutdown was the amount of rage from progressive white people for two African-American women who were standing up for what they believe in. The reaction was gross,\u201d Julius Jones, founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Worcester, Massachusetts, tells The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cThese are supposed to be the white people who want Black Lives Matter to succeed. These people were willing to throw black people under the bus for the white dude they want to win. That\u2019s the same anti-blackness energy that we\u2019re fighting against.\u201d\n\nBy late Saturday night, Nikki Stephens, a rising high school junior in Washington state, may have accidentally received the worst and most vocal of that hate\u2014and some of it from fans of the candidate she had already supported.\n\n\u201cI heard from so many people and, although you are liberal and you do support Bernie Sanders\u2014and you do say you support Black Lives Matter\u2014I saw a lot of them come out and say some very nasty things about the movement. There were so many people posting claiming to be liberals, then going back and using slurs, and perpetuating stereotypes. And the sexism I saw from men,\u201d she says, trailing off.\n\n***\n\nProtesters in Massachusetts\u2019 Black Lives Matters chapters say there\u2019s a simple logistical reason Bernie Sanders\u2019s speeches have been interrupted twice\u2014once in Seattle, and once before in Phoenix last month\u2014but Hillary Clinton hasn\u2019t yet been disrupted.\n\nThat reason? The Secret Service, which Boston Black Lives Matter activist Daunasia Yancey describes as \u201c50 men in the building who are willing to kill you.\u201d\n\nNeither Bernie Sanders nor Jeb Bush has those protective details. Hillary Clinton most certainly does.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re not to be pressed in any way. The Secret Service are very dangerous people, and their operation is protect their asset at all costs,\u201d said Jones, who was part of a group of activists who spoke to\u2014instead of protesting against\u2014Hillary Clinton last weekend in New Hampshire. \u201cTo be confronting an issue such as police brutality\u2014and then to tell that same group of people that they should go charge at the [former] first lady\u2014is a little shortsighted.\u201d\n\nYancey, 22, views Black Lives Matter as a \u201cradical\u201d group. But she says that rushing the stage with the intention of taking over the microphone at a Hillary Clinton campaign event is not viable.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a radical organization, with radical politics, and we have radical tactics. There\u2019s no way of softening that. But we are strategic, and we\u2019re interested in remaining safe and alive. Something like storming the stage was not a possibility with the Secret Service [present],\u201d Yancey says.\n\nAccording to New England-area Black Lives Matter activists like Yancey and Jones, they came to demonstrate at Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire event last weekend\u2014only to be offered a private meeting with the Democratic front-runner herself.\n\nBut the Clinton campaign has a slightly different story to tell about the night the former Secretary of State met with local Black Lives Matter reps. The campaign contends that the Black Lives Matter activists arrived late to the event and were unable to enter because the room was at capacity.\n\n\u201cThere were another 15 people who also came late and couldn\u2019t get in, so they all were taken to an overflow room. Our team on the ground offered to essentially swap some people out so that they could go into the town hall with Hillary but they declined and asked to meet with her after the event. She met with them for about 15 minutes after the event,\u201d a Clinton spokesperson tells The Daily Beast.\n\nSome activists for criminal justice reform, like Families Against Mandatory Minimums strategic initiatives director Kevin Ring, believe that Clinton is the candidate who deserves the most scrutiny for her previous stances on mass incarceration.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on her, more than others, to explain what precisely she got wrong, and what the country got wrong\u2014and what she would do to reverse that,\u201d Ring says.\n\nIn 1994, as the House and Senate were considering whether to pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, Clinton said (PDF), \u201cWe need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders. The \u2018three-strikes-and-you\u2019re-out\u2019 for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets.\u201d\n\nAs a senator running for the presidency, she opposed making shorter sentences for crack cocaine-related offenses retroactive for previously-convicted inmates, even though many advocates had called the disparity between crack and powder cocaine sentences unjust.\n\nBoth Bill and Hillary Clinton have backed away from the tough-on-crime reforms they championed in the mid-\u201990s. But, advocates say, since Hillary Clinton was involved in creating a climate of mass incarceration that disproportionately targets black Americans, she has a greater responsibility to address why and how her stances about the criminal justice system have changed.\n\nIn their private meeting with Hillary Clinton, members of the Black Lives Matter movement challenged her to reflect on \u201cher personal involvement in the war on drugs and the anti-black policies that were enacted by her family and throughout her career,\u201d Yancey says.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what we heard. We didn\u2019t hear the reaction that we wanted,\u201d Yancey adds.\n\nWhat they heard was talk about policy and legislation. Clinton told them that her previous positions on sentencing were due to a \u201cdifferent climate and a different set of problems\u201d in the \u201990s.\n\nWith the criminal justice reform that was passed in the \u201990s, Jones argues, the \u201cundercurrent of it is anti-blackness. What in her heart has changed\u2026 that will actually change the tide? And how can she use her change to be an example for the United States?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has acknowledged the failure of some of her work. It\u2019s just the next step: the acknowledgement of what\u2019s behind that,\u201d Yancey adds. \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s feelings about anti-blackness in our government are very important. She wasn\u2019t willing to go there with us, but it\u2019s a crucial conversation. If you\u2019re looking for solutions to the problem\u2026 [and] there\u2019s a form of white supremacy in your solutions, that\u2019s going to continue.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign contends that their candidate has been reaching out to the Black Lives Matter movement and was paying attention to criminal justice reform and social inequality.\n\n\u201c[O]n an ongoing basis our team has also been reaching out and talking to different parts of the BLM movement as well as a wide range of organizations, activists, stakeholders, etc. so that policy proposals are informed by many voices and experiences,\u201d a Clinton spokesperson tells The Daily Beast. \u201cHillary has been speaking out about Black Lives Matter and criminal justice reform for some time\u2026 it was the subject of her first policy speech of the campaign in April\u2026 in which she laid out specific policy proposals. In addition to criminal justice reform she has also broadened to talk about the opportunity gap and systemic inequities.\u201d\n\nTyrone Brown, a Seattle-based activist who says he \u201cspeaks with Black Lives Matter, but not for Black Lives Matter,\u201d says Bernie Sanders was disrupted at his event on Saturday in part \u201cbecause it was on the eve of the one-year anniversary of Michael Brown\u2019s death.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether it had been Clinton, Perry, or whoever\u2014if anybody had come to Seattle, something would have happened that day,\u201d he says. \u201cSomething would\u2019ve had to have happened to highlight it\u2014that tragedy. In this case, it was Bernie Sanders.\u201d\n\nBrown runs an initiative at Seattle University, where he\u2019s an administrator, called Moral Mondays at SU, which organizes events like talks, discussions, and movie nights as part of a \u201c#BlackLivesMatter initiative.\u201d\n\nBrown met Mara Willaford on the way back to Seattle after the Movement for Black Lives event in Cleveland. He says he now recognizes Willaford and Johnson as the leaders of Black Lives Matter Seattle.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the slight issue with some semantics around timing: How can they take an action before they become an official chapter for the movement? It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he says. \u201cIf no one had taken advantage of the fact that the front-runner for the Democratic nomination was speaking in Seattle on that day, somebody was going to take some type of action. They just happened to be the ones that did it.\u201d\n\n***\n\nAlthough she had to hand over the name to her Facebook group, Stephens says she now believes that the protest was ultimately good for the visibility of Bernie Sanders\u2014and that, days after the event, she sees where Willaford and Johnson were coming from.\n\n\u201cWatching social media after it happened, I came to realize what they were doing. A lot of people wrote in saying that it made them want to learn about Bernie Sanders,\u201d she says. \u201cThey inadvertently had done their job\u2014even if that wasn\u2019t their aim.\u201d\n\nStephens hasn\u2019t heard from Johnson or Willaford since she relinquished the name of the page. She said she\u2019d like to continue her activism, but was discouraged by her experience on Saturday night.\n\n\u201cThis really brought out the worst in people,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWe have waited and waited and waited. Two more people dead in Ferguson. We can\u2019t take a back seat anymore. I want people to clear their minds of what happened, to stop making it about the women [who interrupted Sanders\u2019s speech]. What did you do?

As he ascended to begin his remarks, a stagehand scrambled to pull a heavy Liberty University lectern off the stage.\n\nCruz\u2019s campaign launch had more the feel of a teen Saturday night Christian worship concert than, for example, the grand, formal setting of the Old State Capitol in Illinois, where Barack Obama launched his presidential campaign in 2007.\n\nIn fact, Cruz\u2019s speech was preceded by 25 minutes of worship music\u2014were it not for the lyrics, you might have felt like you were at a loud Jonas Brothers concert, pulsing bass and all. Attendance at convocation was mandatory for students, so Cruz was guaranteed a full house.\n\nCruz started with an introduction of his parents: mother who was a pioneer in computer science, and his father, who left Cuba.\n\nThe Texas senator spoke at length about how his father had abandoned his mother and him when Cruz was 3, before converting to Christianity and returning to the family.\n\nIt was every bit the core of his sermon: a tale of sin and then redemption, as fitting for the Texas senator as the delivery and intonations of televangelist Joel Osteen.\n\n\u201cI want to talk to you this morning about reigniting the promise of America,\u201d Senator Ted Cruz said.\n\n\u201cThere are people who wonder if faith is real. I can tell you in my family there is not a second of doubt. For were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ, I would have been raised by a single mother without a father in the household,\u201d Cruz told the crowd.\n\nIt was a fitting setting: Cruz, the Christian Baptist, launched his campaign at Liberty University which was founded in the \u201970s as a Baptist college by Jerry Falwell Sr. It has has grown to become the largest evangelical Christian university in the world.\n\nCruz riffed on the aspirational imaginations of the crowd. Imagine a better economy, or a better education for every American child, or a government that upholds the Second Amendment, he said, gesturing. This instead of the government you have know, he added.\n\n\u201cImagine a simple tax.\u201d \u201cImagine a president that finally, finally, finally secures the borders.\u201d \u201cImagine young people with four, five, six job offers.\u201d\n\n\u201cInstead of a government that seizes your emails and your cellphones.\u201d \u201cInstead of a federal government that seeks to dictate school curriculum through common core.\u201d \u201cInstead of the joblessness, instead of the millions forced into part-time work.\u201d\n\nIt was the cadence of a televangelist, all the way down to the mic hooked up to his ear and wrapped down the right side of his face, wandering to all eight sides of the stage to talk to different segments of the deeply Christian crowd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been excited about Ted Cruz for some time,\u201d said attendee Bryce Hardy, near the front row, who said he preferred either Cruz or Kentucky Senator Rand Paul for the nomination. \u201cThey\u2019re willing to go against the grain. They don\u2019t appear wishy-washy. \u2018This is who I am, take it or leave it.\u2019 I like that mentality.\u201d\n\nRandy Marroquin, a student, and Brenda Sheets, a retired Liberty University graduate, had met in the front row of the Cruz event.

{"entityId": 1883, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Last week, Sheryl Sandberg, the Facebook executive famous for Lean In, the book and female-empowerment marketing campaign, announced an expansion called #leanintogether. The new twist is that it pulls men into the movement, telling them how to help women get ahead in the workplace and at their homes, and it roped in spokesmanship help from the likes of Warren Buffett and LeBron James.\n\nAlmost immediately, think pieces over whether this was actually good for women\u2014or rather, all women\u2014followed. It\u2019s not a new fight. Arguments over Sandberg, especially within the left and in the world of feminism, go back to even before the book came out.\n\nIn part, this is because Sandberg is perceived to be writing about and working to address challenges faced by a small group of elite women, those who have piled up the fancy degrees, racked up experience in the corporate world, and arguably should be shattering the glass ceiling into a million little pieces but are not. \u201cThe fact that she has more effectively rallied corporate leaders of both genders around the campaign than she has rallied women of different socioeconomic classes is very telling about who the campaign is for,\u201d the journalist Sarah Leonard told The New Yorker\u2019s Vauhini Vara.\n\nMore controversial is that rather than address the structural barriers that prevent women from getting ahead in the workplace, Sandberg has decided to speak directly to women about the ways they internalize sexism and lower expectations for themselves in the workplace. Many see this individualized approach as wrong-headed. Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig, writing this week in The New Republic, took that one step further and argued that the way Sandberg conducts her campaigns risks hurting lower-wage women. \u201cSandberg\u2019s corporate feminism preaches individual female empowerment in the workplace (and now at home, too) rather than collective social action,\u201d she writes, \u201cand women who subscribe to that approach are more likely to funnel resources into advanced education and leadership training rather than into the machinery of politics and protest.\u201d\n\nOn the one hand, I don\u2019t disagree that there\u2019s a particular spirit to Sandberg\u2019s rallying cry that clashes with my own politics. I don\u2019t see why it wouldn\u2019t: Sandberg is a wealthy white woman who made her way through corporate America to help lead the social media behemoths that now rule us from their libertarian-leaning Silicon Valley perches, and that undoubtedly influenced her approach. She is not a social worker, a union organizer, or me, a journalist who writes about poverty and inequality.\n\nEven if Sandberg\u2019s advice isn\u2019t useful to women other than those in her milieu, I\u2019m not sure why that should be harmful to others.\n\nLet\u2019s stipulate that Sandberg\u2019s book probably doesn\u2019t do a whole lot for the very poor, for women who work in fields (literally and figuratively) where bosses steal their wages illegally and openly prevent them from advancing. I would disagree, though, that it\u2019s only for women in the top rungs, or that it doesn\u2019t inspire a sense of in-it-togetherness. One of the tools Sandberg\u2019s campaign launched was Lean In circles\u2014I was invited to join one by a friend, though I never really participated. People I know, and people who\u2019ve spoken about them, include not just elites but decidedly middle-class professionals. Many took from these sessions a sense that they were not alone with their struggles at work, and felt a kind of relief to learn they weren\u2019t imaging a subtle sexism coming from their bosses at work.\n\nWhich hints at, I think, Sandberg\u2019s biggest contribution to the world: She gave women permission to talk about their work, to take pride in it, and to admit they wanted to be successful. In most of American society women are still required to view their roles as mothers first, and the work they do in the home as paramount. \u201cThe idea that ambition shouldn\u2019t be hampered by gender is so commonplace as to need little defense,\u201d says Stoker Bruenig. \u201cThe same goes for the call for dads to be involved at home.\u201d But I think those ideas are more controversial in many pockets of the country than Stoker Bruenig would assume. Subtle grooming of women to lower their academic and professional expectations so that they\u2019re not let down or pulled away from home or family, the disdain with which men openly disregard the work women do at home\u2014those beliefs are more prevalent than many would like to believe in 2015.\n\nSandberg is rich and privileged, and was lucky enough to be able to hire nannies and other domestic help. That is undoubtedly help that most American women do not have. But what has been our stereotype of women like Sandberg? In the common understanding, corporate women who do become successful in the career world and hire people to help raise their children are bad moms, the mean mommy with a briefcase stereotype, or worse, cold-fish types, emotionally barren and child-hating, a la the 1987 film Baby Boom. Sandberg wrote unapologetically about her own climb and her own success, humanizing the image of a corporate woman, and announced that she is both a good mother who works a lot and has a nanny. That\u2019s helpful in chipping away at the stereotype.\n\nEven if Sandberg\u2019s advice isn\u2019t useful to women other than those in her milieu, I\u2019m not sure why that should be harmful to others. Some fear that if Sandberg encourages women to negotiate for things like paid maternity leave for themselves, it will take the air out of movements for universal reforms led by the government. That shouldn\u2019t necessarily be true. Most college graduates and powerful people negotiate pay and benefits packages that are higher than the minimum wage, but that hasn\u2019t dampened support for a minimum wage hike or universal paid-sick leave package. In fact, those reforms remain very popular.\n\nLaws ensuring that all workers have such basic benefits are already sweeping the nation, and we haven\u2019t arrived squarely in the 2016 campaign yet. Who knows where the women influenced by Sandberg will throw their political weight? There\u2019s no reason to think they wouldn\u2019t support candidates who will address the concerns they\u2019ve been talking about in their Lean In circles. Indeed, the voices of female politicians addressing the needs of women have only gotten louder since Lean In came out.\n\nLet\u2019s say Sandberg\u2019s sole goal is to raise the number of female CEO\u2019s and achieve parity in boardrooms, and that she only wants to make the world better for those women. Why should we care? It\u2019s not as though women in business are floating along on clouds of privilege with an easy life free of discrimination. Their privilege is relative, and just because other women have it worse than they do doesn\u2019t erase the challenges they face. At worst, it makes Sandberg a very visible and imperfect vehicle for the mantle of feminism, but surely it is better to have as many of those as possible rather than too few.\n\nWhy do people find Sandberg\u2019s advice so offensive? I think it\u2019s because she\u2019s speaking for herself, and encouraging other women to do the same. Women never speak solely on their own behalf. It violates an unspoken requirement that the first words we say must be, \u201cOh no, you go ahead,\u201d and that women must help others first.\n\nIt is possible to fight a battle on many fronts. Sure, leaning in won\u2019t end gender discrimination on its own; a claim, I would point out, Sandberg never makes. Indeed, she says she supports those who address structural problems rather than individual ones, a conflict she rather simplistically describes in her introduction as a chicken-and-egg problem.\u201c[R]ather than engage in philosophical arguments over which comes first, let\u2019s agree to wage battles on both fronts,\u201d she writes. \u201cI am encouraging women to address the chicken, but I fully support those who are focusing on the egg.\u201d\n\nAnd yet, mired in philosophical debates over the usefulness of Sandberg is where we\u2019ve been.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:10.537+0000"}

Come to think of it, this sounds perilously close to what a de-regulated Trump Organization might get up to someday if 2016 goes full comb-over. \u201cSaudi Arabia, they make $1 billion a day,\u201d Trump said this week: \u201c$1 billion a day.

He\u2019s got a tremendous popularity in Russia, they love what he\u2019s doing, they love what he represents. I was over in Moscow two years ago and I will tell you\u2014you can get along with those people and get along with them well. You can make deals with those people. Obama can\u2019t. I would be willing to bet I would have a great relationship with Putin. It\u2019s about leadership.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also about rubles. During the above-referenced visit to Moscow for\u2014what else?\u2014the 2013 Miss Universe contest, Trump declared \u201cplans for the establishment of business in Russia. Now, I am in talks with several Russian companies to establish this skyscraper.\u201d Trump didn\u2019t specify which companies, or which \u201cthis\u201d he was referring to or where the latest five-lettered behemoth might eventually pop up to deliver its mirrored charms to \u201cthose people.\u201d But according to Kremlin propaganda organ Russia Today, the mogul struck up a friendly rapport with oligarch developer Araz Agalarov, owner of Crocus City Hall, which served as the venue for Miss Universe 2013. That pageant, of course, is co-owned by Trump and NBC Universal. \u201cHow \u2019bout you, sweetheart? What would you do to change the world with me in the Oval?\u201d \u2026 \u201cIskander missiles in Kaliningrad, Order of Lenin for Snowden, and world peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would be willing to bet I would have a great relationship with Putin.\u201d\n\n\n\nUnited Arab Emirates. Donald Trump Townhouses and Villas is working with an Emirati firm called DAMAC Properties to build the Trump International Golf Course in Dubai, much of it constructed by foreign workers who make between $150 and $300 a month after landing and having their passports confiscated by their contractor employers in a modern form of indentured servitude\u2014they have to pay for the privilege of coming over to work under such conditions.\n\nA year ago, artist Molly Crabapple confronted Trump at a press conference in Dubai to ask if he was pleased that those building his Gulf paradise made such a pittance. He refused to answer the question because it wasn\u2019t sufficiently of the softball variety he and his press handlers had expected of their audience. You know, the kind whereby he\u2019d be asked to expand on his prior observation that \u201cthe world has so many problems and so many failures, and you come here and it\u2019s so beautiful. Why can\u2019t we have that in New York?\u201d (The minimum-wage and 13th Amendment just get in the way.)\n\nNorth Korea. Well, really this was a cudgel taken up on behalf of Dennis Rodman, our goodwill ambassador to the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea and, more important, a onetime contestant on Celebrity Apprentice. \u201cYou look at the world; the world is blowing up around us. Maybe Dennis is a lot better than what we have,\u201d Trump said of the athlete who praised the dictator of the world\u2019s only remaining Stalinist slave state as a \u201cgood-hearted kid.\u201d Granted, this was before Kim had his defense minister killed with anti-aircraft guns for nodding off during a compulsory military parade\u2014and possibly because he ran out of his other favored instruments of execution, mortars and flamethrowers.\n\nRodman came back from one of his trips to Pyongyang and declared that what Kim wants most of all is for Obama to pick up the phone and rap at him. Trump thinks this sounds like a plan. \u201cMaybe that is not the worst thing, folks, instead of going through this whole charade we do every year,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the worst thing that somebody actually calls, because this world is just blowing up around us. We are doing nothing. It\u2019s not a very big deal to make a phone call.\u201d Flamethrowers, dude.\n\nEgypt. Now here The Donald has shown himself to be very presidential with a little strategic flip-floppery. When Tahrir Square kicked off in early 2011, he was glad to see the back of Hosni Mubarak, telling a group of reporters, when the Egyptian strongman delegated responsibility to his vice president: \u201cSo far, things are looking all right. [Mubarak] lives in tremendous estates all over the world. Supposedly, he\u2019s taken $50 to $70 billion. Is this the kind of a leader they want? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\nNearly a year later, however, Trump thought so very much, since by then he was harping on doom-and-gloom for the most populous Arab state. In November 2011, he tweeted: \u201cEgypt is turning into a hot bed of radical Islam. The current protest is another coup attempt. We should never have abandoned Mubarak.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s one influential billionaire Egyptian who\u2019d likely agree with Trump\u2019s latter assessment and who has already endorsed him for president: Naguib Sawiris, the second-richest man in Egypt, tweeted yesterday, \u201cI think i ll support Donald Trump for next US presidency elections,a successful entrepreneur did well for himself will do well for America !\u201d\n\nSawiris, the Coptic founder and chairman of telecom giant Orascom TMT Holding, was a prominent backer of Tamarrod, the ostensibly youth-led protest movement against the Muslim Brotherhood-led government of former Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi. He was a principal, albeit quiet, financier and organizer of the \u201crebellion,\u201d which culminated in a military coup two years ago by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, now the current president. Sawiris lent all the ample resources at his disposal, and that of his political party the Free Egyptians, to help topple Morsi, including a television network and Egypt\u2019s largest privately owned newspaper. \u201cTamarrod did not even know it was me!\u201d he gushed to The New York Times in July 2013. \u201cI am not ashamed of it.\u201d Silent investors make the world go round; they also guard you while you sleep.

{"entityId": 1885, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A reminder that former UFW chief Dolores Huerta, the left\u2019s favorite Latina activist, wasn\u2019t always so pro-immigration.\n\nOur Spanish phrase of the day is \u201csin verguenza.\u201d It means someone without shame. As in: Dolores Huerta\u2014the East Coast liberal establishment\u2019s favorite Hispanic and someone who is held up as an iconic labor leader and civil rights figure\u2014is a sin verguenza.\n\nThe former vice president of the United Farm Workers union has long exploited her celebrity status. Now, in the 2016 election, Huerta is opportunistically working with People for the American Way, a Washington, D.C.-based liberal organization that has never shown the slightest interest in Latinos or their concerns, in a campaign designed to use the immigration issue to influence Latino voters.\n\n\u201cI believe the Latino community can be the \u2018deciders\u2019 and we saw that happen in the 2008 election and the 2012 election,\u201d Huerta recently told the Latino-themed news site Latin Post.\n\nHuerta\u2019s message to Latino voters\u2014as sponsored by People for the American Way\u2014is a variation on something that she said during a speech at a Tucson, Arizona, high school in 2006: \u201cRepublicans hate Latinos.\u201d So be sure to vote Democratic.\n\nThe goal is to discredit any 2016 Republican hopeful who might have a shot at winning Latino votes. Huerta\u2019s targets so far include Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and former Florida Governor Jeb Bush.\n\nAbout Rubio, she said to Latin Post: \u201dI think that he [Rubio] is a person we cannot trust because I think he's an opportunist and he's going to say what he needs to say just to get himself elected. He speaks out of both sides of his mouth.\u201d\n\nAbout Cruz, she said the senator was, through his opposition to Obamacare, at least partially responsible for the \u201chundreds and thousands\u201d of Texans without health insurance.\n\nAnd about Bush, she said the GOP establishment favorite can\u2019t be trusted: \u201cHe\u2019s another one that first he\u2019s against immigration and then says he\u2019s for immigration.\u201d\n\nThe left\u2019s strategy of using Huerta to launch these attacks is based on three assumptions: that Latinos care about immigration above other issues; that Latinos will vote for candidates who are vouched for by other Latinos; and that\u2014when Latino Republicans like Cruz and Rubio need to be attacked\u2014the optics are better when other Latinos fire the salvos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a question of your surname or the language that you can speak,\u201d Huerta told Latin Post. \u201cIt\u2019s a question about what values you hold.\u201d\n\nEven as someone who has given lip service to empowering Latinos politically, Huerta went on to explain why she wants a woman (Clinton) in the White House and not a Hispanic Republican (Rubio or Cruz). In other words, ethnicity and language take a back seat to gender and party affiliation.\n\nWhat makes this ploy of using immigration as a battering ram against Republicans not just cynical but offensive is that\u2014despite Huerta\u2019s recent efforts to re-invent herself as some kind of immigrant advocate\u2014she is nothing of the kind.\n\nThat is not who is she now, or who she has ever been. Huerta is a labor leader pure and simple, and, as such, she spent most of her activist career standing next to union members who, convinced that immigrants take jobs and lower wage for U.S. workers, want less immigration, not more of it.\n\nThat story is as old as the hills. It\u2019s why the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act\u2014the last significant comprehensive immigration reform measure passed by Congress\u2014was strongly opposed by the AFL-CIO and other labor groups.\n\nWe\u2019re supposed to be believe that it\u2019s all different now. The narrative cooked up by liberals and the media is, sometime during the last quarter-century, organized labor learned to stop worrying about foreign competition and embraced immigration.\n\nBut that\u2019s fiction. It never happened. The labor movement is more committed than ever to defeating immigration reform efforts that include a path to citizenship for the undocumented. The only difference is now organized labor has learned to be craftier in camouflaging its true agenda.\n\nJust like Huerta, who is obviously hoping that\u2014on the topic of immigration\u2014Latinos will be long on outrage toward Republicans and short on memory when it comes to the UFW.\n\nWe\u2019re not supposed to remember that, 40 years ago, the union\u2014which Huerta claims she co-founded\u2014was routinely criticized by Latino leaders like Bert Corona, a community organizer and co-founder of the Mexican-American Political Association, for demanding that the Immigration and Naturalization Service send agents into the fields to arrest and deport illegal immigrants who had crossed the picket line.\n\nWe\u2019re not supposed to remember that, in 1973, UFW officials set up a \u201cwet line\u201d on the Arizona-Mexico border to prevent Mexican immigrants from crossing into the United States. Under the supervision of Cesar Chavez\u2019s cousin, Manuel, who was something of a loose cannon, union members physically attacked the immigrants until they were bloody. At the time, The Village Voice scolded the UFW for conducting a \u201ccampaign of random terror against anyone hapless enough to fall into its net.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve recalled this history directly to Huerta, in face-to-face confrontations at various events in California that quickly turned ugly.\n\nAnd we\u2019re not supposed to remember that, in 1979, Chavez testified before Congress\u2014not to demand more protection for illegal immigrants but to demand that the INS do a better job of removing them from the fields.\n\nI\u2019ve recalled this history directly to Huerta, in face-to-face confrontations at various events in California that quickly turned ugly. On the defensive, she insisted none of it ever happened, and claimed that she can say this definitely because, not only does she speak for the union, she in fact \u201cis\u201d the union. The woman is either in denial, dishonest, or delusional.\n\nHuerta will have a tougher time explaining away her more recent betrayal of the Latino community. As an outspoken supporter of Hillary Clinton in 2008, Huerta blasted Barack Obama as not responsive to Latino concerns, calling him a \u201cJohnny come lately\u201d to the cause. She even took umbrage to the Obama campaign\u2019s slogan\u2014\u201cYes we can!,\u201d\u2014which she insisted sounded a lot like the UFW\u2019s rallying cry of \u201cSi se puede.\u201d\n\n\u201dNow they're copying our slogan,\" she told a reporter at the time. \"But you cannot build a relationship no m\u00e1s con una palabra\u2014just with one word.\u201d\n\nEventually, the relationship between Obama and Huerta improved. In 2010, the president invited Huerta to a state dinner at the White House honoring Mexican President Felipe Calderon. In 2012, Obama presented Huerta with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\n\nNow\u2014despite the fact that Obama broke his promise to make comprehensive immigration reform a top priority of his presidency, deported more than 2 million people, divided hundreds of thousands of families, and falsely claimed that those who were removed were predominantly criminals\u2014Huerta sings the praises of the Johnny Come Lately she once criticized.\n\nLet\u2019s see, Huerta accuses Republicans running for president of being blinded by ideology, flip-flopping on immigration, and selling out. She should know. She is an expert on these things.\n\nThis is our leader, our moral compass? Says who?\n\nWhite liberals may have decided among themselves that Dolores Huerta represents Latinos, but she only represents herself. She is an opportunist. She bartered away her credibility. And she needs to spend the 2016 election where she belongs: on the sidelines.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:11.080+0000"}

Donald Trump is speaking with them tonight.\n\nOn Friday night, future American President Donald Trump is scheduled to headline a private dinner at Los Angeles\u2019s Luxe Sunset Boulevard Hotel, where he will address Friends of Abe. The invitation to this sold-out event identifies Trump as the \u201cvery definition of American success.\u201d Due to Trump\u2019s recent controversy-courting comments regarding undocumented immigrants, interest in the Trump dinner shot through the roof.\n\nBut what, exactly, is Friends of Abe?\n\nFOA is a secretive group of Hollywood right-wingers (the \u201cone and only fellowship for entertainment industry conservatives\u201d) that formed in early 2005. It has been described as a \u201cstealth right-wing group,\u201d \u201cinfluential in conservative circles,\u201d a \u201cGOP support group,\u201d and as operating under \u201cthe same PR rules as Fight Club.\u201d\n\nThe full list of FOA members is kept under lock-and-key (to avoid potential blacklisting in a decidedly left-wing Tinseltown), and the group only recently achieved nonprofit status from the IRS after a three-year fight to do so.\n\nFounding and high-profile \u201cfriends\u201d include Gary Sinise, Kelsey Grammer, Patricia Heaton, Clint Eastwood, Jon Voight, and Oscar-nominated screenwriter Lionel Chetwynd. The hundreds of right-leaning members are invited to attend strictly off-the-record functions where Hollywood players get the chance to meet political celebrities, and also to network with like-minded entertainment-industry types. Past events have included a speech by Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, summer fiestas, a pie-baking contest and family picnic.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a growing movement, and word is getting out that there\u2019s many of us in this business,\u201d singer Pat Boone, an FOA associate, told The Washington Times in 2008. \u201cIf certain studio execs\u2014hirers and firers\u2014learn that this is a movement and growing, and that some of these people that they hire are of this inclination, these people could be unemployed.\u201d\n\nTrump is just the latest in a long line of Republican candidates and VIPs to speak before Friends of Abe. The group has recently hosted and toasted fellow 2016 contenders Rand Paul, Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina, and Mike Huckabee, and previously welcomed heavyweights such as Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Paul Ryan, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, Dick Cheney, Rush Limbaugh, and Ann Coulter. FOA gatherings have become opportunities for candidates to explore potential support and future fundraising opportunities, much in the same way President Obama and so many other Democratic politicians fly into Hollywood to meet and charm their famous fans, prospective donors, and potential bundlers and celebrity campaign-season allies.\n\n\u201cFriends of Abe has absolutely no political agenda,\u201d Jeremy Boreing, the organization\u2019s executive director (who also serves as managing editor at right-wing media watchdog TruthRevolt), told The New York Times last year. \u201cIt exists to create fellowship among like-minded individuals.\u201d (Boreing did not immediately respond to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment.)\n\nDue to the hyper-secretive nature of this Hollywood-elite fellowship, the renewed attention to the organization might not be the most comfortable thing for its more discretion-minded members. On Friday evening, Friends of Abe and their guest of honor Donald Trump will be met by a group of protesters. \u201cWe're going to be having a pi\u00f1ata to show how much of a caricature Mr. Trump has become,\u201d Jorge-Mario Cabrera, communications director at the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, said on Wednesday. (Cabrera was obviously not pleased with Trump\u2019s comments regarding Mexican \u201crapists\u201d and \u201craping.\u201d)\n\nFriends of Abe maintains that they have zero interest in endorsing a candidate or his or her controversial statements.\n\n\u201cWe invited Mr. Trump for the same reason we invite all of our speakers: to give our members a chance to hear from movement conservatives without the filter of the media so they can reach their own conclusions,\" the group told the Los Angeles ABC station.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article quoted websites that do not actually belong to Friends of Abe.

When Hewitt asked if he would shut down the markets in Colorado and Washington if he became president, he said he would \u201chave to think about it,\u201d saying \u201cthe federal government\u2019s decided to kind of look the other way.\u201d\n\nThen he said Ohio\u2019s ballot initiative would \u201clegalize drugs\u201d (even though it would legalize just one drug, singular).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally opposed to it, because it is a scourge in this country,\u201d the governor continued.\n\nHewitt concluded that Kasich must be undecided\u2014and thus, perhaps, wishy-washy\u2014as to whether to have federal law enforcement shut down Washington and Colorado\u2019s weed markets. Then Kasich took the opportunity to flex his drug-warrior bona fides.\n\n\u201cLet me tell you this though,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cIn my state and across this country, if I happen to be president, I would lead a significant campaign down at the grassroots level to stomp these drugs out of our country. We\u2019re doing it in Ohio in a variety of ways\u2014through education, prosecution\u2014and it\u2019s an unbelievably serious problem.\u201d\n\nThen he cited a New York Times story on heroin.\n\n\u201cThese are horrific things, and I\u2019ll have to think about it,\u201d Kasich added.\n\nHewitt then retorted that Colorado and Washington hobble anti-drug efforts by \u201cpumping tons of marijuana into the national marketplace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know what, you may be right,\u201d Kasich replied. \u201cI just want to give it some thought.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for Kasich\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t confirm if said thought has had results.\n\nAnd Justin Buchler, associate professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, offered an explanation for Kasich\u2019s lack of thought on the issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s never really been his primary focus as a politician,\u201d Buchler said. \u201cIf you look at Kasich\u2019s career, it tends to suggest that he is more interested in budgets. That means that he is not going to devote a lot of his time and energy to social issues.\u201d\n\nThere is one silver lining for Kasich and his fellow anti-drug crusaders\u2014many advocates of marijuana legalization hate the amendment that will likely end up on the Ohio ballot as much as they do (well, not really, but close).\n\nThat\u2019s because it only allows for 10 pot farms, in specific geographic locations. And\u2014big surprise!\u2014the companies that own those farms are the major investors in the legalization campaign, according to Cleveland.com. Not shady at all.\n\nTyler Henson, the president of the Colorado Cannabis Chamber of Commerce, said the proposed change is a terrible way to make weed legal.\n\n\u201cWhen you have only 10 growers to supply an entire state with such a large population as Ohio, there is bound to be price-fixing and collusion,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur industry is slowly bringing back that American Dream, that ideal that anyone in the U.S. can start a business and make something and provide a better life for their family,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe\u2019re exercising the true American Dream, and unfortunately I don\u2019t see Ohio\u2019s amendment as doing that.\u201d\n\nSo, oddly enough, in a roundabout way, Kasich may be able to make common cause with some of the most devoted supporters of legal marijuana.\n\nBut don\u2019t expect their mutual opposition to be a gateway to friendship.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:11.625+0000"}

But it\u2019s probably not true anyway.\n\nFew moments from debates are actually remembered by voters come Election Day, let alone years later. But some are, and Senator Lloyd Bentsen telling Senator and fellow aspiring Vice President Dan Quayle \u201cSenator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u201d is high on the list of such moments. Then-Senator Barack Obama telling fellow primary candidate Senator Hillary Clinton during the 2008 election \u201cyou\u2019re likable enough\u201d is another. It is widely believed that Obama\u2019s perceived condescension that moment actually made him appear less likable and helped lead to Clinton\u2019s win in New Hampshire. However, it didn\u2019t alter the crucial fact: Many people believe Hillary Clinton has a likability problem.\n\nWhile much has changed in the seven years since her last presidential run, this has not. And in fact, with the increasingly damaging coverage of emailgate and her family foundation\u2019s finances, it\u2019s possible she is becoming less likable to voters, not more. The only difference is this time her competition could end up being even less likable than she is\u2014or at the very least just \u201clikable enough,\u201d which is to say not all that likable. The long-held wisdom has been that while qualities like experience matter, they ultimately may not be as important to a lot of voters as which candidate they just like more\u2014which, to use the cliche, they\u2019d rather have a beer with.\n\nFor years, the beer standard has been used to gauge which presidential candidate is winning the likability Olympics. More undecided voters preferred a drink with reformed party animal turned teetotaler George W. Bush to the more staid John Kerry, who lost. It is widely believed that likability played a key role in President Obama winning a second term in office, despite a tough term that included dealing with a sagging economy. But what happens when voters end up having to choose between two candidates they don\u2019t want to have a beer with, bowl with, barbecue with, salsa with, party with, etc.? Will 2016 finally become the year voters based their choice on unsexy attributes like managerial experience?\n\nAlong with Clinton, there are other 2016 potential contenders with personality problems of their own. In contrast to his brother, who was practically charmer-in-chief, Jeb Bush is so widely known to be an introvert that this has already been a point of reference in multiple articles\u2013and the campaign\u2019s just getting started.\n\nAnd Rand Paul is already having to trot out his spouse to \u201chumanize\u201d him with voters\u2014particularly women\u2014after losing his cool in multiple interviews, most infamously one with The Today Show\u2019s Savannah Guthrie. The fact that his family is having to play defense this early does not bode well. Meanwhile, Senator Ted Cruz would have a tough time winning a popularity contest in his own party, let alone nationwide.\n\nBut according to some experts, Paul\u2019s burgeoning likeability problem and the personality challenges of some of his peers may not matter nearly as much as those of us covering the election like to think that it does. \u201cEmpirical evidence suggests that personality does not play the decisive role for the outcome of elections that journalists and political commentators often attribute to it,\u201d said Andreas Graefe in an email. Graefe has studied the impact of candidate personalities on election outcomes extensively.\n\n\u201cOne of the most important factors that determines the election outcome is beyond the control of the candidates: the state of the economy.\u201d\n\nIn his examination of presidential elections from 1972 to 2012 he found that, \u201cWhile candidates with the more favorable personality tend to win more often, the effect that can be attributed to personality is rather small after accounting for other factors. In other words, the candidate with the more favorable personality usually would have won anyway.\u201d\n\nJamal Simmons, who served as press secretary for multiple Democratic presidential campaigns, echoed this sentiment. Simmons argued that the whole \u201cWho would you have a beer with\u201d concept has been overhyped and overplayed. While he said who voters are okay with seeing appear on their television every single day for four years, as a president does, may play a small role in their decision-making, ultimately, \u201cI think people vote for who they trust the most.\u201d He added, \u201cYou can like somebody such as Ron Paul\u2014he seemed so likable, but you wouldn\u2019t vote for that person for president. Rick Perry seemed like a fun guy, but his campaign did not make you think you wanted this guy to have his finger over the button.\u201d\n\nSimmons noted that even among those who really like President Obama, some now feel he would have benefited from more managerial experience. It is possible this time around that feeling may benefit a candidate like Clinton or Bush, who are both perceived as experienced managers.\n\nTo this point, Graefe noted that, \u201cOne of the most important factors that determines the election outcome is beyond the control of the candidates: the state of the economy. When casting their vote, voters look at how they economy is doing and blame the incumbent government for bad performance, or reward it for good performance. Thus, the election can be seen as a referendum on the state of the economy. That said, when the incumbent is not running, such as in 2016, candidate qualities do become more important.\u201d He pointed to experience as one of them.\n\nSimmons challenged the idea that this campaign may lack a viable candidate who also has charisma, noting Florida Senator Marco Rubio could prove to be a serious contender.\n\nBut for those other candidates who may not have been born with Rubio\u2019s ease with public speaking, media trainer Jane Praeger said being authentic is more important than trying to be some perfect candidate. \u201cYou can\u2019t fake charisma, but you can make a genuine connection with voters. For example, last time around, while trying to look \u2018tough enough\u2019 to be president, Hillary masked her natural humor, liveliness and warmth\u2014some of her greatest assets.\u201d\n\nAs Simmons concluded, \u201cThere\u2019s no Mother Theresa or Gandhi on the ballot. You\u2019re not voting for a perfect human being.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:11.885+0000"}

And the Ferguson protests that gripped the nation last summer have left Nixon hobbled, according to Missouri politicos.\n\n\u201cNot only is he a lame duck, but he carries the legacy of Ferguson with him now wherever he goes,\u201d said Tim Jones, former Republican Speaker of the House. \u201cHe is vilified by Democrats and Republicans on nearly a daily basis.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving that dark cloud over the general assembly inhibits our ability to do the job which we\u2019re elected to do, which is to help Missourians,\u201d said Democratic Representative Gina Mitten.\n\nSince the St. Louis suburb became a metonym for everything that\u2019s wrong with American policing and race relations, the state\u2019s legislature hasn\u2019t been particularly kind to the governor.\n\nRepublican legislators have overridden his vetoes with alacrity, using their formidable majorities to implement a 72-hour waiting period for abortions and to allow gun owners with concealed-carry permits to openly carry their weapons anywhere in the state.\n\nThis is where Right to Work comes in.\n\nOn May 12, Republican state senators used an unusual procedural move to stop a filibuster on the Right to Work legislation and pass it through the chamber. Democrats raged against the move, an the Belleville News-Democrat reported that Republican Senator Bob Dixon criticized the action too.\n\nRepublicans in the legislature have been cautiously optimistic about their prospects of overturning Nixon\u2019s inevitable veto.\n\n\n\nThe initial votes on the bill didn\u2019t pass with the requisite two-thirds majorities per chamber to guarantee an override. And corralling the necessary votes won\u2019t be a walk in the park. To get the override, Republicans would need 23 votes in the Senate\u2014where it initially passed 21-13\u2014and 109 votes in the House, where 91 members voted for Right to Work in February.\n\nThough Republicans have two-thirds majorities in both chambers, some of those members of their members don\u2019t relish backing the controversial legislation. Getting enough stragglers on board with the legislation will likely take blood, sweat, tears, and a lot of arm-twisting. Assuming Nixon vetoes Right to Work (an iminently safe assumption), the legislature would vote to override sometime in September.\n\nThat\u2019s why Diehl\u2019s sexting fiasco matters.\n\nThanks to a tawdry relationship, House Republicans have a time-consuming, soul-sucking mess on their hands. As of late afternoon Wednesday, 30 of the chamber\u2019s Democrats had signed a petition that would force a vote requiring Diehl to step down as Speaker. They\u2019d need 82 signatories to make that vote happen.\n\n\u201cHaving that dark cloud over the general assembly inhibits our ability to do the job which we\u2019re elected to do, which is to help Missourians,\u201d said Representative Gina Mitten, who is circulating the petition.\n\nIf more details about Diehl\u2019s relationship with the student emerge, and if they\u2019re as ugly as the ones already in the press, the calls for his resignation could intensify. That would force the chamber\u2019s top Republicans to scramble for new leadership in the midst of an aggressive lobbying effort in favor of the historic anti-union legislation.\n\nAnd it would make everything more complicated.\n\nOpponents of Right to Work are crossing their fingers that it will play out that way. Jeff Mazur, the executive director of AFSCME Council 72 in Jefferson City, said he doubted Republicans would be able to get the votes regardless.\n\nBut, he added, the sexting scandal is only helpful to the pro-labor side.\n\nState Representative Gail McCann Beatty, the assistant minority floor leader, said she was agnostic as to how the now-public sexts could impact the fate of Right to Work. She also said Diehl needs to step aside.\n\n\u201cI think if we are going to maintain public trust, then we should be looking at different leadership,\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s an open question as to whether Republicans\u2019 trust problem will be Labor\u2019s win.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:12.546+0000"}

It may raise and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence elections, even though Savader himself can\u2019t vote. That\u2019s because he\u2019s serving a 30-month sentence in federal prison for cyberstalking and extortion after pleading guilty in November 2013 to the crimes.\n\nA budding political activist who attended George Washington University in Washington, D.C., Savader had previously volunteered for the 2012 presidential campaigns of Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich.\n\nAround the same time, Savader was hacking into women\u2019s email accounts, stealing nude photos of them and threatening to publish the pictures unless they sent more, according to court filings.\n\nSeveral campaign finance lawyers, normally hard to surprise, said this appears to be the first super PAC set up by someone currently imprisoned.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a new one,\u201d Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer at law firm Akerman LLP, told the Center for Public Integrity. \u201cI\u2019ve seen former convicted people come out of prison and run for Congress again, but never saw someone set up a committee while in prison.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is a first,\u201d said Michael Toner, a former Federal Election Commission chairman who\u2019s now a lawyer at Wiley Rein. \u201cI haven\u2019t recalled this. It really does show you how omnipresent super PACs are today.\u201d\n\nPaperwork for Second Chance PAC lists Savader as the group\u2019s treasurer, custodian of records, and \u201cfounder / director.\u201d It also notes the PAC doesn\u2019t have a bank account and hasn\u2019t yet raised money.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen former convicted people come out of prison and run for Congress again, but never saw someone set up a committee while in prison.\u201d\n\nSecond Chance PAC uses the address of a post office box in Great Neck, New York, which is also the address used by a municipal credit analysis company called Savader Asset Advisors, LLC.\n\nPerry Leardi, the company\u2019s representative of sales, confirmed the company\u2019s chief executive officer, Mitchell Savader, is Adam Savader\u2019s father. But Leardi said he knew nothing about Adam Savader\u2019s super PAC.\n\nMitchell Savader did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n(Update, 8:05 p.m. Tuesday, June 30, 2015: Mitchell Savader explained by phone Tuesday evening that he helped his son set up the super PAC.\n\n\n\n\u201cMy son has a deep belief that people who have done something wrong\u201d should have \u201ca true second chance,\u201d Mitchell Savader said.\n\n\n\nHe said the point of the super PAC is to help influence legislation that would support people who have spent time in prison and are trying to start over.\n\n\n\nThe paperwork was filed just to establish the group and allow it to secure its name and email address, Mitchell Savader said. He said the group won\u2019t engage in fundraising until after his son is released.\n\n\n\nAt that point, he said, his son plans to finish college and will work on the super PAC as a side project.)\n\n\n\nThe super PAC\u2019s paperwork arrived at the Federal Election Commission in an envelope return addressed to Adam Savader at \u201cFederal Correctional Institution\u201d in New Jersey.\n\nThe Bureau of Prison\u2019s inmate search lists Adam Savader as an inmate in Fort Dix Federal Correctional Institute, a low-security prison in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cWe have people who set up super PACs going to prison over it, but this guy is getting out in front of it,\u201d said Kenneth Gross, the head of the political law practice at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom.\n\nIt isn\u2019t clear whether prison rules specifically address inmates forming political committees, and the Bureau of Prisons did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nForming a super PAC isn\u2019t inherently difficult. Fill out and submit several pages of paperwork, mail them to the FEC, and you\u2019re on your way.\n\nOperating a successful super PAC is another matter: Only a small fraction of the roughly 1,000 federally registered super PACs that exist today have raised significant amounts of money, and many haven\u2019t raised any money at all.\n\nSavader doesn\u2019t indicate in his super PAC paperwork which candidates or causes the committee intends to support. The FEC doesn\u2019t require such detail, either.\n\nMichael Soshnick, Savader\u2019s defense attorney at the time of his conviction, could not immediately be reached for comment by the Center for Public Integrity.\n\nThe judge overseeing the case acknowledged Savader had mental health issues, but that they weren\u2019t excuses for his crimes.\n\nAccording to a Politico story about Savader\u2019s sentencing, the judge agreed that working on Gingrich\u2019s campaign was his \u201cbreaking point.\u201d\n\nSavader\u2019s scheduled release date is July 27, 2016\u2014the week after Republicans are slated to formally nominate a presidential candidate.\n\nThis story is from the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

{"entityId": 1891, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The North has the money and the culture, but the South has defined the limits of our politics. That may finally and blessedly be ending.\n\nLet\u2019s not get carried away here, friends told me yesterday. A flag is just a symbol. When they stop passing voter-ID laws or start passing gun laws, then I\u2019ll be impressed.\n\nThis is a sound view, no doubt about that. But if you don\u2019t think symbols matter, think about how tenaciously people fight to hold on to them. And more than that: In terms of our political culture, the pending removal of the Confederate battle flag from South Carolina\u2019s capitol grounds, and now Mississippi\u2019s state flag\u2014and, don\u2019t forget, from WalMart\u2019s shelves\u2014represents a rare win for North over South since Reconstruction.\n\nThis is a history and set of facts that far too few Americans know, and it\u2019s vitally important to understand it in order to grasp the full magnitude of this moment. The South, more than the North, has dominated and defined the limits of America\u2019s political culture for most of the last 140-ish years. The North has the money, the North has Wall Street, and the North runs (most of) our high and popular culture. But the South has run our politics. And this moment that we\u2019re witness to now could be the blessed beginning of the end of all that.\n\nIt all started during Reconstruction, when a debate ensued about how the Civil War would be remembered. Our guide through these waters is Yale historian David Blight, whose groundbreaking book Race and Reunion tells this story. He shows masterfully how collectively historical memory is constructed.\n\nAccording to Blight, there were three competing interpretations of the war. The \u201cemancipationist\u201d one emphasized slavery as the cause of the war and the slaves\u2019 freedom as its great moral accomplishment. The \u201creconciliationist\u201d view emphasized the common hardships endured by soldiers and citizens who were after all countrymen. There was also a white supremacist version that marginalized the role of slavery as a cause of the conflict (sound familiar?), but the main interpretive battle was between the first two.\n\nIt\u2019s a long a complex and quite revolting story about this country we love, and you should read the book. But the gist of it is that in the interest of national reconciliation, the North\u2014where, let\u2019s face it, there was also no shortage of racists in the late 1800s\u2014capitulated to a view of the war with which the South could be comfortable, as a battle that fully and finally unified a country that never really had been.\n\nGettysburg became organized basically around Pickett\u2019s Charge, the last thrust of the Lost Cause. By the time of Woodrow Wilson\u2014the first Southern-born president since Andrew Johnson had taken over from the slain Lincoln, and a militant segregationist\u2014there was a 50-year commemoration of that battle attended by 50,000 veterans, not one of them black.\n\nAs for the Senate, all you need to know is this sentence, penned by the journalist William S. White in 1957: \u201cThe Senate might be described without too much violence to fact as the South\u2019s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, historical memory was morphing into political reality. In Congress, the United States entered the era of the Southern committee barons whose influence on the making of national policy was obscenely out of proportion to either their numbers or the extent to which their views, particularly on race, reflected broader American sentiment. Accruing seniority and working the rules, Southerners (and yes, conservatives, they were all Democrats then; so what?) gained power. By Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s time, of the House\u2019s 10 most important committees, Southerners chaired nine. As for the Senate, all you need to know is this sentence, penned by the journalist William S. White in 1957: \u201cThe Senate might be described without too much violence to fact as the South\u2019s unending revenge upon the North for Gettysburg.\u201d\n\nThe Southerners used that power to one end far above all others: keep black people down. But then, starting in 1958, the Senate began to elect some liberals; and outside the halls of power, which is where change actually happens, a certain young charismatic minister was changing white minds and opening white hearts across the country, even a few in the South.\n\nNext came the only years, roughly 1964 to sometime in the mid-1970s, depending on how you measure it, that the North vanquished the South politically since the Civil War. Many chairmanships changed hands; the racists were defeated and changed political parties; accommodation of the South was no longer something most Northerners and Westerners were interested in.\n\nSo that was all good, but that of course doesn\u2019t end our story. The South, through the person of Californian Ronald Reagan, who gave a high-profile speech invoking \u201cstates\u2019 rights\u201d in the very town where erstwhile states\u2019 righters had murdered Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney in 1964, came roaring back. The Christian Coalition became a force. From 1980 until 2008, the Democrats did manage to win two presidential elections, but only because they put forward an all-Southern ticket that talked more about \u201cfamily values\u201d than most Democrats would have really preferred, even if they did understand the political reality.\n\nJust as Blight observed a post-Civil War era that saw two world views, one fundamentally progressive and the other fundamentally reactionary, competing to interpret the past and thereby define the future, I argue that we\u2019ve been living through something very similar since 1980. And just like the emancipationists and reconciliationists, we\u2019re stuck in the \u201960s: They were quarreling about the 1860s, we about the 1960s. And in our political culture for most of the past 35 years, the modern-day version of the reconciliationists has won.\n\nBut now that\u2019s changing. Fortunately, the emancipationists control the culture from New York and Hollywood, and they\u2019ve pushed back on the Southerners hard\u2014this too is a huge change from the old days, when for example television networks were extremely careful not to offend Southern tastes. And so even the Southern Baptist Convention has quieted down about same-sex marriage, even if the Republican candidates haven\u2019t.\n\nBut this\u2014this flag business is the first instance I can recall of conservative Republican Southern politicians defying their right-wing base on an issue of first-order emotional importance. It\u2019s important that this isn\u2019t some liberal federal judge ordering the flag removed. It\u2019s Republican politicians doing it. I\u2019m not saying that to pat them on the back\u2014they\u2019re at least a decade late to be getting anything resembling credit as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m just observing it as telling: When future David Blights write about how the South started losing its hold on America\u2019s political culture in 2015, they\u2019ll write about this moment, the first time their leaders said to them, \u201cYour position is just too morally undignified for me to defend anymore.\u201d\n\nFor his part, the actual living David Blight isn\u2019t as hopeful about this as I am. In response to my question, he emailed me yesterday: \u201cThis may indeed be a rare moment. But if my work shows anything it might be simply to say beware when right-wing manipulators of historical memory offer reconciliation. They are looking for cover for other and perhaps larger matters.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s correct, of course. This massacre is still about guns and terrorism, and it\u2019s about South Carolina\u2019s voter-ID laws too, on which Clementa Pinckney was one of just two favorable votes in the state Senate. All those fights will continue, with the usual achingly slow progress (if progress at all on guns).\n\nBut this is still a big deal. It could usher in a second era of conquest over Southern political hegemony. If that happens, those other fights will be easier to win, eventually, too.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:12.859+0000"}

His Twitter has been silent since May 1, he hasn\u2019t posted to Facebook since the middle of March, and his once-popular Instagram account, boasting nearly 17,000 followers, was abruptly switched to private around the same time.\n\nIt\u2019s been a dramatic turn for the 34-year-old Illinois Republican, whose visage (and physique) not so long ago graced television screens and the covers of fitness magazines, once lauded for his ability to speak to the Millennial generation through harnessing social media.\n\nNo doubt much of the attention Schock received from prying cameras owed to his youth (elected at 27, he was the youngest member of the House) and good looks. But Schock\u2019s unusually high public visibility was something he had himself carefully crafted. His life on Capitol Hill had become a movie, with Schock in the starring role. Along the way, Schock recruited a supporting cast of aides and fellow congressmen. He spent lavishly on sets (office furniture and d\u00e9cor) and exotic scenery (overseas trips). And to record and broadcast the production, he retained a loyal crew of photographers.\n\nOne such shutterbug to come under government scrutiny is the Dallas-based wedding photographer Jonathon Link, whom Schock brought onto his congressional payroll last September with a salary amounting to $70,000 annually (in addition to about $900 per month from a campaign account). Having a personal photographer on staff is highly unusual, if not unprecedented, in the annals of congressional history.\n\n\u201cThe only federal elected official who I know who has a photographer is the President.\u201d \u2014 Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute.\n\n\u201cWhile I have seen members of Congress use staff to take pictures and video for their website and newsletters, I've never seen one use a precious staff slot on someone who did ONLY those functions,\u201d Mark Harkins, a senior fellow at Georgetown University\u2019s Government Affairs Institute and a 17-year Capitol Hill veteran, wrote in an email. \u201cThe only federal elected official who I know who has a photographer is the President.\u201d\n\nHowever ethically dubious, hiring a professional photographer with taxpayer funds is not illegal. But Schock\u2019s paying Link with monies from both his congressional and campaign accounts meant that a blurring of the lines between official government work and electioneering was inevitable. There is at least one questionable expense related to Link, a payment last November 18 for $29,021.44 under the vague category of \u201cweb development hosting, email and related services.\u201d Link has been subpoenaed by federal investigators and did not respond to an email seeking comment, nor did Schock.\n\nLink traveled to India with Schock in August of 2014, after which he produced the video below, in which Schock appears to be campaigning for president of the United States, if not United Nations Secretary General. Link\u2019s travel with Schock may have violated House rules, since his expenses were paid for by a private organization and Link did not join the congressman\u2019s staff until the following month (House rules only allow private groups to fund a companion\u2019s travel expenses if that guest is a staff member, spouse or child.) Members may seek a waiver from the Ethics Committee, but as first reported by National Journal, Schock never reported Link\u2019s travel.\n\nSo good of a photographer was Link that Schock was willing to loan him out to at least one fellow Republican, former congressman Bobby Schilling, who ran last year to regain his old seat in a district adjoining Schock\u2019s.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with Schilling\u2019s campaign, Link shot and edited this campaign advertisement. Schock ought to have listed the use of Link\u2019s services as an in-kind contribution, yet there is no record of his having done so. Schilling did not respond to a Daily Beast inquiry.\n\n\n\nOver the course of his congressional career, according to Federal Election Commission filings, Schock spent nearly $40,000 of campaign money on photography-related expenses, employing over a dozen different photographers. This is a fair amount for a congressman in one of the safest Republican seats in the country, who, thanks to his never having to worry about re-election, could emerge as one of the top elected GOP fundraisers for fellow Republican officials.\n\nA perusal of his congressional disbursements indicates that Schock may have spent over $20,000 in public money for a series of very pricy photo-ops with former First Lady Laura Bush. On September 16, 2010, he spent $17,016 from his congressional account on an outfit called Tall City State and Cinema. Three days earlier, Schock had held a fundraiser with Bush at the home of Doug Oberhelman, the CEO of Caterpillar, who attended last year\u2019s State of the Union address as Schock\u2019s guest. Earlier the same day, Schock held an event with Bush to celebrate his \u201cSummer Reading Program\u201d for local schoolchildren; disbursement records show that he paid $4,700 to a video production company called Shatterglass Studios to film it. According to Brett Hays, co-owner of Shatterglass, the company shot raw footage of the event and gave it to Schock.\n\nCrucial to any successful movie or television show are costumes and scenery, and here, Schock spared no expense. In 2011, he hired Jeanie Etchart, who as a staffer on the 2008 John McCain presidential campaign racked up $14,000 worth of clothing purchases for Vice Presidential nominee Sarah Palin. Having frequented stores such as Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue, and Nordstrom on behalf of the former Alaska governor, she certainly possessed the sartorial skills valued by the fashion-conscious congressman. Previous stories have reported Schock\u2019s spending tens of thousands of dollars on office furniture; The Daily Beast found that, in 2010 and 2012, he spent a combined $7,470.44 on a single company\u2014Junction Gallery of Peoria\u2014for picture framing.\n\nRegardless of its potential illegality, maintaining and disseminating Schock\u2019s public image was an expensive and time-consuming endeavor. (A replica of a lectern replete with a faux presidential seal, for instance, set the taxpayer back $5,000). Like most reality series, however, The Aaron Schock Show\u2019s ratings eventually took a nosedive. Unfortunately for the disgraced ex-congressman, what started out as The Amazing Race could end up as a bad episode of OZ.\n\n\u2014 Alexa Corse contributed to this report.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:13.166+0000"}

The first of many, apparently.\n\nThe first CMP video of a now year-old conversation among Daleiden, another CMP actor, and Planned Parenthood official Deborah Nucatola was edited to suggest that Planned Parenthood sells fetal body parts for profit, though the full footage revealed that Nucatola was actually discussing the legal practice of fetal-tissue donation and its associated processing costs.\n\nThis new video makes a similar claim. Allegedly filmed in February of this year, it shows CMP actors\u2014including Daleiden\u2014posing as a tissue-procurement company executive in a meeting with Mary Gatter, a Planned Parenthood medical director, at a restaurant. The video has been edited down to a roughly eight-minute runtime and full footage of the conversation had not been released as of 9:30 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nAlthough mentions of dollar amounts in the conversation may sound alarming\u2014as they were in the first video\u2014small payments for transportation and processing are legal in human fetal-tissue donation. Under 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 289g\u20142 , U.S. law prohibits the \u201cvaluable consideration\u201d of human fetal tissue, but it does allow \u201creasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue.\u201d\n\nIn the video, one of the CMP buyers asks for a figure, Gatter suggests $75 per specimen, and then the fake buyer tries to goad her on, saying \u201cthat\u2019s way too low.\u201d The video has been edited to highlight specific comments of Gatter\u2019s that make the conversation seem like a negotiation over profits\u2014comments like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you tell me what you\u2019re used to paying?\u201d\n\nThis time around, however, the CMP has also included statements by Gatter that debunk the idea that Planned Parenthood affiliates profit from the practice.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not in it for the money,\u201d Gatter makes it clear to the CMP actors at one point.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be in the position of being accused of selling tissue and stuff like that,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the other hand, there are costs associated with the use of our space, and all that kind of stuff.\u201d\n\nThe CMP actors twice offer $100 per specimen but we never see Gatter commit to accepting that amount, only to \u201cfind[ing] out what other affiliates in California are getting.\u201d She emphasizes to who she thought were biotech buyers that their \u201cvolume is so low,\u201d referring to the fact that second-trimester abortions are relatively rare.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been years since I talked about compensation,\u201d she says at one point. \u201cSo let me just figure out what others are getting and if this is in the ballpark, then it\u2019s fine.\u201d\n\nIn what is sure to become the most-quoted line from the video, Gatter jokes that she \u201cwant[s] a Lamborghini,\u201d but she immediately says, \u201cNo,\u201d and laughs, apparently at the idea of making money off the practice.\n\nThe video also includes some conversations surrounding abortion methods that preserve fetal tissue compared with techniques that tend not to leave tissue intact\u2014an ethical issue that raises questions about practices of informed consent from the patient.\n\nGatter notes at one point that if they switch methods from a suction method to one with less suction in order to \u201cincrease the odds that it would come out as an intact specimen\u201d then it violates \u201cthe protocol that says to the patient, \u2018We\u2019re not doing anything different in our care of you.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the video, Gatter makes no promises to change abortion techniques to preserve fetal tissue but does appear to raise the possibility of having a discussion with a Planned Parenthood surgeon about that \u201cargument\u201d and their abortion techniques.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re both totally appropriate techniques, there\u2019s no difference in pain involved, I don\u2019t think the patients would care one iota,\u201d she says.\n\nGatter only says that she will \u201csee how he feels,\u201d referring apparently to the surgeon\u2019s opinion on the difference in techniques.\n\nOnce again, the footage has been edited and full video has not been released, so, as of this writing, there is no way to decipher the complete context of this conversation surrounding abortion methods. Some sections of the video display time stamps, others do not, and the perspective regularly shifts between two cameras worn by the fake CMP buyers.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast, Eric Ferrero, vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said:\n\n\u201cThis morning, another very heavily edited video was released without the original footage for verification by activists who have been widely discredited and who edited a video last week to twist its meaning completely and support false claims. At this time, Planned Parenthood cannot confirm the authenticity of this tape, and nobody can tell exactly what was discussed because of the extremely heavy editing and the agenda of the activists who produced it. What we see on this tape is a woman who says \u2018We\u2019re not in it for the money,\u2019 and that any money is reimbursement for costs.\u201d\n\nPlanned Parenthood anticipated the release of today\u2019s video, noting in a detailed letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee dated Monday (PDF) that Daleiden and the CMP have likely filmed several interactions in which they offered money to Planned Parenthood affiliates for fetal tissue.\n\nIn some cases, they believe that the CMP may have offered an \u201castronomical amount compared to the minimal cost-recovery fees that affiliates with tissue-donation programs currently recoup.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of these efforts were rebuffed,\u201d the letter maintains.\n\nPPFA\u2019s letter was written in response to the committee\u2019s announced investigation of the first video, undertaken at the urging of House Speaker John Boehner, who called the video \u201chorrific.\u201d Several GOP presidential candidates have criticized the video and seven states have announced investigations into their own Planned Parenthood affiliates.\n\nEarly Tuesday morning, top Republican lawmakers and presidential candidates had yet to respond to the second video.\n\nAt this point\u2014and given the tradition of Planned Parenthood sting operations in which CMP is involved\u2014the videos seem more calculated to produce a strong reaction than to provide immediately verifiable proof of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nLast week, for example, a Roll Call interview with Congressmen Tim Murphy (R-PA) and Trent Franks (R-AZ), suggested that some in the GOP leadership may have known about the first CMP sting video weeks in advance of its release and did not take any action at that time.\n\nWhen Roll Call asked why Murphy waited until after the video\u2019s release to make a public statement, he ended the interview and said, \u201cThis interview didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nIn an O\u2019Reilly Factor interview last week, Daleiden also stumbled when asked if he had provided any information from his investigation to the authorities.\n\n\u201cAre you saying they are doing something illegal?\u201d O\u2019Reilly asked.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Daleiden replied.\n\nBut when O\u2019Reilly followed up by asking if he had \u201creported this to the authorities,\u201d Daleiden paused before saying: \u201cBringing our information in front of law enforcement was always a goal that CMP had from the beginning of this project and as we can see in the news out of Texas and Louisiana\u2026 the entire state governments of both of those states are taking this very seriously\u2026\u201d\n\nWhile these federal and state investigations are underway, it is likely that even more videos will be released. In the letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, PPFA legal counsel claimed that Daleiden could have \u201cthousands of hours of videotape\u201d from years of corporate espionage. During this time, Daleiden allegedly posed as a buyer from a fake biotech LLC called Biomax Procurement Services, which seems to be his cover for this second video as well.\n\nThe letter further claims that Daleiden has taped Planned Parenthood staff \u201con at least 65 occasions\u201d over the last eight years and that he used a fake California driver\u2019s license to gain access to Planned Parenthood facilities.\n\nThe videos appear to be part of a lengthy and expensive project that Daleiden, who is 26 and a relatively fresh face in the pro-life movement, could not have funded on his own.\n\nIndeed, since the release of the first video, new details have emerged about the other individuals associated with the CMP\u2019s undercover investigation\u2014associations that go beyond Daleiden\u2019s history with the anti-abortion group Live Action, which has also produced heavily edited sting videos in Planned Parenthood facilities.\n\nA 2013 registration form obtained by The Nation last week revealed the names of Daleiden\u2019s fellow board members at the CMP: Albin Rhomberg and Troy Newman.\n\nRhomberg has a long and strident history of anti-abortion activism\u2014one California Planned Parenthood worker says that he once followed her \u201cfor an entire city block, barely 3 feet away, filming and shouting at me about my evil work with Planned Parenthood\u201d\u2014but it is Newman\u2019s association with the CMP that has raised the most eyebrows.\n\nNewman is the president of Operation Rescue, a pro-life organization that became the center of national media attention when George Tiller, a Kansas physician who provided late-term abortions, was assassinated by anti-abortion activist Scott Roeder in 2009 during worship services at Tiller\u2019s church.\n\nAfter the murder, Newman, who had moved Operation Rescue headquarters to Kansas in 2002 in order to be closer to Tiller\u2019s practice, released a statement distancing the organization from Roeder, claiming that he \u201chas never been a member, contributor, or volunteer with Operation Rescue.\u201d\n\nWhen Roeder was arrested, however, police found the phone number of Operation Rescue senior policy adviser Cheryl Sullenger on the dashboard of his car. Sullenger, who had spent two years in federal prison from 1988 to 1990 after pleading guilty to plotting the bombing of a San Diego abortion provider, admitted that she had been in contact with Roeder in the past and had provided information to him about Tiller\u2019s whereabouts, information unrelated to the eventual shooting.\n\nIn a 2009 phone interview from prison, Roeder, who was convicted of first-degree murder, told The Wichita Eagle that he felt \u201crelief and joy\u201d about Tiller\u2019s death and maintained that he was, in fact, associated with Operation Rescue. He claimed to have \u201cprobably a thousand dollars worth of receipts, at least, from the money I\u2019ve donated to [Newman].\u201d\n\nAt that point, Newman told the paper that he could not \u201cfind [Roeder] in the database\u201d but left the possibility open that he could have donated to Operation Rescue.\n\n\u201cIf he did, we have probably over the past 10 years over 50,000 people who have contributed to us,\u201d he said.\n\nFurther connections between Operation Rescue and the CMP investigation have emerged in conjunction with this latest video. In Operation Rescue\u2019s announcement of the second video, the logo for the CMP\u2019s Human Capital Project includes the phrase \u201cIn consultation with Operation Rescue.\u201d The logo on the CMP website does not mention this relationship.\n\nThe announcement was written by Sullenger, who still serves as Operation Rescue\u2019s senior policy adviser. Her bio with the group says that she \u201cnow regrets\u201d her actions and \u201chas openly denounced violence as a means to stop abortion.\u201d\n\nIn a three-word response to The Daily Beast\u2019s request for comment, Newman said that Operation Rescue provides \u201cadvice, consulting, funds\u201d to the CMP.\n\n\n\nIn his statement to The Daily Beast, PPFA spokesman Eric Ferrero explicitly referenced CMP\u2019s relationship to other anti-abortion activists: \u201cIt\u2019s important to know that the source of these videos is a group of extremists who have intimidated women and doctors for years in their agenda to ban abortion completely.\u201d\n\nIf the Planned Parenthood legal counsel has anticipated the CMP\u2019s moves correctly, we can expect more videos to come. According to the PPFA\u2019s letter to the House Energy and Commerce Committee, these videos could purport to show physicians discussing how abortions might be adjusted \u201cif the patient has requested to donate tissue\u201d and reveal \u201ca highly sensitive area\u201d in a clinic where tissues are processed after abortion procedures.\n\nAnother possible video may show a Biomax representative asking \u201cquestions about the racial characteristics of tissue donated to researchers studying sickle-cell anemia,\u201d with responses that could be edited to corroborate some pro-life groups\u2019 attempts to depict abortion as a form of racial genocide.\n\nBut given the sheer amount of film that the CMP may have in store, there\u2019s no telling how many videos they will release. (The CMP did not respond to a request for comment.) Last week, Daleiden told The Washington Post that he would release videos weekly for the next few months.\n\nIt\u2019s going to be a long summer for Planned Parenthood.\n\n\n\nUpdate 7/21/15 12:10 PM: The CMP has now released what it claims to be \u201cfull footage\u201d of the conversation from which this morning\u2019s video was taken.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:13.359+0000"}
{"entityId": 1894, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As Donald Trump courts controversy on the campaign trail, his hair remains mesmerizing, defying both taste and gravity. Who\u2019s responsible, and what can be done?\n\nOn Wednesday, as Donald Trump insulted a female reporter during a live television interview with MSNBC, it was business as usual for the presidential hopeful who has seemingly offended everyone from NBC to Mexico to the FAA.\n\nBut to a more suspecting eye, something was different.\n\nSure, his arrogant, belittling, and aggressive personality was on point, but the subtle glow that typically surrounds his head was askew.\n\nThe once marmalade-colored locks of his one-of-a-kind hairstyle had become a muddled mess of silver and faded blond.\n\nThe Trump hair really is something: it\u2019s orange and matted-looking on the sides, and now white/silver, wispy, swept back, defying the laws of physics and practicality, on top.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like he woke up and said, \u2018You know what? Fuck my hair,\u2019\u201d said celebrity groomer Adrian Fanus, whose clients include Forest Whittaker.\n\nFanus told The Daily Beast, \u201cIf you saw someone walking down the street with their hands cuffed to a briefcase, you\u2019d think, \u2018There\u2019s something in there he doesn\u2019t want me to see.\u2019 I feel the same way about the way Donald Trump combs his hair over on top. What is it concealing?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy agent got in touch with Trump\u2019s office around 1997 to put me forward as someone who could cut or restyle his hair,\u201d Losi, the celebrity men\u2019s hairdresser for New York salon Martial Vivot, told The Daily Beast as she was en route to Toronto to style Jake Gyllenhaal\u2019s locks for the premiere of his new movie, Southpaw.\n\nLosi has also styled the likes of Hugh Jackman, Tom Hanks, Liam Neeson, Zachary Quinto, and Steve Buscemi.\n\n\u201cWe were told, \u2018His hair is the way it is,\u2019\u201d Losi said of the firm word from Trump\u2019s office. \u201cHe gives strong direction about how it should be, and he\u2019s not very interested in changing it. Apparently, he does his own. He starts from the back. He combs it forward, so it reaches down past his nose, and then he folds it back, and then he sprays it.\u201d\n\nLosi, on the other hand, would have tried \u201cto brush some of it to the side,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut it too short. He\u2019s a big guy with a fat face. Cut it too short and he\u2019d end up with jowls.\u201d\n\nAs for the color, she doubts it\u2019s natural.\n\n\u201cHe is probably like one of my clients who dyes his hair once every four months, leaving it until the roots really start coming through,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would also have to blow-dry that kind of hair: the nature of white hair is that it cannot be contained.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, when he spoke to the Friends of Abe, the ginger flank of Trump hair was plastered firm down at the sides, and a side parting had emerged. The back was long, straggly, and running free.\n\nTrump\u2019s hairdo, or hairdon\u2019t, has been a meme-worthy fixation of pop culture for years.\n\nExperts have debated its naturalness. Comedian Seth Myers used it as the butt of his jokes at the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011. And, most recently, the iconic Homer Simpson was sucked into the golden abyss of its \u201cgravity-defying comb-over.\u201d\n\n\u201cApparently, he does his own. He starts from the back. He combs it forward, so it reaches down past his nose, and then he folds it back.\u201d\n\nAnd as Fanus, observing recent pictures of the Donald, said, \u201cIt\u2019s also all the color going on. The hair colors and his red face are all clashing.\u201d\n\nWhich stylist is responsible for the world\u2019s most notorious male haircut? Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s spokesperson, did not return The Daily Beast\u2019s enquiries for the name of the Trump barber.\n\nSo, how did it happen? Where is it coming from? And exactly what is hiding under that \u201cit\u2019s not a comb-over\u201d comb-forward? Could it lead our nation? And is it responsible for chemtrails?\n\n\u201cPeople always comment on it,\u201d Trump told Nigel Farndale of Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. \u201cBut it\u2019s not that bad, and it is mine\u2014look,\u201d Trump added, reportedly tugging at the front to show this was no wig or toup\u00e9e.\n\n\u201cI mean, I get killed on it. I had an article where someone said it was a hairpiece, but you can see it isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFarndale assents that this is true, then asked whether Trump used gel. \u201cNo, I use spray, actually. I\u2019ll comb it wet, then spray it so it doesn\u2019t get blown away by the wind.\u201d\n\nAccording to a 2011 interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Trump confessed that his daily routine consists of one part Head and Shoulders and one part air dry (approximately 60 minutes).\n\n\u201cYes I do use a comb,\u201d he told Erik Hedegaard. \u201cDo I comb it forward? No, I don\u2019t comb it forward\u2026I actually don\u2019t have a bad hairline. When you think about it, it\u2019s not bad. I mean, I get a lot of credit for comb-overs. But it\u2019s not really a comb-over. It\u2019s sort of a little bit forward and back. I\u2019ve combed it the same way for years. Same thing, every time.\u201d\n\nDetermined to find out more about this evolution and how his infamous hairstyle came to be, and who keeps it buoyant, unapologetic, and camera-ready on the campaign trail, we sought answers from those close to Trump.\n\nWe reached Sharon Sinclair, Trump\u2019s key hairstylist and makeup artist on The Apprentice, but\u2014after agreeing to speak\u2014we were unable to get her on the phone. All communication with her quickly went radio silent.\n\nHair salons close to the Trump Empire refused to comment, or point us in the direction of those who might help.\n\nAnthony Cristiano, of his namesake salon in Chicago\u2019s Trump Tower, declined due to the nature of their close business relationships.\n\nIt seemed that there was a Trump hair omerta in operation. The Donald\u2019s follicles inspired fear. No one would speak of the origins and inspiration behind that marmalade and silver color combo, that defiant, wispy undo\u2026\n\nEven current and previous presidential hairstylists were hesitant to comment.\n\nZahira Zahir, who groomed George W. Bush\u2019s locks, quickly hung up.\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s stylist, Cristophe Shatteman, never returned our calls.\n\nAnd Zariff, who is the current \u201cfirst barber,\u201d declined to comment out of fear that many could misconstrue his remarks.\n\nThere were a few who were bold enough to speak\u2014and these brave souls even attempted to persuade the real estate tycoon to switch to a more updated look, as the forward-sweeping nature of his current style is generally suited for a much younger demographic. (Or, as Fanus put it, \u201cTrump looks like an 18-year-old skateboarding kid with a bad tan.\u201d)\n\nWhile Trump has sported the same \u2019do for decades, many of his peers have adapted their styles to their advancing age, opting for much more mature looks.\n\nOver the years, the color of Trump\u2019s hair has visibly had its ups and downs. It has gone from a dark strawberry blond to a very bright ginger with a subtle touch-of-gray to white to his now platinum mix of blond and gray.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d darken the roots,\u201d said Fanus. \u201cJohn Boehner has got it right. He has black hair, a touch of gray. He is wearing his age and maturity well. I would darken Trump\u2019s hair, and his brows. A lot of how bad he looks is accentuated by what looks like bad tanning.\u201d (Or is it makeup, or both? More mysteries.)\n\n\u201cHe needs to lay off the tanning,\u201d said Fanus. The solution to Trump\u2019s hair woes, as well as some darker brown coloring, Fanus thought, would be to cut the sides, shorten the front bangs, add some layering and\u2014as Losi suggested\u2014comb to the side, rather than its current, mesmerizing forward and back swoosh.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s got so much money why should he care what anyone thinks?\u201d Losi said, laughing. \u201cImagine saying to him as a hairdresser, \u2018Mr. Trump, why don\u2019t we try this?\u2019 Silence. Then he says, \u2018You\u2019re fired.\u2019\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:13.540+0000"}
{"entityId": 1895, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The former Arkansas governor is open to sending the National Guard to stop women from getting abortions. No, really\u2014that\u2019s his plan.\n\nThey spent a decade dodging bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan. They came home to preserve the peace during riots and floods. Tomorrow, they\u2019ll pick up their machine guns and body armor, put on their camo, and stop women from getting abortions.\n\nThat\u2019s the vision Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, has, at least, for deploying the National Guard.\n\nNo, seriously.\n\nA sub-contest is emerging in the most conservative corners of the Republican primary, as candidates vie to present themselves as the contenders who oppose abortion in the most cases and with the most government involvement possible.\n\nHuckabee has managed to get to everyone\u2019s right on the issue, suggesting he\u2019s open to ideas that could make the government\u2019s efforts to block abortion more intrusive than ever.\n\nLast month, the governor told a reporter that he was open to the possibility of using the National Guard or FBI to keep women from having abortions.\n\nUsing the military to stop abortion would be, uh, historic.\n\n\u201cI will not pretend there is nothing we can do to stop this,\u201d he said on the campaign trail in Iowa, the Huffington Post reported.\n\nWhen asked if he would use those federal resources to stop abortions, Huckabee replied , \u201cWe\u2019ll see when I\u2019m president,\u201d adding, \u201cAll American citizens should be protected.\u201d\n\nThe National Guard is typically brought in by governors to help out with national disasters (think Hurricane Katrina or Sandy) or to maintain order during a riot (think last spring\u2019s unrest in Baltimore). Once in a great, great while, the troops might be brought in to enforce the law of the land, when local enforcement can\u2019t or won\u2019t, like in the early days of the civil rights movement in the South.\n\nBut, of course, abortion is legal in this country. Which means the idea of sending in the troops to stop the practice is doubly odd. Especially because, as a former governor, Huckabee knows all about deploying the National Guard. (In fact, Huckabee considered himself enough of an authority of the Guard that last year he attacked Missouri Governor Jay Nixon for supposedly mis-deploying those troops during the unrest in Ferguson. \u201c His use of the National Guard was disgusting and deplorable ,\u201d Huckabee said.)\n\nOf course, Huckabee has made several forays into the unusual on reproductive rights. At the Fox News debate last week, he made a controversial legal justification for his opposition to abortion, arguing that the Fifth and 14th Amendments mean abortion should be illegal.\n\n\u201cAnd this notion that we just continue to ignore the personhood of the individual is a violation of that unborn child\u2019s Fifth and 14th Amendment rights for due process and equal protection under the law,\u201d he said.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s campaign didn\u2019t clarify how this would be enforced but reiterated the candidate\u2019s prolife beliefs in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe can debate issues like taxes, foreign policy and education but the undebatable science is settled on one thing: unborn babies are human beings. The right to life is a constitutionally protected right, and as President, Governor Huckabee will uphold the Constitution and use the powers of the presidency to defend the unborn,\u201d said Hogan Gidley, Huckabee\u2019s senior communications adviser. \u201cThe Governor has been clear that you can\u2019t criticize foreign countries for genocide if our government willingly accepts, endorses, and subsidizes infanticide.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s a stance that makes it hard for anyone to get to his right.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll see when I\u2019m president...all American citizens should be protected,\u201d former Governor Mike Huckabee said.\n\n\n\nAt National Review , Michael New noted that the 14th Amendment strategy has been largely disregarded by the pro-life movement. Instead, activists focus on eliminating federal funding for Planned Parenthood and backing presidential candidates who promise their judicial nominees will oppose Roe v. Wade.\n\nAnd at the state level, activists push\u2014often with great success\u2014for laws tightening regulations on abortion clinics and barring the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nSo Huckabee\u2019s invocation of the 14th Amendment argument puts him outside the norm, even among the country\u2019s most influential pro-life advocates.\n\nBeyond the fact that Huckabee\u2019s strategy would potentially upend the Constitution, it would also break new ground\u2014new and very big-government ground\u2014in law enforcement.\n\nLeslie Reagan, professor of history, medicine, gender and women\u2019s studies, and law at the University of Illinois College of Law, said Huckabee deserves credit for his forthrightness.\n\n\u201cHe was very straightforward about what it actually means to say you want to restrict abortion,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd what it means is forcing women to bear children, to carry out every pregnancy. That\u2019s much more direct than what people tend to say.\u201d\n\nReagan has done extensive work studying the history of abortion in the United States, and said\u2014contrary to Huckabee\u2019s insinuation\u2014enforcement of the abortion bans that existed before Roe v. Wade was solely a concern of local law enforcement. Law enforcers executed bans by going after providers. And they would often find providers who performed the procedure illegally when women with medical complications from the procedure went to hospitals for further medical attention.\n\nSometimes women who hadn\u2019t had abortions\u2014including women who had miscarried\u2014also faced interrogations.\n\n\u201cPolice would be called in and ask them questions,\u201d Reagan said. \u201c\u2018Who did this to you, where was it done, how did they do it, who was your partner, who made you pregnant, who\u2019s the father?\u2019\u201d\n\nHospital staff and doctors also pressed women for information, Reagan continued. She added that police told some doctors that if they didn\u2019t question women in these situations, they would be considered suspects. These enforcement efforts\u2014particularly energetic in the 1940s and 1950s\u2014were always local concerns, and never federal ones.\n\nJohanna Schoen, a professor at Rutgers University who studies the history of the reproductive rights movement, told The Daily Beast that local politics sometimes dictated when clinics got raided.\n\n\u201cMany localities ignored abortion providers if they offered safe services,\u201d she emailed. \u201cLocal law enforcement did, however, occasionally set up sting operations, most frequently in times when elected officials wanted to demonstrate that they were hard on moral crimes\u2014such as when they were seeking re-election. And also in the case of providers who offered clearly substandard services.\u201d\n\nReagan said San Diego had its own abortion squad that prioritized enforcement of the state\u2019s abortion ban, and that many law enforcers tried to plan these raids to burst in while abortions were happening so they would be able to make stronger criminal cases.\n\nThat said, Huckabee\u2019s call for a role for federal law enforcement in the abortion wars isn\u2019t, in fact, 100 percent off base. But it\u2019s the polar opposite of what he suggested on the campaign trail; rather than pursuing abortion providers, federal agents have stepped in protect them.\n\n\u201cMany of the most prominent providers are in regular contact with the FBI and some have temporarily been under FBI protection,\u201d Schoen said.\n\n\u201cWhen the National Women\u2019s Health Association opened Jackson Women\u2019s Health, the one remaining abortion clinic in Jackson, Mississippi, the Justice Department sent federal marshals to protect patients and staff,\u201d she added. \u201cThis was just after the first killings of abortion providers.\u201d\n\nLynn Paltrow, who heads the group National Advocates for Pregnant Women, argues that enforcement of abortion bans would be very different now than it was in the first half of the 20th century. In her paper \u201cRoe v. Wade and the New Jane Crow: Reproductive Rights in the Age of Mass Incarceration,\u201d published in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health, she argued that abortion bans could result in a substantial increase in the number of women incarcerated.\n\n\u201cThis new era of mass incarceration\u2014which is largely accepted by the public, defended by an army of lobbyists, and justified by a war on drugs deeply rooted in America\u2019s history of slavery and racism\u2014makes it far more likely today than in 1973 that if Roe is overturned women will themselves be arrested and jailed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt is also likely that women having or considering having abortions will be subject to far more government surveillance than in the past.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s suggestion isn\u2019t just a big outlier among Republican presidential candidates that would potentially send the Constitution topsy-turvy; it\u2019s also a call for dramatically increasing the role of the federal policing power in local law enforcement efforts.

But none of those threats were of immediate concern to convention attendees.\n\nThere\u2019s just no reason to be afraid of anything in the presence of all those guns.\n\nAs NRA-ILA Executive Director Chris Cox would advise the thousands-strong audience during his opening remarks, the media in attendance at Friday\u2019s forum were on \u201cthe safest assignment in America today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I see that video of that Jordanian burned alive in a cage, when I see those Christians from Egypt and elsewhere that are beheaded, that\u2019s something you feel,\u201d said Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker.\n\nTo Cox\u2019s credit, the only shots fired throughout the four-hour-long forum were of the rhetorical variety, most often aimed squarely at the likes of Michael Bloomberg, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Utilized on several occasions by more than one forum headliner, a strategically placed hyphen between \u201cObama\u201d and \u201cClinton\u201d might as well have been a bull\u2019s-eye.\n\nAs I made my way toward the press office amid a congregation of predominantly white males of the Baby Boomer generation (and older), several of whom sported enviable beards and a few with superbly groomed handlebar mustaches, I happened to overhear a conversation between a pair of Music City Center concierges who were busily clearing tables and rearranging chairs.\n\n\u201cHave you been up to that exhibit hall yet?\u201d the elder staffer asked his young counterpart.\n\n\u201cNuh-uh.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaaan, they got everything up there\u2014all kinds of guns, knives, bows and arrows, crossbows, armor \u2026\u201d\n\nBut back to the speeches.\n\nBen Carson, world-renowned surgeon-turned-fringe candidate, had a different kind of speech. He opened his remarks by lamenting that some had gotten the wrong impression about his \u201centhusiasm\u201d for guns. He stressed that his position on guns had not evolved, but rather that he had learned to better express himself.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a youngster, I was always excited to see guns, and as I got a little older and approached the teen years, I saw a lot of guns. They weren\u2019t necessarily carried by people who were law-abiding citizens, either,\u201d Carson said in a soft-spoken tone that was in sharp contrast to the often booming voices of his fellow speakers. \u201cI remember seeing people lying on the ground with bullet holes, waiting to die. I remember both of my older cousins, who we lived with, were killed \u2026 There was a lot of carnage that I saw.\u201d\n\nThen, as a surgeon, Carson recalled spending many nights operating on gunshot victims.\n\n\u201cAnd all of that is horrible,\u201d Carson lamented, just before pivoting\u2014enthusiastically\u2014to a line much more worthy of the crowd\u2019s roaring approval. \u201cBut I can tell you something. It\u2019s not nearly as horrible as having a population that is defenseless against a group of tyrants who have arms, and that\u2019s what we have to always bear in mind in this nation.\u201d\n\nAnd then there was Senator Ted Cruz, who more than fulfilled his role as the convention\u2019s rhetorical Rambo.\n\nPutting out an already familiar call to his \u201cgrassroots army\u201d to \u201creignite the promise of America,\u201d Cruz continued to hone his stump speech, touching on everything from the 47 Republicans who signed the infamous letter to Iran (he wishes he would\u2019ve made his signature larger, like John Hancock, so the Ayatollah could read it with no need for reading glasses) to the first battle of the Texas Revolution (when Texans made the famed \u201cCome and Take It\u201d flag, daring Santa Anna to try to reclaim a cannon).\n\n\u201cThis weekend, Hillary Clinton is announcing for president,\u201d Cruz said to\u2026 not applause.\n\n\u201cWell, I tell ya, if Hillary Clinton is going to join with Barack Obama and the gun-grabbers and come after our guns, then what I say is, \u2018Come and take it,\u2019\u201d Cruz growled. \u201cIf they\u2019re going to come after the Constitution, what the American people, what we say together is, \u2018Come and take it.\u2019 \u2026 I am both humbled and proud to stand with you as together we bring back, we revive, that shiny city on the hill that is the United States of America.\u201d\n\nGuns, armies, Iran, revolution, the Alamo, and Reagan?

{"entityId": 1897, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As we've been reminded by the fight in Indiana, supporters of discrimination have always cloaked their views in appeals to personal liberty.\n\nOnce upon a time, a restaurant owner refused to serve people who were different. He said he did so in the name of freedom, not discrimination.\n\nThe time was 1964, the place was Georgia, and the man was Lester Maddox. He was the owner of The Pickrick restaurant and one July day he chased out three black patrons, waving a pistol. This made him something of a local celebrity and a national symbol of resistance to the big government imposition of civil rights. But he always insisted that he was not motivated by racism but simply defending the rights of private property and his personal beliefs.\n\n\u201cThis property belongs to me\u2014and I\u2019ll throw out a white one, a black one, a red-headed one or a bald headed one. It doesn\u2019t make any difference to me.\u201d\n\nMaddox became a hero to conservative populists\u2014most of whom were Democrats at that time in the South, because of a hangover from the Civil War a century before\u2014and he rode the wave of resistance to desegregation all the way to the Governor\u2019s mansion two years later.\n\n\u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat, but sometimes it rhymes,\u201d Mark Twain allegedly said. And there are no perfect parallels between Lester Maddox and the florists, bakers, and other small-business owners who have been invoked as a reason to protect the religious liberties of those who could legally refuse to serve gay and lesbian weddings. But amid a national debate about gay civil rights a half-century later, as we fitfully evolve toward the promise of a more perfect union, it is useful to listen for echoes of old arguments because they can clarify our current conversations.\n\nWe\u2019ve had an age-old argument in our nation between the powers of the federal government and states\u2019 rights. It goes back to the ratification of the Constitution (ironic, because many of the states\u2019 rights advocates since have presented themselves as the purest defenders of the Constitution) and found expression in the heated debates between John C. Calhoun and Daniel Webster, and Jefferson Davis and Abraham Lincoln, that ultimately exploded into civil war. The arguments resurfaced again in the 1960s over civil rights and desegregation. And so it goes.\n\nBut the de facto defenders of slavery and segregation rarely framed their arguments as endorsements of inequality. Instead, their argument was often uplifted, framed as a defense of lofty ideals. Sometimes these were rooted in theological objections\u2014defense of slavery and defense of segregation was at one point imbued with the hue of religious belief. But more often it was framed as a fight between individual liberty and government tyranny, with no irony intended.\n\nDefense of slavery and defense of segregation was at one point imbued with the hue of religious belief. But more often it was framed as a fight between individual liberty and government tyranny, with no irony intended.\n\nGeorge Wallace, the conservative populist Democratic governor of Alabama who heatedly defended segregation, was a case in point. He famously thundered in his inaugural address that \u201cIt is very appropriate that from this cradle of the Confederacy, this very heart of the great Anglo-Saxon Southland, that today we sound the drum for freedom as have our generations of forebears before us time and again down through history\u2026 In the name of the greatest people that have ever trod this earth, I draw the line in the dust and toss the gauntlet before the feet of tyranny, and I say segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.\u201d\n\nBut he also made more subtle arguments against civil rights, rooted in private property: \u201cThis civil rights bill will wind up putting a homeowner in jail because he doesn\u2019t sell his home to someone that some bureaucrat thinks he ought to sell it to.\u201d\n\nAnd yet he insisted, \u201cI never made a statement in my political life that reflects on a man\u2019s race\u2026 my only interest is in the restoration of local government.\u201d\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook grew up in George Wallace\u2019s Alabama and as he wrote this week in The Washington Post, \u201cI remember what it was like to grow up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s. Discrimination isn\u2019t something that\u2019s easy to oppose. It doesn\u2019t always stare you in the face. It moves in the shadows. And sometimes it shrouds itself within the very laws meant to protect us.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s this \u201cshroud\u201d line that\u2019s most relevant here. Even old Lester Maddox, looking back on his life in a 1975 memoir, reflected that \u201cI knew then, as I know now, that I was trying to protect not only the rights of Lester Maddox, but every citizen, including the three men I chased off the property.\u201d\n\nThis seductive self-justification doubles as self-deception. It\u2019s a trope that tied libertarians up in knots for decades, trying to mediate their own twin imperatives of property rights and individual liberty. But time has made those choices clearer, as conservatives celebrate the now self-evident moral clarity of Martin Luther King, who declared that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d when Maddox was elected governor. This was understandable, given that Maddox called desegregation \u201cungodly, un-Christian and un-American.\u201d\n\nMaddox, if he is remembered today, is perhaps best known as a refrain in the \u201970s-era satirical Randy Newman song \u201cRednecks,\u201d which proclaims, \u201cWell, he may be a fool, but he\u2019s our fool, and if you think that you\u2019re better than him you\u2019re wrong.\u201d The song goes on to jab at the hypocrisy of self-righteous Northern critics who denounce the South while ignoring the segregation that hides under their own noses in cities like New York, Chicago, and Boston. But as with all satire, the song contains a serious point that echoes on today: When conservative populism rears its head, liberals often make divisions worse by denying the respective humanity and individuality of the people with whom they disagree, compounding resentments that can turn into political backlash that endures for decades.\n\nWhat\u2019s sinister is the Orwellian mislabeling of the impulses behind resistance to civil rights progress that aims to ensure equal protection as a defense of liberty. And while it\u2019s become fashionable for conservatives to honor Martin Luther King and venerate past civil rights fights, it\u2019s nothing more than an attempt to benefit from historical amnesia unless they are willing to apply those lessons to present-day debates. That means respecting the core conservative value of individual freedom in reality rather than just rhetoric.\n\nIn the Ballad of Lester Maddox, the lyrics change but the melody remains the same. It echoes across the decades, age-old arguments where freedom to discriminate becomes the emotional litmus-test of liberty. Direct parallels may miss the point, but ignoring these echoes blinds us from the ability to see current events in light of history and to anticipate what arguments will look like generations from now.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:14.287+0000"}

{"entityId": 1899, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "A number of Republican candidates and office holders say they can sink the nuke deal with Iran. In reality, they probably can\u2019t.\n\nNo matter how what happens with the 2016 elections, the chances of the GOP blowing up the nuclear deal with Iran are extraordinarily slim.\n\nFirst off, it\u2019s not a treaty, so it doesn't need the approval of two-thirds of the Republican-controlled Senate. For a while this year, the Obama administration seemed to think they could cut Congress out of the process entirely, presumably using the executive waiver powers built into most of the relevant sanctions legislation; Obama initially threatened to veto Senator Bob Corker's bill to give Congress a vote on the deal.\n\nThe veto threat was withdrawn, and Corker's bill passed both houses of Congress with near-unanimous support (only the very hawkish Republican Tom Cotton voted no), because the process it establishes is heavily weighted toward approving the deal. If Congress does nothing (or if action gets bottled up in committee), the deal is approved by default. If a resolution of approval fails, it's a symbolic rebuke with no legal force. And if a resolution of disapproval passes, it needs veto-proof support to actually block U.S. participation in the deal.\n\nThat means the president would need to lose 13 Democrats in the Senate and 45 Democrats in the House (more if there are Republican defections in the other direction). That will, at the very least, be difficult.\n\nBefore the deal, some Democrats cited a letter put out by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, signed by a bipartisan group that includes five former Obama advisers, that laid out guidelines for an acceptable deal.\n\nThe deal that\u2019s been struck clearly doesn\u2019t meet that bar; to take just one example, the letter demands that weapons inspectors \"must have timely and effective access to any sites in Iran they need to visit in order to verify Iran\u2019s compliance with the agreement.\" The deal makes it possible for Iran to delay inspections for up to 24 days. Nonetheless, the White House is circulating an argument that the deal not only meets but exceeds the letter\u2019s benchmarks, and it\u2019s quite possible, even probable, that the requisite number of lawmakers will buy their assertions.\n\nAnd no matter what happens on Capitol Hill, the United Nations and the European Union will begin unwinding sanctions on Iran in short order; the UN will likely act even before Congress gets around to debating a disapproval resolution. And that makes things a lot trickier for the next president than some of the Republicans who want the job are letting on.\n\nCongress can pull the U.S. out of the deal; so can the next president. But at this point, Washington can do little to change the basic picture.\n\n\u201cAs President,\u201d Rick Perry said in a statement, \u201cone of my first official acts will be to fully rescind this accord\u201d\u2014which, under a straightforward interpretation of \u201cfully rescind,\u201d is not actually possible.\n\nScott Walker at least said in his official campaign announcement on Monday that \u201cwe need to terminate the bad deal with Iran on day one, put in place crippling economic sanctions and convince our allies to do the same,\u201d which at least includes a nod toward the fact that the sanctions are an international issue.\n\nBut with Iran open for business and European corporations eager to cash in, reviving the sanctions regime internationally almost certainly can\u2019t be done in year one, much less on day one. If it\u2019s possible at all, it would require a multi-year process of documenting Iranian violations of the deal to rebuild the consensus that has until now left Iran isolated. White House protestations to the contrary, the snapback provisions in the deal do little to change that.\n\nTo her credit, Carly Fiorina acknowledges this: \u201cEven if Congress does vote this deal down, the rest of the world has moved on,\u201d she notes. Fiorina advocates U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2019s financial sector; that would have some bite, but without international cooperation it wouldn\u2019t undo much of what Iran gets from the deal.\n\nOther candidates are less candid: Ted Cruz echoes Walker\u2019s \"day one\" phrasing, and Marco Rubio promises to \u201cre-impose sanctions\u201d but glosses over the limits on Washington\u2019s ability to do so unilaterally.\n\nCongress can pull the U.S. out of the deal; so can the next president. But at this point, Washington can do little to change the basic picture: Tehran is getting a massive windfall. Newly un-sanctioned Quds Force General Qasem Soleimani will be freer to spread mayhem across the region (if not the world).

Instead, he said, \u201cWe want everything out front.\u201d\n\nPaying tribute to Sharpton and his group\u2019s work over the course of the four-day festival at the Times Square Sheraton in Manhattan are three Cabinet-level officials in the Obama White House, plus former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs; no fewer than four mayors; most of the city and statewide elected officials of New York; and three would-be 2016 presidential contenders: Bernie Sanders, Martin O\u2019Malley, and Republican Ben Carson.\n\nNot there is Hillary Clinton, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee.\n\nIf Sharpton is now mainstream, Clinton may be the last to get the memo. The two have a fraught history, even though the former first lady called Sharpton on his birthday last year\u2014a fact known because the reverend blasted it out in a press release apparently as soon as they hung up. Back in 2008, Sharpton told his congregation, \u201cHillary Clinton has never done nothing for us.\u201d More recently, he pushed back on the widely held notion that the 2014 midterm Democratic drubbing was due to Obama\u2019s popularity, aping Republicans who hung the loss around the Clintons since they spent so much time out on the campaign trail.\n\nWith a row of honorees on the stage, Sharpton told the convention that the next day\u2019s story would be that \u201cde Blasio is whispering to Sanders! So de Blasio is giving up on Hillary.\u201d\n\nOn the first day of the convention, which ends Saturday, Sharpton laid out his group\u2019s plans for 2016, which included touring the early primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire to promote voting rights. One of the few times Clinton was publicly mentioned came when Sharpton decided to poke at the media. With a row of honorees on the stage, Sharpton told the convention that the next day\u2019s story would be that \u201cde Blasio is whispering to Sanders! So de Blasio is giving up on Hillary.\u201d\n\nDe Blasio was not, at the time, whispering to Sanders.\n\nWithout Clinton, the wooing of the Sharpton contingent fell to unlikely contenders like Carson, who was booed when Sharpton spoke his name, and Sanders, whom Sharpton touted as a progressive fighter, even as he introduced him as \u201cSen. Bernie Saunders.\u201d\n\nSanders, the lone socialist in the United States Senate, delivered a version of stump speech that he has been giving to college campuses and progressive gatherings as he inches closer to a presidential run, railing against oligarchs like the Koch brothers and the Walton family, jabbing the air with his whole arm, his white hair tufted around his head in a gravity-defying display.\n\nIt was the kind of speech that liberals have been begging Clinton to deliver. Sanders called the current minimum wage \u201ca starvation wage\u201d and hit back against Republican criticism of Democratic efforts to reduce income inequality by pointing out that \u201cthere has been a massive transfer of wealth. The only problem is that it is has been in the wrong direction.\u201d\n\nAfter the speech, de Blasio did offer high praise for Sanders, calling the senator someone \u201cI\u2019ve been a fan of\u2026 going back to his time as the mayor of Burlington, Vermont.\u201d De Blasio declined to comment on Clinton, citing her continued lack of a campaign, but did say a \u201cforthright message on how we will address economic unfairness and create a more balanced society again in terms of economic opportunity is absolutely necessary for anyone running at this point for 2016.\u201d\n\nThis line was echoed elsewhere.\n\nDemocrats win, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka told The Daily Beast, when they start \u201cdealing with the base of the party, the base of Americans who have come together to vote for the president of the United States twice in a row. That group of people needs to be catered to and needs to be expanded and needs to be strengthened. Democrats win if they come out with a clear message that counters all this reaction that is going on in this country.\u201d\n\nAsked if that meant he was ready for Clinton, as so many in his party are, Baraka replied, \u201cI am ready for a change, man. I am ready for a continuation of progressive politics in America. The president ran up against some brick walls. We need to push past those walls even further, and any candidate that is willing to do that, I am ready for them.\u201d\n\nOne member of the National Action Network rank-and-file said that what he liked about Clinton was that \u201cshe seems to be the one most likely to win, and I want to see the presidency remain with the Democrats.\u201d\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders is excellent,\u201d said Mack Williams, who came in from New Jersey for the convention. \u201cI like him. And of course everybody loves Elizabeth Warren, as well.\u201d\n\nIt is unlikely that African Americans would vote for Clinton in the same numbers they did for Obama in 2008 and 2012. But they remain a crucial Democratic voting bloc and one that Republicans are desperately trying to court. According to Robert Gibbs, who helped engineer Obama\u2019s victory and who appeared on a panel on Wednesday, groups like the National Action Network are crucial to the Democratic cause.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a very, very close election,\u201d he said. \u201cThe outcome is going to depend on who is the most energized, who is the most organized, and who gets activated.\u201d\n\nOne of those Republicans vying for the votes of the Sharpton crowd is Carson, a retired neurosurgeon.\n\nBut Carson, who has had trouble staying on message, spent most of his remarks walking back some of his earlier comments, including a comparison of Obamacare to slavery.\n\nA lie, he told the audience: \u201cI said since slavery,\u201d he tried to clarify.\n\nSharpton looked on, mostly unamused, particularly when Carson, in discussing the recent spate of police shootings, said blacks have to \u201crecognize that we have people who do not obey the law, and are thugs, and when we try to hold them up as heroes, it makes our legitimate complaints not as substantial.\u201d\n\nStill, Carson was well-received, and afterward Sharpton told the conventioneers, \u201cYou may not be my choice for president, but if I need surgery, you my man.\u201d\n\nAnd with that, he called the convention to a brief break in the proceedings.

{"entityId": 1902, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, it can get worse, and it is. So now The Donald is speaking next Wednesday at an anti-Iran deal rally sponsored by three hate groups.\n\nOver the past week, Donald Trump has been called out by many in the media, including myself, for his failure to denounce the growing number of white supremacist groups publicly endorsing him.\n\nTrump attracting the support of these groups is not happenstance. Not only has he served up harsh, hateful rhetoric about immigrants, but Trump has courted nativist groups when he retweeted a person urging him to \u201cGet to the WHITE House\u201d (caps in the original), and in July when he tweeted a photo featuring Nazi imagery along with the hashtag, \u201c#MakeAmericaGreatAgain.\u201d (Trump\u2019s campaign blamed an intern for the Nazi image.)\n\nDespite attracting the support of these hate groups, Trump has not as of yet attended an event sponsored by one. But that will all change on September 9. That\u2019s the day Trump, along with Ted Cruz, is scheduled to speak at anti Iran deal rally in Washington, D.C., co-sponsored by three groups that have a long stoked hate versus Muslims: The Center for Security Policy, Tea Party Patriots, and the Zionist Organization of America. The worst of the three, by far, is Frank Gaffney\u2019s Center for Security Policy.\n\nJust so it\u2019s absolutely clear, I have zero problem with Trump opposing the Iran deal. I, too, have concerns about the proposed agreement. The issue is why would the leading GOP presidential candidate join forces with these three organizations, especially Gaffney\u2019s?\n\nNot only has he served up harsh, hateful rhetoric about immigrants, but Trump has courted nativist groups when he retweeted a person urging him to \u201cGet to the WHITE House.\u201d\n\nFor those unaware, let me give you a quick primer on Gaffney and his jihad against Muslims. Gaffney is not a run-of-the-mill Muslim hater. As the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that has been tracking hate groups since the 1970s, notes, Gaffney is \u201cone of America\u2019s most notorious Islamophobes.\u201d That\u2019s pretty impressive considering the number of people engaged in anti-Muslim bigotry in America today.\n\nGaffney, who the SPLC notes was \u201conce a respectable Washington insider,\u201d has served up some of the most toxic crap toward Muslims. Gaffney was the person behind Michele Bachmann\u2019s outlandish claims in 2012 that there had been \u201cdeep penetration in the halls of our United States government by the Muslim Brotherhood.\u201d\n\nGaffney himself has claimed that the Muslim Brotherhood has infiltrated every part of the \u201cU.S. government and civil institutions.\u201d Gaffney even publicly praised the House Un-American Activities Committee and called for Congress \u201cto establish a new and improved counterpart\u201d to root our Muslims in our government who are not loyal to our country.\n\nAnd the SPLC is far from the only group that has denounced Gaffney. The Anti-Defamation League, on its page dedicated to the leaders of anti-Muslim bigotry movement, note that Gaffney \u201cpioneered the anti Shariah hysteria by publishing materials regarding the threat of an Islamic takeover of the U.S.\u201d\n\nEven prominent conservatives have denounced Gaffney\u2019s extremism. CPAC banned Gaffney beginning in 2011 for his baseless attacks on not just Muslims in general, but even on fellow conservatives who Gaffney claimed had ties to Islamic radicals. One of Gaffney\u2019s most vile attacks was on Grover Norquist. Is Norquist Muslim? No, but his wife is and that was too much for Gaffney. Consequently, he wanted Norquist banned from conservative events.\n\nThe other two groups co-sponsoring the anti-Iran deal rally, the Zionist of America (ZOA) and Tea Party Patriots (TPP) also have a troubling record.\n\nAs the SPLC notes, the TPP\u2019s membership \u201cincludes militia members and racists.\u201d The TPP has hosted the anti-Muslim leader Pam Geller at their events. And disturbingly some of its chapters have worked with anti-Semites and anti-immigrant hate groups. In fact, TPP\u2019s Arizona chapter has \u201cpromoted tours of the Arizona/Mexico border by nativist and anti-Semite Glenn Spencer, who runs the hate group American Border Patrol.\u201d\n\nAnd the ZOA has decried the term \u201clslamophobia,\u201d writing on its website that the fear of Muslims is not an \u201cirrational fear of an imaginary threat, which is what the word \u2018phobia\u2019 denotes.\u201d Rather, ZOA argues it\u2019s justifiable given the acts of terror carried out by Muslims.\n\nDo I think that documenting the hateful history of the groups co-sponsoring the rally will sway Trump to cancel? Of course not. In fact, I bet if you asked Trump about Muslims, he would say \u201cI love the Muslims,\u201d just like he \u201cloves Latinos,\u201d while inciting hate against their entire community with his fear mongering.\n\nBut the GOP frontrunner appears to be moving from simply having hate groups support him to attending events sponsored by them. True, we saw that before when Steve Scalise, the third-ranking member in the Republican House leadership, attended a white supremacist meeting in 2002. But at least Scalise publicly apologized for his appearance and stated clearly he rejects the organization\u2019s racist ideology.\n\nDon\u2019t expect the same from Trump. In fact, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if before this campaign is over that Trump attends even more events organized by hate groups in his desperate effort to \u201cGet to the WHITE House.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:15.336+0000"}

They hire campaign advisers, fund-raise, travel across the country (suspiciously, often to primary states!), give a slightly different version of the same speech to dozens of crowds, kiss babies, maybe even wage war with the opposing party\u2019s likely nominee\u2026but they won\u2019t yet say I am running for president.\n\nMore than being an issue of waiting for the perfect moment to arise, or to hear back from whatever deity was consulted about the matter, it should come as no surprise that a non-candidate\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the presidential campaign that he or she is most certainly running is all about money.\n\nAnd tip-toeing around those five words can be very awkward.\n\n\u201cThey have access to a much broader array of money and they don\u2019t have to disclose the sources of that if they are not candidates.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the best example of this came on February 27, when former Florida Governor Jeb Bush arrived at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland. Bush appeared onstage to answer questions from Fox News host Sean Hannity, who began by asking, as Murrow might have, \u201cAre you mad at your mom?\u201d\n\nIn 2014, Barbara Bush made headlines when she expressed her distaste for political dynasties. \u201cIf we can't find more than two or three families to run for higher office, that\u2019s silly. Because there are great governors and great eligible people to run,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind that Jeb is the best-qualified person to run for president, but I hope he won\u2019t\u2026. There are other families. I refuse to accept that this great country isn\u2019t raising other wonderful people.\u201d\n\nBush chuckled uncomfortably at Hannity\u2019s question. His mother, he said, \u201chad a change of heart, and that\u2019s all right by me.\u201d\n\nWink wink.\n\nBut a few moments later, Bush found graceful avoidance more difficult to achieve: \u201cIf I go beyond the consideration of the possibility of running, which is the legal terminology that people here coming to CPAC are probably using to, uh, not trigger a campaign\u2014if I get beyond that and I run for president, I have to show what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d\n\nThe consideration of the possibility\u2026\n\nI reached former commissioner and chairman of the Federal Election Commission, Trevor Potter, by phone on Monday. He explained that \u201cthe reason these people running for president are trying to avoid saying they\u2019re candidates is that they have much looser regulatory schemes if they\u2019re not candidates.\u201d\n\n\u201cPut differently, they have access to a much broader array of money and they don\u2019t have to disclose the sources of that if they are not candidates.\u201d\n\nAnd unfortunately for wannabe candidates, the FEC has a very Andy Warhol philosophy when it comes to identity. As far as the FEC is concerned, a candidate is anyone who calls himself or herself a candidate (and who raises or spends more than $5,000 to promote the candidacy).\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a chicken-and-egg situation,\u201d Potter said. As in, what came first: the declaration of a candidacy, or the candidate-like behavior?\n\n\u201cThere are rules for what money may be used to run for president: only individual contributions up to only $2,700 per person. Whereas people who are not running for president and merely going around the country giving speeches and meeting people can use almost any source of money, in any amount, with no disclosure. So that puts a premium on staying outside of the election system for as long as possible.\u201d\n\nIt makes sense, of course, that those considering running might want to, as Rand Paul told me in January, \u201ctest the waters\u201d by traveling the country before diving into a race, and maybe assembling a campaign apparatus in the shadows isn\u2019t in itself such a bad thing\u2014but it seems symptomatic of the broader, deeper problem of the influence of money, particularly \u201cdark money\u201d from superPACs, usurping the democratic process.\n\nI asked Potter if the pre-campaign campaign system was basically \u201ca huge scam,\u201d to which he enthusiastically replied \u201cYes!\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:15.472+0000"}

Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to a number of prominent journalists. So is Podesta right?\n\nNot really. His claim rates Mostly False.\n\nClinton has avoided saying whether she definitively supports the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement and the fast-track trade authority many believe is necessary to make the deal happen.\n\nPresident Barack Obama has asked for fast-track trade authority to complete the Asian trade agreement, only to be rebuked by members of his own party.\n\nOn Sunday, Clinton discussed the trade agreements, but only in general terms. Speaking in Iowa, Clinton said that Obama should \u201cwork with his allies in Congress\u201d to ensure better protection for workers and \u201cto make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible.\u201d Even though she urged Congress and Obama to make some changes to the deal, she didn\u2019t specify the exact changes, nor did she explicitly express overall support or disapproval.\n\nOn other occasions, Clinton has said that any trade agreement must increase jobs and be good for national security.\n\n\u201cI've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards,\u201d she said in May.\n\nGiven the context of the current debate in Congress, it\u2019s hard for a neutral observer to call Clinton\u2019s position clear.\n\nAlso on Sunday, pundits previewed Monday\u2019s long-awaited announcement that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush would be running for president. George Will was asked on Fox News Sunday to address criticism that Bush is too moderate and shares too many positions with Democrats, particularly on immigration and education policy.\n\nWill said the criticism was mainly nonsense, saying that Bush was \u201cmeasurably more conservative\u201d than Ronald Reagan during Bush\u2019s two terms as governor.\n\nOn immigration, Bush \u201chappens to be where a majority of Republicans are,\u201d Will said, in support of a pathway to legal status people living in the United States illegally.\n\nThat rates Mostly True.\n\nFor the record, Bush\u2019s position on immigration has been complicated as he has flip-flopped on legal status over the years. But Bush\u2019s most recent comments suggest a pathway to legal status, so we think Will\u2019s point is fair.\n\nWith that in mind, the latest report from the Pew Research Center bolsters Will\u2019s claim. Pew\u2019s survey found that 56 percent of Republicans favor a path to legal status, not to be confused with citizenship. Legal status would allow undocumented adults to work and pay taxes, but they would not be able to vote.\n\nHowever, George Hawley, a political scientist at the University of Houston, cautions that the Pew survey also shows a complicated set of attitudes.\n\n\u201cA majority of Republicans also felt that giving people who came to the United States illegally a way to gain legal status is like rewarding them for doing something wrong,\u201d Hawley said.\n\n\u201cFurther, 42 percent of Republicans felt legal immigration should be decreased, compared to 21 percent who think it should be increased. Also, far more Republicans view immigrants as a burden, 63 percent, than view them as an asset for the country, 27 percent.\u201d\n\nStephen Nuno, a political scientist at Northern Arizona University, said that Republicans \u201csee mass deportation to be unrealistic,\u201d and that when Republicans feel better about the economy, they tend to take a more pragmatic view on undocumented immigrants.\n\nAaron Sharockman and Anna Bruzgulis contributed to this report.

Whether that\u2019s a late bargaining chip, a show of bad faith (though not a technical violation of the agreement) or both, it complicates the final deal.\n\n\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his neocon friends in the U.S. insist that talk of inevitable war if there\u2019s no agreement is just an Obama scare tactic. And they insist that there\u2019s evidence of nuclear materials at an Iranian military base in Parchin. That\u2019s a further deal breaker for them and at least another complication for the U.S. negotiating team.\n\nBut after eight years in which President Bush largely neglected Iran\u2019s rapidly-growing nuclear program, these neocons (who chose to attack Iraq rather than confront Iran) still aren\u2019t on strong logical ground when arguing that no deal is the best option now.\n\nObama and Secretary of State John Kerry are appeasers, they say. If the talks fail, no sweat. We\u2019ll just apply tougher sanctions until the Iranians come crawling back to the table. This is currently the position of close to 100 percent of Republicans in Congress.\n\nIf only it were so simple. In the real world that these muddle-headed hard-liners apparently don\u2019t inhabit, the multilateral sanctions that Obama so painstakingly built during his first term are crumbling. Russia is already selling a sophisticated missile defense system to Teheran and European corporations are itching to trade again with Iran. Congress could impose the harshest sanctions imaginable and Iran would easily circumvent them.\n\nOf course this reduced leverage doesn\u2019t mean that the U.S. should give in on the critical fine print of the deal. As in any negotiation, one or both parties may walk away from the talks (or threaten to) at the 11th hour. The big ones always require some brinksmanship at the end.\n\nAt Camp David in 1978, President Carter was sure the talks had failed only hours before the breakthrough. At Dayton in 1995, the late Richard Holbrooke, the lead negotiator, had to conspicuously place the luggage of the U.S. delegation at the curb, signaling that the Americans were leaving, before the warring parties in the former Yugoslavia came back for one final fruitful session.\n\nGoing back to his days in the Illinois State Senate, Obama has been a poker player, though he doesn\u2019t always play his hand well with Congress. Now he has to hold and fold with great finesse. If the president is too anxious for a deal and doesn\u2019t double-rivet the details on inspections and snap-back sanctions, a cheating Iran\u2014bent on a nuclear bomb\u2014will overshadow his domestic accomplishments and render him a na\u00eff on foreign policy.\n\nIf, on the other hand, there\u2019s no deal, Iran will be only months away from a nuclear breakout status that would present the world with a fait accompli. Either path could easily lead to war.\n\n\u201cThere are enough people in the government with real knowledge that if they really thought this was a [White House] snow job, you\u2019d know about it.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s strategy\u2014sound in theory\u2014has been to play for time and transparency with the hope that Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, ill with cancer, will have passed from the scene when this deal expires in a decade. But the strategy depends on a genuinely intrusive inspections regime to give the world confidence that Iran is living up to the terms of the agreement.\n\nAs Iran sponsors terrorism in countries across the Middle East and imprisons innocents (including a Washington Post reporter) on trumped-up charges, who isn\u2019t tempted to stalk off? But that\u2019s when it\u2019s important to remember that diplomacy is most significant when conducted with enemies, not friends. Recall the deals Ronald Reagan struck with what he called \u201cthe evil empire.\u201d\n\nOf course Khamenei isn\u2019t exactly Mikhail Gorbachev. He gave a graduation speech last week reiterating that Iran would allow no inspections of military bases or \u201cinterrogation\u201d of nuclear scientists. These aren\u2019t deal breakers, but they underline how much work remains in the next month.\n\nSince March, I\u2019ve been worried about the creation of a commission to approve inspections. It seemed to be a recipe for endless litigation of where and when International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspectors could do their jobs. But a majority-rule provision means that even if Iran, Russia, and China object to an inspection, Western nations can insist on it. \u201cIf we want access, we get it,\u201d one senior White House official told me.\n\nBut isn\u2019t the exclusion of military bases a huge loophole that Iran could drive a truck of fissile material through? Not really.\n\nFirst, \u201canytime, anywhere\u201d access to military bases would be an assault on the sovereignty of any country. (We didn\u2019t have it with the Soviet Union). And given that\u2019s there\u2019s no evidence of any weaponization (warheads on missiles, bombs ready to be loaded on planes), such access isn\u2019t necessary. What\u2019s relevant is whether Iran agrees to what the experts call \u201curanium accountancy\u201d\u2014strict oversight of the supply chain of all uranium (not to mention the plutonium banned under the deal). That needs more specificity in the final agreement, but the details so far are encouraging.\n\nLike so much else in our daily lives, the world of inspections has been changed by cameras. The preliminary deal calls for \u201ccontinuous video monitoring\u201d at all facilities handling nuclear materials. Equally significant is the inclusion of a \u201cdedicated procurement channel,\u201d which means that the purchase by Iran of any dual-use technologies that could used in building a bomb (or moving nuclear materials to military bases) would be closely monitored. Since the interim agreement in November of 2013, the IAEA has had daily access to key sites, which apparently would also be part of any final deal.\n\nThe U.S. technical experts I spoke with outlined \u201cnumerous new trip wires,\u201d \u201cmany additional data points\u201d and a \u201cnew suite of tools\u201d to prevent and detect cheating.\n\n\u201cThis is the world\u2019s hardest obstacle course if you\u2019re a proliferator,\u201d said one, adding that the relative absence of leaks from non-political career nuclear specialists in Washington was significant: \u201cThere are enough people in the government with real knowledge that if they really thought this was a [White House] snow job, you\u2019d know about it.\u201d\n\nThis hardly means that Kerry won\u2019t have to hang tough in Geneva next month, likely pulling an all-nighter around June 29 and maybe even walking out. Iran will have to back off its demand that all sanctions must be lifted first\u2014before it does anything to fulfill its end of the bargain\u2014and that inspectors cannot interact with the nuclear scientists who handle the equipment they are inspecting.\n\nThis is not only possible, but likely. Recall how only last year Khamenei was indignantly demanding that Iran keep 100,000 centrifuges; the deal now calls for 6,000, a more manageable number to monitor. Iran will likely allow interviews with scientists, as long as they are not described as \u201cinterrogations.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople think we\u2019re too eager for a deal,\u201d a senior administration official told me. \u201cActually, they\u2019re the ones who have raised public expectations. They will suffer an enormous letdown if this deal collapses and they have a lot of incentive to get it done.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re about to find out how much. From introducing health care reform over the objection of his aides to approving the raid on Osama bin Laden\u2019s suspected compound, Barack Obama has been a risk-taking president. This one may be his biggest bet of all.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:16.311+0000"}

This guy runs the committee that\u2019s demanding all of my emails from when I was secretary of state and he won\u2019t release any of his own emails from Congress. Why? He\u2019s afraid they\u2019ll show the whole thing is a huge political deal\u2014a setup. Which it is. Disgusting.\n\nLook, this is the same old double standard from when Bill and I were huge in the \u201990s. Colin Powell is a nice guy. I like him, he likes me. All the blacks like me. They don\u2019t like Bernie Sanders. But Colin Powell had a private email account the whole time he was secretary of state, and if you think nothing classified ever got there accidentally, I got a bridge in Brooklyn to sell ya. By the way, a billion other Cabinet guys in both parties had private email accounts, and good for them. It\u2019s like having a private cellphone number. Same deal. Nobody\u2019s business. You know what? If those bureaucrats scrape my server and recover my personal deleted emails, I\u2019m going to sue the government to keep \u2019em private. Watch me.\u201d\n\nTrump disgusts me and I\u2019m sure he disgusts Clinton. He is hardly a model for her behavior or anyone else\u2019s. But Hillary has a lot to learn from The Donald about how to handle herself in the circus that has become our politics. Trump could teach Clinton a thing or two about trust, risk-taking, and counter-punching. Instead of feeling embarrassed for celebrity-slumming at his wedding, she should ask herself every so often: WWDD. What Would Donald Do?\n\nNew polls show that large and growing numbers of voters don\u2019t trust Clinton. For people like me who covered Bill Clinton in the 1990s, that seems like no big deal right now. In the spring of 1992\u2014after revelations that he was a philanderer, a draft dodger, and a \u201cSlick Willie\u201d in Arkansas\u2014Bill Clinton was running third in the polls behind incumbent President George H.W. Bush and independent billionaire Ross Perot. Four months later, Clinton was easily elected president, though voters still gave him low marks on trust. Six years after that, amid the Lewinsky scandal, Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Missouri) famously said she wouldn\u2019t trust the president to babysit her daughter. Clinton went on to leave office with sky-high approval ratings.\n\nBut Hillary is not a lovable rogue like her husband. She is cleaner than Bill but wears less Teflon. The pattern with her going back to her days as first lady is a cover-up\u2014or at least suspicious damage control\u2014without a crime. Recall her disastrous \u201cPretty in Pink\u201d press conference on the largely phony Whitewater scandal (which made her seem dodgy and legalistic); her misplacing of the Rose law firm billing records (which made her appear as if she was hiding something when the records showed nothing); and her testimony before a grand jury (which made her look like a crook when she wasn\u2019t).\n\nWhen asked about his penchant for personal attacks, Trump says he\u2019s just punching back. And it\u2019s true: Almost everyone he calls a loser has insulted him first.\n\nIn the end, Hillary survives because she only seems guilty of something without being so. Even with the coming drip, drip, drip of leaks about whether she mishandled classified emails (which is what happens when an FBI investigation starts), she is unlikely to be forced from the race by this story, Joe Biden\u2019s wishful thinking notwithstanding.\n\nBut she is already being hurt by it. Those low trust numbers could lead to a few primary and caucus losses to Biden, if he runs, or Bernie Sanders, who leads in New Hampshire in a new poll. Even if Hillary wins the nomination\u2014still likely\u2014low trust ratings would weaken her against a Republican, especially one like Marco Rubio, who can claim to represent change. Bill Clinton won in 1992 because a change theme usually beats a trust theme in politics. But if you have neither trust nor change on your side\u2014and seem like a candidate from the last century\u2014you\u2019re in a pickle.\n\nHillary\u2019s problem is not the emails story itself, but her response to it, which has been halting and defensive. The reason so many voters don\u2019t trust Hillary is she doesn\u2019t trust them. Trust is reciprocal. If she trusted the public more, she would be mixing it up in the media more, like Trump, and betting that the public will eventually sort out the truth. Hillary is taking a 1990s control freak approach to a media environment that is fundamentally uncontrollable. She has aides and supporters defending her instead of vigorously making her case to all comers. Trump knows that you have to assert yourself every day and counter-attack to stay on top of the story.\n\nWhy is a charlatan like Trump seen as \u201cauthentic\u201d? Because he is spontaneous and\u2014in a reality show, non-financial way\u2014transparent. His motive for being out there all the time (megalomania) isn\u2019t relevant; it\u2019s the effect of his spontaneity that is instructive. Trump is far sleazier than Hillary, as the documentary Trump: What\u2019s the Deal? explains in detail. But even with all his lying, he seems open.\n\nShe\u2019s cover-up with no crime; he\u2019s crime (or at least reports of employing undocumented immigrants for building demolition and dealing with mobbed-up unions) with no cover-up. As we know from Watergate, the cover-up is always worse than the crime.\n\nWhy these self-inflicted wounds? Because Hillary and her communications team have an old-fashioned view of what constitutes \u201cmedia.\u201d She has 4 million Twitter followers, a few more than Trump, and a bunch of social media hipsters at work in her Brooklyn HQ. But no one there seems to get that old media and social media are converging into an immense wave that can only be surfed, not managed.\n\nThey think she can go around old media to connect with new media. Bill Clinton did that in 1992, playing the saxophone on Arsenio Hall and appearing on MTV. Mainstream media were dinosaurs, his people thought. But after he was president they learned the hard way that dinosaurs bite.\n\nThey still do, only now the effect of bad press is greatly magnified by social media. Yes, Clinton supporters have more ways to fight back than in the 1990s, when conservatives dominated talk radio and progressives had no space to counter-attack. But reinforcements only help if the candidate is leading the charge.\n\nTo do that, Hillary needs to take more risks, as Trump learned from the business world. Clayton Christensen of Harvard Business School argues that by abstaining from certain risks, businesses actually invite greater risk. (For example, marketing plans without healthy uncertainty built in are destined to under-perform.) The same applies to Hillary going weeks on end this summer without answering questions. That defensive crouch put her at greater risk than being out there for constant scrutiny\u2014a scrutiny that occurs whether she talks to the press or not.\n\nHillary doesn\u2019t get the most basic fact of media relations: Reporters are easy lays. Recall how well John McCain did in 2000 by giving reporters full access aboard his campaign bus. Trump last week invited selected reporters (the highest paid, of course) to ride on his helicopter. Guess what? He got softball coverage. Same thing goes when he calls into TV shows.\n\n\u201cA lot of people build a brand and they study it very carefully, and every move is calculated. My moves are not calculated. My moves are totally uncalculated,\u201d Trump says in TrumpNation: The Art of Being The Donald (2005). Hillary will never stop calculating. It\u2019s not in her nature. But moving even a little in Trump\u2019s spontaneous, risk-taking direction would help.\n\nThe same goes for emulating Trump the counter-puncher. When asked about his penchant for personal attacks, Trump says he\u2019s just punching back. And it\u2019s true: Almost everyone he calls a loser has insulted him first.\n\nHillary seems to be learning this lesson. At a banquet last Friday in Iowa, she told a cheering crowd, \u201cIt\u2019s not about emails or servers. It\u2019s about politics,\u201d before adding a reference to Snapchat: \u201cI love it. Those messages disappear all by themselves.\u201d\n\nSpoken like The Donald.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:16.669+0000"}
{"entityId": 1907, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Michael Eric Dyson is on the money: There\u2019s a new model now of black intellectual leadership, and West is yesterday\u2019s news.\n\nMichael Eric Dyson\u2019s blistering takedown of Cornel West in The Ghost of Cornel West for The New Republic not only closed the door on a decades-long friendship that arguably led the way in black American thought at the end of the 20th century, but also displayed how the roles of black leaders have evolved during Barack Obama\u2019s rise to prominence.\n\nDyson starts off by describing West\u2019s animus toward the president as a love that has turned into a hatred so severe that it would make the heavens shudder. He mentions the times when West called Obama a \u201cRockefeller Republican in blackface,\u201d on Democracy Now! and a \u201cbrown-faced Clinton\u201d in Salon magazine. He discusses a moment when West told him, Dyson, that he does not \u201crespect the brother at all,\u201d referring to Obama. All this in the first two paragraphs.\n\nAs the piece winds its way to the conclusion that solidifies the end of their personal and professional relationship, a narrative of West emerges as a man of supreme intellect who thought that he had reached the pinnacle of African-American thought. West had even gone so far as to start referring to himself as a prophet. He believed that he was the voice that the black community would run to when in need of clarity. Dyson was one of those voices early on, so West\u2019s fall from grace in his eyes is all the more striking. He was a self-anointed prophet, who has publicly lost one of his most significant disciples and a friend.\n\nApparently, it was the release of Race Matters in the mid-\u201990s that placed West at the pinnacle, and he intended on staying there for life. He did not need to publish new, thought-provoking works. His lack of output was disappointing, and so were his verbal attacks toward others in the black community, especially at MSNBC contributor and professor Melissa Harris-Perry.\n\nStill, he potentially could have recovered from both of these errors. Yet he decided to rest on his laurels from here to eternity, and as he did so, time, unbeknownst to him, began passing him by. When Obama showed up, and politely challenged West\u2019s idyllic place at the summit, West responded venomously to challenge this young, brash usurper.\n\nWest became incredulous when Obama chose to speak in front of the people who elected him instead of those within the black community.\n\nWest was not the only person to challenge Obama\u2019s place within the black community\u2014Jesse Jackson had very choice words for Obama, too\u2014but he is one of the few whose perspective has not evolved with the passage of time, and nothing could be more damning for an intellectual. Yet the key thing to remember is that Obama did not take West\u2019s position at the summit; he instead built a taller mountain and sat atop it.\n\nThis recent evolution of black leadership in American society always makes me think about a conversation I had with my grandfather on the eve of the 2008 Iowa caucuses.\n\nDuring the conversation, he explained to me that he intended on voting for Hillary Clinton for president because he did not believe that white people would allow Obama to become president of the United States. My grandfather was an educated man, a minister, and a veteran of the Korean War, but mentally it was absolutely impossible for him to believe that Obama could become the next president.\n\nI did not agree with his perspective, but I knew where it came from, and it made me wonder more and more about how one\u2019s environment and experiences can drastically shape what you can believe is possible in the world.\n\nMost times when I tell this story, I need to follow it up with a simplifying analogy to explain how this perspective could have come into being. In this analogy, I condense America to a k-through-12 school.\n\nAt the beginning of America, blacks were unpaid laborers at the school. Then we became paid laborers, and then we were able to have our own classes, and through this structure, influential black teachers were able to emerge. These teachers made progress within the school and created lasting changes, but the goal was always to become one of these beloved teachers and to make change through this medium. Many of the most influential black leaders in America were teachers or educated through the church. W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington were both teachers. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X taught from the pulpit. Dyson and West used both media, the classroom and the pulpit.\n\nObama, on the other hand, specialized in neither, even though he taught at the University of Chicago. Instead he took the administrative route. He wanted to be the principal of the school, and that meant he could not teach full time, and this is where the conflict has largely emerged.\n\nPeople like my grandfather did not believe that it would be possible to have a black principal. Many within the African-American community wanted to know if Obama would be able to teach class full time, because in their minds teaching was what black Americans had always done; and when he said that he could not, they questioned his motives and integrity.\n\nWhen Obama won the presidency the opportunities for black thought and leadership expanded. My grandfather was beside himself with joy that night because he had lived to witness the previously thought impossible. What he thought was possible in the world had now expanded. Innumerable black Americans felt the same. A new level of attainment in public life was now possible.\n\nYet despite this progress, the need remained for great black teachers, and now a new question emerged: How would the teachers themselves handle no longer being arguably the most influential voice in the Obama era?\n\nDyson and other black leaders have taken a healthy position of comfortably and even vehemently disagreeing with Obama on policy issues, but respecting the man for the position he has earned and what it has done for the black community.\n\nWest clearly did not take this change well and instead opted to sternly rebuff this paradigm shift that undermined his influence.\n\nDyson details West\u2019s anger when Obama did not give him tickets to the inauguration, and he mentions how West \u201clambasted\u201d Obama when the then-junior senator from Illinois decided to announce his candidacy for the presidency in Illinois instead of at Tavis Smiley\u2019s State of the Black Union meeting in Virginia.\n\nWest wanted Obama to visit his class, and he became incredulous when the candidate chose to speak in front of the people who elected him instead of those within the black community. West either did not see the shift or chose to ignore it.\n\nWhen West did not receive inauguration tickets his fury was that of someone who did not understand that the party could go on without him.\n\nHe wanted everyone to love him for his brilliance, and forgot to use his intellect for the benefit of others. He stopped being a teacher, refused to be a student, and wanted to be a prophet.\n\nThe leadership roles that black Americans can obtain has changed in the last decade and this has required an evolution of thought amongst black intellectuals and leaders, and a re-examining of roles within the black community.\n\nWest was once both an intellectual and a leader, but as the times changed, he did not. And now progress, thought, and leadership have moved forward without him.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:18.161+0000"}
{"entityId": 1908, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The short history of a Democratic presidential hopeful\u2019s decades-long fight with his party\u2019s base about Vietnam.\n\nJim Webb just may be the most unusual, compelling presidential candidate around: He\u2019s a much-decorated Vietnam combat veteran whose heroics make Hollywood war heroes pale by comparison. In an era of ghost-written Tweets, he\u2019s an acclaimed novelist, screenwriter, and journalist. He was Ronald Reagan\u2019s Secretary of the Navy whose early, prescient opposition to the Iraq War brought him back to the Democratic Party\u2014where his views on guns, the environment, Southern culture, and affirmative action are not exactly in synch with his party\u2019s base.\n\nBut there\u2019s a far more fundamental sense in which Webb stands in startling contrast to the root assumptions of Democrats about an issue that divided (and then shaped) his party for almost half a century: the Vietnam War. What Webb believes about that war, and specifically about those who opposed it, still makes him an apostate, if not a heretic, in the party whose presidential nomination he now seeks.\n\nWith the exception of race, no question split the Democratic Party more than Vietnam. In 1968, it helped drive the incumbent Democrat to abandon a re-election fight, and left the convention a shambles. By 1972, anti-war activists had rewritten the nominating rules and got one of their own, George McGovern, as the nominee. This led the more hawkish elements of the party (including organized labor) to withhold support, and, over time, turned neo-conservative Democrats into Republicans.\n\nJimmy Carter unconditionally pardoned all Vietnam draft evaders and resisters on his first day in office. And the fight at home over the war served as the incubator for the next generation of Democratic leaders. Bill Clinton\u2019s youthful experiences as a protester and with the draft were significant campaign issues. John Kerry came to prominence as a combat veteran who denounced the war at a Senate hearing; those denunciations, in turn, triggered the \u201cSwift Boat\u201d ads that wounded him politically in 2004. For the last several decades, the consensus view among Democrats is that the Vietnam War was a mistake, and that the protests and liberal congressional opposition helped bring an end to a tragedy.\n\n\u201cIf our political leaders had done a better job with their duty, we may have seen a different situation in Vietnam.\u201d\n\nJim Webb believes none of that. He has consistently argued that the Vietnam War was, as Ronald Reagan once put it, a \u201cnoble cause\u201d\u2014that South Vietnam was resisting aggression from the North\u2014and that the picture of a nationalist, indigenous movement of North Vietnamese is a significant distortion. He believes that, for all of the strategic errors imposed (mostly) by a clueless civilian leadership, the war could have been brought to a very different conclusion. (See, for example, his 2003 article \u201cWhy We Fought & Why We Would Do it Again\u201d in the American Legion Magazine.)\n\nWebb believes that after 1973, South Vietnam\u2019s efforts to defend itself were undermined by congressional Democrats and their political allies who were content to let the North conquer Saigon\u2014and that those same forces refused to acknowledge the brutal consequences of that defeat.\n\nBut most striking is Webb\u2019s view of the anti-war movement\u2014and the members of what he once called the \u201cboomer elite\u201d who formed its leaders and foot soldiers. His view of these people doesn\u2019t border on contempt; it crosses that border enthusiastically.\n\n\u201cIt is difficult to explain to my children that in my teens and early twenties the most frequently heard voices of my peers were trying to destroy the foundations of American society, so that it might be rebuilt according to their own narcissistic notions,\u201d he wrote in 1997, in an article for the conservative American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\u201cIn retrospect it\u2019s hard even for some of us who went through those times to understand how highly educated people\u2014most of them spawned from the comforts of the upper-middle class\u2014could have seriously advanced the destructive ideas that were in the air during the late \u201960s and early \u201970s. Even Congress was influenced by the virus.\u201d\n\nIn that same article, he concludes: \u201cAnd what of these elites who misread not only a war but also their own countrymen? Where are they now, other than in the White House?\u201d\n\nKeep in mind the White House occupant he\u2019s knocking there is, of course, President Clinton.\n\nHis view of these boomer elites hasn\u2019t changed much in more recent years. His comments about the Confederate flag have been, to put it mildly, out of step with the rest of his party. And in Born Fighting, his history of America\u2019s Scotch-Irish population published in 2004, Webb talks about \u201credneck\u201d culture this way:\n\n\u201cThe culture so dramatically symbolized by the Southern redneck [is] the greatest inhibitor of the plans of the activist Left and the cultural Marxists for a new kind of society altogether.

As late as April 30, on the 40th anniversary of the fall of Saigon, he said that a \u201cvery liberal, anti-war Congress\u201d cut off funding to the South Vietnamese shortly before Saigon fell to the Vietcong. \u201cIf our political leaders had done a better job with their duty, we may have seen a different situation in Vietnam,\u201d he said.\n\nIs this an echo of what Barack Obama once called \u201cdorm room arguments of the sixties\u201d? In some sense, yes. President Obama now greets the head of the Vietnamese Communist Party at the White House; the U.S. and Vietnam have been trading partners for the better part of 20 years. And Webb\u2019s 2002 warnings about Iraq are in marked contrast to Hillary Clinton\u2019s vote for that war (and her assertions at the time that there may have been a link between Saddam Hussein\u2019s Iraq and al Qaeda).\n\nStill, it\u2019s intriguing that a candidate for his party\u2019s nomination believes so passionately in a set of ideas so at odds with the prevailing beliefs of the party he wants to lead.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:18.335+0000"}

Sadly, Walker forgot his state depends on China to make its economy work.\n\nAdd China to the list of topics that are awkward for Scott Walker.\n\nThis afternoon, the Wisconsin governor and presidential contender raised eyebrows by calling on President Obama to cancel the upcoming state visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to the U.S.\n\n\u201cAmericans are struggling to cope with the fall in today\u2019s markets driven in part by China\u2019s slowing economy and the fact that they actively manipulate their economy,\u201d Walker said in a statement to press. \u201cRather than honoring Chinese President Xi Jinping with an official state visit next month, President Obama should focus on holding China accountable over its increasing attempts to undermine U.S. interests.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: The Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation\u2014which was a key part of Walker\u2019s (unsuccessful) plan to bring 250,000 jobs to the state during his first term as governor, currently has two \u201cGlobal Trade Ventures\u201d advertised in 2016\u2014to China. And in 2013, per Forbes, the governor met with Xi Jinping while in China on a trip promoting trade between his state and the country.\n\n\n\nWEDC\u2019s website lists two trips, one in January of 2016 and another in May.\n\n\u201cAmericans are struggling to cope with the fall in today's markets driven in part by China's slowing economy and the fact that they actively manipulate their economy,\u201d Walker said.\n\n\u201cWhether you\u2019re looking for customers or distributors to help you expand your global reach (or both), WEDC\u2019s targeted trade ventures will help you build the relationships necessary for increased international sales,\u201d the site says. \u201cAs a member of a WEDC trade venture delegation, you will receive a high-level country briefing from WEDC\u2019s market development director before commencing a well-organized tour of the country\u2019s major markets. At each stop, you will participate in pre-arranged, customized meetings with companies whose needs or capabilities align with your export objectives.\u201d\n\nThe first trip, in January, advertises an official WEDC-organized trade venture delegation. The second listed, which WEDC also endorses, is sponsored by the Conference of Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers. The site also notes that China is Wisconsin\u2019s largest trading partner outside of this continent, and that China\u2019s economic growth could be a boon to Wisconsin businesses.\n\n\u201cSocietal changes in China will improve export opportunities for Wisconsin companies,\u201d the site says.\n\n\u201cThe rise of the middle class and urbanization throughout China make it a high-growth market where Wisconsin communities can build on relationships already established,\u201d it continues. \u201cChina\u2019s changes drive demand for products and technology. Meanwhile, Wisconsin businesses could also benefit from offshore service contracts for legal, financial and health care work.\u201d\n\nWalker spoke favorably of trade relations between Wisconsin and China when he visited there.\n\n\n\n\u201cBeijing and Shanghai are still growing populations, growing markets and growing opportunities for us,\u201d he said on the 2013, per Forbes. \u201cThere is tremendous market growth potential for Wisconsin businesses in many different areas,\u201d he added at the time.\n\n\n\nWalker's team doesn't apologize for his criticism of the United States' relationship with China. A Walker aide emailed that the U.S. doesn't need high honors and ceremony from China's president, but rather economic engagement.\n\n\n\nScot Ross, who heads the progressive group One Wisconsin Now, criticized the governor for the apparent incongruency.\n\n\u201cScott Walker doesn\u2019t understand what\u2019s going on in the world and doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in his state,\u201d he said. \u201cIn his desperate attempt to out-Trump Trump, Scott Walker has out-Palined Palin.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty rich for a guy who\u2019s had three positions on immigration in a week to be telling the President to get a backbone,\u201d he added.\n\nWEDC has also drawn a slough of criticism. Beyond failing to deliver on Walker\u2019s promise of 250,000 new jobs, the organization\u2014a public-private partnership that replaced the state\u2019s department of commerce\u2014has drawn bipartisan criticism for giving out awards without formal staff reviews to businesses that later failed.\n\nWalker\u2019s campaign did not immediately return a request for comment.

Anti-choice advocates\u2019 reactions have been no less unseemly, but for a different reason: Their disgust is informed by, and magnified by, glee.\n\nThey sense victory is at hand, that they\u2019ve caught the baby killers redhanded. Count the explanation points in the Tweets, take in the righteous headlines on conservative-leaning sites: \u201cLet\u2019s Face it, Planned Parenthood is Evil,\u201d \u201cBad News, Abortion Enthusiasts,\u201d \u201cThe real lessons of the shameful Planned Parenthood video.\u201d As one of the instigators of the investigation put it: The video \u201cshould be the final nail in the coffin\u201d of the organization. You might be disturbed by a doctor discussing body parts over salad, but I\u2019m a little unnerved that the same conversation has prompted all this dancing in the end zone.\n\nYou can sense the excitement of the undercover actors when Dr. Deborah Nucatola\u2019s frankness crosses the line into something revolting. \u201cWe\u2019ve been very good at heart, lung, liver, because we know that,\u201d Nucatola says while discussing the transfer of fetal tissue. \u201cSo I\u2019m not gonna crush that part, I\u2019m gonna basically crush below, I\u2019m gonna crush above, and I\u2019m gonna see if I can get it all intact.\u201d The activists knew they\u2019d found an image and a soundbite guaranteed to generate shivers among those who don\u2019t usually even think about the abortion debate.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the point: The video\u2019s power depends on reaching people who don\u2019t usually closely follow the abortion debate.\n\nAs I said, pro-choice commentators have pointed out that Nucatola should not be blamed for speaking with professional detachment to people she believed to be equally professional and detached.\n\nIf that seems like a weak excuse to you, you\u2019re not wrong.\n\nHer comments land with such force not just because she\u2019s been desensitized to abortion\u2019s visceral reality by constant exposure to it. Rather, her lack of sensitivity stands out because the vast majority of Americans have the luxury of not being exposed to abortion much at all.\n\nAbortions reached a 30-year low last year, falling by 13 percent since 2011 and by half from the 1981 high. The rate today is just 16.9 abortions per 1,000 women between 15 and 44. And the abortions that are performed today are dramatically less invasive and medically risky than they have been even in the recent past. Thanks to improvements in pregnancy detection and the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d almost 90% of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks of gestation, long before there\u2019s anything to be \u201ccrushed.\u201d So not only has the likelihood of an average American knowing someone who\u2019s had an abortion dropped, but chances are that if you do know someone who\u2019s had an abortion, it wasn\u2019t the kind of brutal procedure Nucatola described: It may not have even happened in a doctor\u2019s office.\n\nToday\u2019s situation, then, is a deeply ironic mirror of the dark pre-Roe past: Abortion is relatively rare and it is mostly not talked about. On some level, that situation is exactly what allowed abortion-rights advocates to succeed.\n\nHer comments land with such force not just because she\u2019s been desensitized to abortion\u2019s visceral reality by constant exposure to it. Rather, her lack of sensitivity stands out because the vast majority of Americans have the luxury of not being exposed to abortion much at all.\n\nPro-choicers can\u2019t really criticize the pro-life movement\u2019s gross-out tactics; we should be intimately familiar with them. Our side understood first that if you want Americans to turn against something, you need to make it too grotesque to ignore. For second-wave feminists, the coathanger was their Nucatola: a cue to instinctual recoil, a way to short-circuit discussion of policy and just get people to react. Back then, it forced a discussion that everyone wanted to be over. Indeed, even abortion access proponents have admitted that the conversation may have been resolved in too much haste. Ruth Bader Ginsberg has pointed out that Roe eschewed women\u2019s rights for the sake of the right to privacy\u2014the Supreme Court\u2019s own way of avoiding icky body parts and bodily functions.\n\nToday\u2019s pro-life activists have figured out how to use revulsion more subtly than their ideological opposites. The Nucatola video is not only more efficacious than the crude signs protesters on both sides show outside clinics, it has an entirely different purpose. It\u2019s not intended to just turn formerly pro-choice individuals into pro-lifers\u2014it\u2019s intended to dilute what \u201cpro-choice\u201d even means.\n\nPortraying legal, medical abortion as a sordid business plays on Americans\u2019 ignorance of what abortion really is\u2014and what Planned Parenthood really does. Setting up Planned Parenthood and Nucatola as craven ogres allows good and reasonable people to think there is a \u201cpro-choice\u201d middle ground between the coathanger past and fetal-tissue-crushing present. They can believe they are \u201cpro-choice,\u201d just not supportive of something so ghastly. They can be pro-choice and still believe themselves insulated against the truly stomach-turning stuff that either side throws at them.\n\nIn fact, more Americans than ever identify as \u201cpro-choice\u201d\u2014but then tell pollsters they are in favor of parental consent laws (favored by 60 percent of \u201cpro-choice\u201d respondents), 24-hour waiting periods (another 60 percent), \u201cinformed consent\u201d requirements (86 percent), and just over half (52 percent) of those in the \u201cpro-choice\u201d camp say that they would make abortion legal only in the first trimester. I haven\u2019t seen surveys on it, but my own experience is that there are plenty of people who support onerous requirements for women\u2019s health centers and consider themselves \u201cpro-choice\u201d as well.\n\nOne friend told me that he hadn\u2019t thought about how those in areas without abortion providers would then get abortions if they needed them. He was just concerned that women be \u201csafe\u201d during the procedure. Pressed, he agreed that closing the clinics would be an unfair burden on many, but, he asked, \u201cWon\u2019t the state supply buses to hospitals or something?\u201d\n\nThose familiar with reproductive health policy aren\u2019t fooled by the seemingly reasonable restrictions that apparently still count as \u201cpro-choice\u201d positions for many. They understand that these restrictions (including those on late-term abortions) have already led to poor and rural women resorting to later- and later-term abortions\u2014and to do-it-yourself abortions as well.\n\nWhen abortion is still mostly legal and mostly safe, professionalized and medicalized, it is of course medical professionals like Nucatola who become inured to the unpleasantness of the abortions that occur later in pregnancy. When abortions are illegal or difficult to obtain, lay people\u2014lay women, specifically, can become depressingly familiar with it, too. Indeed, if you are grossed out by a doctor discussing the abortions she performs herself, try reading up on doctors discussing the abortions they didn\u2019t perform\u2014the ones they had to attend to after an amateur attempted one.\n\nWe can turn this into a Fear Factor contest, exposing Americans to the worst images each side has to offer. Do we really want to rely on disgust to drive our debate? Perhaps there is another way. Let\u2019s not talk about what might happen if this or that law is turned around. Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s happening now.\n\nAbortion-access advocates and critics can\u2019t agree on why the national abortion rate has fallen; while it\u2019s true that opponents have been chipping away at access, rates of abortion are dropping faster than the rate at which opponents have succeeded in closing clinics. What\u2019s undeniable is that when abortions are uncommon and mostly done quietly and quickly and very early in a pregnancy, the side that wants to talk about abortions\u2014abortions, not \u201creproductive rights\u201d or \u201cwomen\u2019s health\u201d\u2014will get to control the public\u2019s perception of what an abortion is.\n\nSo let\u2019s try not to turn our face to the wall when Nucatola comes up, or content ourselves to talk only about pro-life activists and what their motivations are. Let\u2019s not squirm. Let\u2019s talk about abortion, what it is, what it entails, and what the stakes are for women if the anti-choice side is allowed to use disgust to define \u201cpro-choice\u201d out of existence.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:18.639+0000"}

It blocks every pathway for Iran to get a bomb, and it gives us better tools for verification and inspection and to compel rigorous compliance,\u201d the 2016 Democratic hopeful argued.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the Capitol, the push to block the deal was quickly losing steam as House Republicans struggled to find the cohesiveness and support needed to advance a resolution rejecting the Iran deal.\n\nThe House was expected to begin the process of considering a resolution to reject the White House deal, but conservatives in the House revolted, arguing that the Obama administration had not produced \u201csecret deals\u201d made between the International Atomic Energy Agency and Iran.\n\nIn the Senate, the effort to block the Iran deal also looked stuck. Soft support for the measure meant that Democratic allies of President Obama could feasibly filibuster it, preventing a vote on the matter. In order to overcome procedural hurdles in the Senate, 60 senators must vote to advance debate, and it is in doubt whether opponents of the Iran deal have the numbers.\n\n\u201cThe Senate appears stuck and House GOP members are fired up about the secret IAEA side deals.

I haven\u2019t seen it in person, but a quick perusal of Google Images confirms the BMO Harris Bradley Center looks like it was built as an homage to maximum-security prisons.\n\nSo the Bucks are getting a new arena, thanks to a deal the state\u2019s legislature recently approved. And Governor Scott Walker has committed to signing it\u2014a move that has the potential to raise questions on the campaign trail, both because of who the deal directly benefits (a major Hillary Clinton donor) and what it costs taxpayers (at least a cool $250 million ).\n\nWalker has consistently defended the deal, arguing that it\u2019s a net gain for taxpayers because it will protect revenues that would have been lost had the team left for another state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s critical not only for those who love sports, but the main reason I got into it was because it protected state revenues,\u201d Walker said, per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel . \u201cThat just creates a big hole for everything else...This was really about protecting the taxpayers of the state.\u201d Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for his office, emailed that taxpayers will get $3 in income tax revenue for every dollar the state spends.\n\nBut fiscal conservatives loathe the project, and feel it undermines Walker\u2019s cost-cutting, debt-slashing, big-government-special-interest-upstanding-to bona fides. \u201cGovernment shouldn\u2019t be in the business of financing private sports stadiums,\u201d a former director of the Wisconsin chapter of the Walker-supporting and Koch Brothers-backed Americans for Prosperity told Time magazine last month .\n\nFormer Heritage Institute economist Ronald Utt told The Daily Beast he found Walker\u2019s support for the taxpayer-funded stadium \u201cbizarre\u201d and out of character for the governor. And Nick Novak, a spokesman for the Madison-based conservative MacIver Institute think tank, which typically supports Walker\u2019s policies, said the deal \u201cprobably is not a win for taxpayers,\u201d especially when you factor in interest payments that could balloon the original costs.\n\n\u201cThis is going to cost over $400 million in taxpayer investments, and they\u2019re going to see very little of that money coming back to them,\u201d he said.\n\nSo there\u2019s some debate as to whether the deal will benefit taxpayers. But there\u2019s little question as to who it will benefit: the Bucks\u2019s two owners, one of whom is an avid Hillary Clinton supporter.\n\nMarc Lasry, a co-owner of the Bucks, is no buddy of Walker\u2019s. Just months after he and another hedge fund billionaire bought the team from former Democratic Senator Herb Kohl, Lasry greeted President Obama at the airport when he arrived in Wisconsin to campaign for the governor\u2019s Democratic challenger in 2014. According to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , Lasry held a $40,000-per-person event at his home for the president a few months before the 2012 election, and his son is \u201ca former White House aide.\u201d\n\nLasry\u2019s political connections even made Wisconsin\u2019s Republican speaker of the house, Robin Vos, a little worried about the fate of the arena deal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tough sell when you're asking for millions of dollars,\u201d he said last fall.\n\nIn the end, the hard sell got sold. With Lasry, his co-owner, and Kohl pledging to pick up the other half of the estimated $500 million tab, the Bucks are just a Scott Walker signature away from a new arena that (maybe) won\u2019t look like a metal turd. But now Lasry\u2019s close relationship with Hillary could spell another round of trouble for Walker. After Clinton announced her presidential bid in April, Lasry, who has been unequivocal in his support for the likely Democratic nominee, told Bloomberg Politics that he was looking raise $270,000 for her campaign in its first week.\n\nLasry\u2019s firm, Avenue Capital Group, also gave Clinton a round-trip ride in their plane during her 2006 New York Senate reelection campaign for a mere $408, per Bloomberg . And, according to The New York Times , the firm also gave Chelsea Clinton one of her first jobs.\n\n\u201cThis is going to cost over $400 million in taxpayer investments, and they\u2019re going to see very little of that money coming back to them.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just in the family. Jennifer Palmieri, Hillary for America\u2019s communications director, crashed at Lasry\u2019s Manhattan pad for a few nights as the Clinton campaign was coming together.\n\n\u201cWe have five children, so we are used to having a lot of people around, and we\u2019re happy to put up folks from the campaign,\u201d Lasry told The New York Times.\n\nGiven Walker\u2019s current standing in national polls\u2014 which thus far has largely evaded the drubbing other conservative candidates have taken from Trumpapalooza\u2014it remains to be seen if Republican primary state voters will get incensed about a massive taxpayer-funded deal from which a Clinton-loving billionaire stands to benefit.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s perhaps important to emphasize how ugly the Bucks current arena truly is. \u201cIt looks like the fucking architect realized last minute there were no fucking windows in his original design, so he decided to compensate by fucking gluing a smaller building to it that is only windows,\u201d a Reddit user called UncleStosh said, accurately, in a popular post begging Dwight Howard to play for the team.\n\n\u201cWE COULD LITERALLY PAINT A MURAL TO YOU ON 90% OF THE BUILDING,\u201d UncleStosh continued. \u201cLITERALLY.

And despite the fact that there are no cases in Indiana courts of business owners declining to serve gay customers, and no rampant discrimination against gay citizens by Indiana\u2019s private restaurants whatsoever, that didn\u2019t stop reporters from hunting down small business owners to pose the hypothetical: would you cater a gay wedding?\n\nMemories Pizza, a small pizza joint outside South Bend, IN, made the mistake of being honest with a reporter and unleashed a firestorm.\n\nThe restaurant, which had never actually declined to serve an actual customer on the basis of sexual orientation, and, crucially, said they would never decline to serve a customer who entered their store on such a basis, did admit that if they were ever asked to participate in a same-sex wedding as caterer, they would decline to do so on the basis of their religious beliefs.\n\nCue chaos.\n\nHeadline after headline declared Memories Pizza to be discriminatory, and it wasn\u2019t long before the store was closed down amidst threats and protests.\n\nWhen the question moves further from generally providing service to all and into the more narrow questions about marriage ceremonies, requirements, and punishments, public opinion swings even further into Memories Pizza\u2019s court.\n\nBut is Memories Pizza\u2019s position\u2014that people should be served in a restaurant regardless of their sexual orientation, but that a business owner should not be required to participate in a ceremony to which they object\u2014actually that far outside the mainstream? The polling suggests it isn\u2019t.\n\nThere are countless ways to ask survey respondents how they feel about the issue, and a review of the existing polling shows just how important the question wording is in determining how people feel.\n\nLast year, the Public Religion Research Institute asked Americans if they felt religious liberty was being threatened in America today, and a majority (54 percent) said they felt it was. Nonetheless, 80 percent of their respondents said that a business owner should not be able \u201cbe able to refuse services on religious grounds to individuals who happen to be gay or lesbian.\u201d\n\nPew Research Center found something that, at first glance, seems very different. Asking instead if a wedding services business should be \u201callowed to refuse\u201d or \u201crequired to provide\u201d services at a same-sex marriage, voters are far more split, with only 49 percent saying the business should be \u201crequired to provide.\u201d\n\nThe distinction in question wording is two-fold. The first question is about discrimination in the provision of services generally, while the second question more narrowly focuses on wedding services, which are far more obviously linked to religion than the mere act of serving up a slice of pepperoni. Second, the Pew question notes that the business owner would be \u201crequired to provide\u201d services, introducing the idea that the business owner would be compelled to do something they presumably don\u2019t want to.\n\nWhen the question moves further from generally providing service to all and into the more narrow questions about marriage ceremonies, requirements, and punishments, public opinion swings even further into Memories Pizza\u2019s court. Take another poll, conducted by Marist just a few weeks ago, which showed 65 percent of respondents opposing fines for wedding vendors who decline to provide services. This may seem like splitting hairs to some, but is actually illustrative of the way that many Americans look at the issue.\n\nThe gay rights movement has had enormous success in recent years. The tide of public opinion around marriage equality has shifted dramatically. It is incredible to think that, even just a few years ago, major Democratic luminaries like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton publicly opposed marriage equality. The seismic shifts in opinion around gay rights have been extraordinary.\n\nIndeed, the vast majority of Americans believe that discrimination against gays and lesbians is wrong. However, a huge number think that when it comes specifically to weddings and the imposition of potential punishments for religious business owners, there ought to be exceptions.\n\nOpponents of Indiana\u2019s RFRA say that public opinion is clearly on their side, but a look at the vastly divergent polling on the issue indicates that the tiny pizza joint at the heart of the controversy may not be as far outside the mainstream as people think.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:20.165+0000"}

What lies behind their beef?\n\nDonald Trump offered up a cornucopia of asinine remarks last night during the first GOP debate that even Bill Clinton could not have dreamed up when he urged the man whose most endearing characteristic is his horribly coiffed comb-over to run for the highest office in our country.\n\nBut perhaps one of the foulest and most unprofessional strings of words to leave his lips was a quick jab at comedian Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\n\nFox News anchor Megyn Kelly rightly pointed out that The Donald has a history of calling women abominable names\u2014such as \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals,\u201d which should make any person who respects women immediately exclude him as a presidential contender.\n\n\u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell,\u201d Trump said to quickly interrupt Kelly\u2014another manifestation of his respect for women, or more appropriately, lack thereof.\n\nHours later, he tweeted that Kelly was a \u201cbimbo\u201d for daring to question him on his sexism.\n\nIt\u2019s almost as if Trump doesn\u2019t realize that people with vaginas also have the right to vote.\n\nWhile the audience disturbingly lapped up Trump\u2019s O\u2019Donnell jab, the former talk-show host responded with restraint and ambiguity. Thus far, she\u2019s only tweeted \u201ctry explaining that 2 ur kids.\u201d\n\nThe latest flare-up is a relatively small ripple in the river of bad blood between her and Trump.\n\nThe two staples of early 21st-century network television have been going toe-to-toe for nearly a decade.\n\nIn 2006, O\u2019Donnell criticized Trump for failing to fire that year\u2019s Miss USA, Tara Conner.\n\nReports of her drunkenness, drug abuse, and hard partying were New York tabloid gold at the time, but have mostly faded in the gilded trash.\n\nAt the time, though, the New York Post charmingly referred to the then-21-year-old pageant queen as \u201cdrug-snorting\u201d and \u201cman-eating.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Donnell compared Trump to the \"snake-oil salesman on Little House On The Prairie.\u201d\n\nShe also skewered his past, calling him out because he \u201cleft the first wife\u2014had an affair. [He] had kids both times, but he\u2019s the moral compass for 20-year-olds in America. Donald, sit and spin, my friend.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably the Trump stuff was the most bullying I ever experienced in my life, including as a child.\u201d\n\nFor a hothead fool like Trump, those words were like waving red at a bull in a china shop.\n\n\u201cRosie will rue the words she said. I\u2019ll most likely sue her for making those false statements\u2014and it\u2019ll be fun,\u201d he told People. \u201cRosie\u2019s a loser. A real loser. I look forward to taking lots of money from my nice fat little Rosie.\u201d\n\nTrump took things a step further when O\u2019Donnell refused to back down.\n\nThe fame-monger milked the feud for all it was worth, calling O\u2019Donnell a \u201cvery, very unattractive woman,\u201d a \u201cslob,\u201d and insinuating that her ire toward Miss USA was a result of unrequited love for Conner.\n\n\u201cMaybe she wanted to put the crown back on Miss USA\u2019s head. I think she\u2019s very attracted to Miss USA so she probably wanted to put the crown on her head herself,\u201d Trump told Good Day L.A.\n\nTrump\u2019s insults at O\u2019Donnell were beyond repugnant. They\u2019re more than lightly tinged with homophobia and sexism.\n\nO\u2019Donnell is hardly a softie. It\u2019s worth noting that O\u2019Donnell has racked up nearly as many enemies as Trump. She had countless spats with nearly every woman she worked with on The View, and appeared to pick a fight with Kelly Ripa.\n\nIn 2006, O\u2019Donnell accused Ripa of being homophobic when Clay Aiken (who had not yet come out publicly) put his hand over her mouth and she said \u201cOh, that\u2019s a no-no. I don\u2019t know where that hand\u2019s been, honey!\u201d\n\nAnd then came her big blow-up with the right wing Elisabeth Hasselbeck over the Iraq War, which led to O\u2019Donnell leaving The View, and remains one of the daytime\u2019s show most memorable moments.\n\nTrump\u2019s comments appear to have left a lasting mark on the bombastic comedienne.\n\nWhen O\u2019Donnell spoke in 2014 about her noticeable weight loss, she brought up how hurt she was by Trump\u2019s attacks. \u201cProbably the Trump stuff was the most bullying I ever experienced in my life, including as a child,\u201d O\u2019Donnell told People. \u201cIt was national, and it was sanctioned societally. Whether I deserved it is up to your own interpretation.\u201d\n\nIn response to O\u2019Donnell\u2019s open discussion of the spat, Trump so maturely tweeted in July 2014: \u201cRosie is crude, rude, obnoxious and dumb\u2014other than that I like her very much!\u201d\n\nHe followed up a few months later in September by tweeting a Daily Mail article recapping their spat with the text, \u201cNo offense, and good luck on the new show, but remember, you started it!\u201d\n\nTo be fair to Trump, not all of his comments to O\u2019Donnell have been negative. He even tweeted at her in 2012 to \u201cget better fast. I\u2019m starting to miss you!\u201d after she suffered a heart attack.\n\nO\u2019Donnell hasn\u2019t exactly remained silent during these Twitter flair-ups, either. She has no problem calling him \u201can ass\u2026 in every way\u201d on Twitter, while linking to a Time.com article that catalogued his financial failures.\n\nNeither Trump nor O\u2019Donnell looks like anything more than a petulant child with too much social media swagger when all is said and done.\n\nStill, looking back at the war of words and Trump\u2019s disgusting display last night, one can\u2019t help but wish the White House contender had taken O\u2019Donnell\u2019s advice at least once in May 2014 when she simply tweeted: \u201cDonald\u2014go away.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:20.455+0000"}

But then Kennedy snubbed Ol\u2019 Blue Eyes over his mob ties and Sinatra ended up turning Republican.\n\nSinatra: All or Nothing at All, Alex Gibney\u2019s four-hour, two-part documentary wrapping up Monday night on HBO, delves into Frank Sinatra\u2019s life, passions, and musical and movie career.\n\nThe film also touches on his role as a major-league political fundraiser and serious campaigner. Despite brushing off early fears he could hurt his singing career with his politics, he later ended up becoming a political liability for two presidents.\n\nSinatra\u2019s mother, Dolly, was active in Democratic politics in Hoboken, New Jersey, when he was growing up, and her influence on him was clear. He would go on to campaign across the country for Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Adlai Stevenson. \u201c[President Roosevelt is] the greatest guy alive today, and here\u2019s this little guy from Hoboken shaking his hand,\u201d Sinatra noted after the president invited him over to the White House for tea. On the campaign trail, Sinatra sang songs and delivered speeches for FDR.\n\n\u201cSome people tell me I may hurt my career by taking sides in a political campaign,\u201d he told a crowd of Roosevelt-Truman supporters at Madison Square Garden a few days before the 1944 election. \u201cAnd I say to them, \u2018To hell with this career. Government is more important.\u2019\u201d\n\nEleanor Roosevelt and Frank Sinatra. (Newscom)\n\nBut the politician who Sinatra ended up idolizing most fervently was, without a doubt, John F. Kennedy. Both men were handsome, magnetic forces. Both were avid partiers and womanizers, and they shared similar takes on liberal politics. It didn\u2019t take long for the pair to strike up a friendship. Here\u2019s footage of Kennedy visiting the set of the original, Rat Pack-starring Ocean\u2019s 11 Las Vegas:\n\n\u201cHis love for Kennedy was so strong,\u201d Nancy Sinatra wrote of her father. \u201cJFK was his friend. For the patriotic American dreamer, this was the ultimate compliment: The President of the United States was his friend.\u201d\n\nDuring the 1960 presidential campaign, Sinatra was an effective fundraiser and campaigner for JFK, and he went on to produce and star in the Inaugural Gala.\n\n\u201cThe main thing to know about Sinatra, and the reason he campaigned so hard for Jack Kennedy, is that Sinatra was addicted to power,\u201d author James Kaplan\u2014the second volume of whose Sinatra biography, Sinatra: The Chairman, is set for release in October\u2014told The Daily Beast. \u201cAnd Washington power was an especially heady version of the power he was addicted to. There\u2019s something about Washington and being connected to leaders of the Western world that very much appealed to him.\u201d\n\nAlthough Sinatra committed decades to liberal causes and the Democratic Party, the remainder of the \u201960s laid the groundwork for his defection to the Republican Party and his later status as a full-blown celebrity Reaganite.\n\n\u201cFor Sinatra, it wasn\u2019t like the other Reagan Democrats,\u201d Kaplan said. \u201cIt had a particularly Sinatra-esque tinge to it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s something about Washington and being connected to leaders of the Western world that very much appealed to him.\u201d\n\nIn the spring of 1962, President Kennedy had planned on staying the weekend at Sinatra\u2019s Palm Springs residence. Sinatra had spent a lot of time and money renovating his home to make it look more presidential. But shortly before the visit, Kennedy\u2019s brother Bobby intervened: Sinatra\u2019s ties to, and friendly relationships with, mob bosses such as Sam Giancana were too much of a political liability. So the president stayed at rival singer Bing Crosby\u2019s place instead.\n\nThe snub absolutely infuriated Sinatra, who reportedly picked up a sledgehammer upon hearing the bad news and started destroying the heliport he had installed for the president\u2019s big arrival. \u201cThe fuse for Sinatra\u2019s nitroglycerine was always humiliation [and] losing face,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nAfter he failed to strike up anything close to a rapport with Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey and President Lyndon Johnson, Sinatra\u2019s drift to the right gained more momentum. In 1970, he made the surprise announcement that he was backing Ronald Reagan for governor of California. (Sinatra had previously been consistently vocal about his disdain for both Ronald and Nancy Reagan.) Sinatra even warmed up to the Nixon White House.\n\n\u201cI think that 1970 was such a heavy year, with the Kent State killings, all the protests on college campuses\u2014Sinatra was really freaked out with all the disorder in the country, and that helped push him to the right,\u201d Kaplan said.\n\nSinatra and Reagan grew chummy enough that Reagan roasted the singer on The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast in 1978, just a couple years before his successful presidential run.\n\n\u201cFrank Sinatra would make a president who is strong on defense, but again, will have concern for humanity,\u201d Reagan joked. \u201cScientists at his urging have developed an intercontinental ballistics missile that is not a weapon of mass destruction. It only hits photographers.\u201d\n\nAnd when the Reagan era\u2014and the conservative revival that came with it\u2014kicked into full swing, Sinatra once again had a dear friend in the Oval Office. \u201cThe liberal approach didn\u2019t work as well as it should have, and I think maybe a lot of us have moved away from it,\u201d Sinatra said, after explaining he was a \u201cvery big\u201d fan of his \u201cold friend\u201d Ronald Reagan, at the 1980 Republican National Convention.\n\nShortly after Reagan defeated Carter, the president-elect announced that Sinatra had been chosen as director of entertainment for the Inaugural Gala for the first time since Kennedy\u2019s inaugural celebration. Throughout the Reagan years, Sinatra remained a reliable supporter and Republican fundraiser. (He also became something of a political liability to Reagan, as well, albeit to a much lesser extent than with Kennedy, though the subject matter should seem familiar.)\n\nThroughout Sinatra\u2019s political evolution, he was consistently unapologetic and ardent in his approach. Even when he wasn\u2019t trying to do so, he could affect the calculations of major political figures\u2014even those outside the United States. In late 1989, as the Cold War was winding down, the Soviet Union\u2019s spin doctors were, apparently, attempting to appeal to Western culture and sensibilities. A top Foreign Ministry spokesman announced that the Kremlin had started operating under what it termed the \u201dFrank Sinatra Doctrine\u201d in Eastern Europe\u2014meaning the USSR would allow the Soviet republics to do things \u201ctheir way\u201d as the empire dissolved.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:21.068+0000"}

But some home state conservatives find a few of his talking points a little funny, given the extent to which the state\u2019s conservative legislature pushed him to the right and kept him there.\n\nWalker \u201916 has been a very long time coming, but in many ways, the delay was by design.\n\nHe promised he wouldn\u2019t start running for president until his state\u2019s budget passed\u2014but that hairy process took about a month longer than expected.\n\nAnd while some conservatives argue it took so long because of Walker\u2019s shadow presidential campaign\u2014they also took advantage of his absence.\n\nWhen Walker released the state\u2019s budget proposal in February, many conservative Wisconsinites had heart palpitations.\n\nIt included a big handout for a Hillary-Clinton-loving billionaire in the form of funds to build an arena for the Milwaukee Bucks, as well as a high level of borrowing to pay for transportation projects.\n\nConservatives in the state tell The Daily Beast that this left many of them scratching their heads.\n\nWhere were all the big, bold reforms Walker frequently touts to bring Iowa crowds to their feet? After all, the 2014 elections gave Assembly Republicans the biggest majority they\u2019d had in that chamber since the Eisenhower administration. And Walker wanted to follow that election up with\u2014this?\n\nThus began several WWE-esque smackdowns in the legislature.\n\nAnd when the dust settled, the final budget had some significant differences from the proposal Walker first sent to the Capitol.\n\nRepublicans dramatically lowered the level of transportation borrowing, and added a provision eliminating the rule requiring that Wisconsin municipalities pay the \u201cprevailing wage\u201d to workers hired for their projects.\n\nSykes said credit for that particular change\u2014which he would place squarely in the \u201cbig, bold reform\u201d category\u2014did not go to Walker.\n\n\u201cDaddy was gone, the grown-up was gone. Walker had been setting the agenda and suddenly he was out of the picture...It was sort of every man for himself.\u201d\n\nInstead, the victory went to three state senators: Duey Stroebel, Stephen Nass, and Frank Lasee, who refused to vote for the budget unless it did more for the right.\n\nRepublicans\u2019 majority in the Senate is small enough that groups of just three legislators can hold enormous sway, and Sykes says they did so quite successfully in this case.\n\nThat\u2019s not to suggest Walker\u2019s proposal didn\u2019t have a lot for them to like, including a school choice expansion and no new or raised taxes. Under Walker\u2019s watch, the state\u2019s property tax level has been stubbornly frozen, and conservatives love him for it.\n\nBut conservative legislators are used to dreaming big, and Walker\u2019s initial proposal wasn\u2019t going to cut it.\n\n\u201cThere was very clearly a leadership vacuum,\u201d said Collin Roth, the managing editor of Right Wisconsin, pointing to Walker\u2019s pre-presidential travel schedule as the source of said vacuum.\n\nSykes concurred.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s had quite a travel schedule,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, after all that, conservatives seem to mostly agree that the final budget will be a boon for the governor\u2019s presidential ambitions\u2014and that it will be good for the state.\n\nWalker\u2019s office said they\u2019re proud of the final product.\n\n\u201cWe have worked closely with lawmakers throughout the process and will sign into law a budget that best serves Wisconsin\u2019s citizens and continues to move Wisconsin forward,\u201d said Laurel Patrick, a spokeswoman for the governor.\n\nOther top Badger State conservatives are also happy with the outcome.\n\n\u201cThe legislature did good work when it comes to the transportation bonding levels,\u201d said Brett Healy, the president of the conservative think tank MacIver Institute. \u201cBut I just don\u2019t know how you can look at Governor Walker\u2019s record and somehow question that he\u2019s a true fiscal conservative.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s governorship certainly hasn\u2019t been dominated by his legislature\u2014the 20-week abortion ban on his desk was all his doing\u2014but he was initially coy about some of the initiatives that he will likely celebrate on the campaign trail.\n\nTake the legislation making Wisconsin a Right-to-Work state, which means employers can\u2019t make payment of union dues a condition of employment.\n\nWalker\u2019s senior adviser, Rick Wiley, listed that policy change as an example of a time when Walker \u201cbested\u201d President Obama.\n\nBut home state conservatives roll their eyes a little bit at that.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very amusing,\u201d said Roth. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to look far in media quotes going back to November, December, January\u2014he did not want that bill to get to his desk.\u201d\n\nWalker\u2019s team says he hasn\u2019t vacillated in his support for Right to Work legislation, and has only expressed concerns about timing.

{"entityId": 1917, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "On Thursday in Manhattan, the vice president looked back at the long battle\u2014and what\u2019s next. But what really made this win inevitable was when love became the essence of marriage.\n\nIn a way, Jane Austen won the right to same-sex marriage.\n\nNot Austen specifically, of course\u2014though Mr. Darcy has been the object of much gay and straight adoration\u2014but the centuries-long movement of which she is a part: the humanistic, romantic idea that love should conquer law.\n\nSuch was my impression at Thursday night\u2019s marriage equality victory lap at the swanky Cipriani New York, put on by the advocacy organization Freedom to Marry and its founder/guru, Evan Wolfson. He\u2019s the man who, more than any other individual, including Jane Austen, deserves the most credit for winning national marriage equality.\n\nAs Vice President Joe Biden, Wolfson, and others recognized, there were many, many factors that caused marriage equality to become the law of the land on June 26, 2015. But as Biden said, in a way, at the core of the movement has been a very straightforward proposition. Recalling a time when he and his father saw two men kissing, Biden said Thursday: \u201cI looked at my Dad, and he said, \u2018they love each other\u2014it\u2019s simple.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, as Biden quickly added, the long march to marriage equality hasn\u2019t been that simple. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed, millions of philanthropic dollars spent, and a myriad of cultural moments marked, from La Cage Aux Folles to Ellen DeGeneres. \u201cThis is the civil rights issue of our generation,\u201d Biden told the cheering crowd. \u201cAnd what you have accomplished didn\u2019t just take moral courage. It took physical courage.\u201d\n\n\n\nThat, too, is true. Recall ACT-UP activists demanding that an uncharacteristically speechless Ronald Reagan utter the word \u201cAIDS.\u201d (It took him until September 1985, at which point 12,000 people had died.) Remember also the original transgender rioters at Stonewall and the first gay rights protest in front of the White House, in 1957, when 10 people risked their livelihoods to demand legal equality.\n\nBut what won the day, in the end, was neither constitutional legal theory nor radical societal change. It was clear at Cipriani that what won the day was\u2014trigger alert, cynics\u2014love.\n\nConsider this version of the story. The arguments against same-sex marriage are many, but the majority of them insist it isn\u2019t really marriage at all but something lesser. This isn\u2019t love, it\u2019s lust, like bestiality or incest. (\u201cMan on dog,\u201d in Rick Santorum\u2019s epitaph-worthy phrase.) Homosexuals were said to be perverts, psychological deviants, or sex fiends.\n\nOnly, gradually, it became clear that they aren\u2019t\u2014at least, not in significantly greater number than heterosexuals.\n\nIn fact, as people got to know gays and lesbians, either personally or through the media, it turned out that most, though not all, were actually a little dull. They wanted love, equal rights, basic dignity. They wanted to live and let live.\n\nAs people got to know gays and lesbians, it turned out that most were actually a little dull. They wanted love, equal rights, basic dignity. They wanted to live and let live.\n\n(This outraged the non-dull gays, the radicals who wanted a movement of sexual liberation, but they turned out to be in the minority.)\n\nEventually, the arguments against gay marriage started to seem either mean, or abstract, or both. Sure, the Bible seems to say bad things about lascivious homosexual behavior, but that\u2019s not what Aunt Nancy and Aunt Lisa have, right?\n\nAnd no one really took those abstractions about \u201cgender complementarity\u201d and procreation too seriously. They seemed like rationales for prejudice. How can you compare some philosophical argument with Jim Obergefell, flying his dying partner out of state so they could get married, only to have the marriage ignored by his home state of Ohio? Or with Edie Windsor?\n\nWhich is where Jane Austen comes in. If love really does conquer all\u2014even if, in Austen, Shakespeare, and others, the lovers pay a serious price\u2014then surely it conquers some abstract bloviating about the Bible. (Of course, it also didn\u2019t help that so many anti-gay pastors and politicians turned out to be closeted gays and so many priests turned out to be child molesters.)\n\nAnd if marriage, again following Austen, is primarily about love, then how can it be denied to two consenting adults who are obviously, manifestly, in love?\n\nI was personally involved in the marriage struggle\u2014as a full-time activist, but playing a very bit part\u2014from around 2008 to 2013. And I heard this firsthand from religious people, time and time again: \u201cI used to believe it was wrong, but then my [daughter][friend][uncle] came out, and I had to think again.\u201d\n\nI came to see victory as inexorable because there really was a truth of the matter, and it really was on our side. Our opponents were lying about our lives. If we just told the truth, we wouldn\u2019t win over everyone, but we\u2019d win over enough.\n\nEasy to say in 2015. But in 1983, when Evan Wolfson wrote his quixotic law review article arguing for a constitutional right to same-sex marriage, everyone thought he was crazy. As late as the 1990s, I myself thought marriage was the wrong battle to fight\u2014too contentious, too soaked in the language of religion.\n\nWe were all wrong, and Wolfson was right.\n\nReally, it was a two-pronged battle. The first prong was the set of cultural changes I\u2019ve talked about already. The second was, indeed, a matter of law, and canny political strategy. Wolfson went state by state, winning some battles in the courts and a few in the legislature. He focused exclusively on marriage, building coalitions with willing conservatives\u2014alienating many progressives in the process\u2014and putting aside differences on other issues. He convinced several large LGBT organizations, each with their own interests, to coordinate their efforts.\n\nAnd he made crucial legal arguments.\n\nOn Thursday in Biden\u2019s remarks, which seemed to be largely off the cuff, he pointed out that in the 1987 confirmation hearings of Robert Bork, he and the would-be Supreme Court justice had a passionate disagreement about the nature of constitutional rights. Bork, an originalist like Antonin Scalia, said the only rights guaranteed by the Constitution are those written in the Constitution. (Scalia said the same thing in his Obergefell dissent.)\n\nBiden disagreed. Citing Wolfson\u2019s law review article, he said human rights are given by God and that the Constitution merely guarantees that they cannot be taken away. Exactly what those rights are\u2014what \u201cequal protection of the laws\u201d means, for example\u2014is subject to the evolution of moral and legal reasoning. Not judicial fiat, as the Obergefell dissenters charged, but argumentation, reason, and reflection on the ambit of human rights.\n\nFor decades after the Fourteenth Amendment was passed, Jim Crow laws oppressed those the amendment was specifically designed to protect. Were those laws really constitutional, simply because they weren\u2019t enumerated in the text of the Constitution or were present when it passed? Surely not. Surely, even if \u201cequal protection\u201d and \u201cdue process\u201d meant one thing in 1868, they encompassed these later developments, as well.\n\nWell, Biden won the battle, and Bork lost. And as the vice president pointed out, the man Reagan nominated in his place was Anthony Kennedy, the deciding vote in Obergefell and the author of all four major Supreme Court opinions on LGBT equality.\n\nA cynic would say Biden just took even more credit for marriage equality\u2014on top of the credit he already gets (and deserves) for beating his boss to the punch and saying in May 2012 that he believed that all couples, gay or straight, should be able to legally marry.\n\nBut Biden also noted that legal philosophy was never the driving force in the struggle. \u201cThe country has always been ahead of the court,\u201d he said. And he generously shared credit with the ballroom full of activists, donors, and ordinary citizens, many of whom had been fighting this battle for 30 years, well before it seemed inevitable to Johnny-Come-Latelys like me.\n\nBiden insisted on looking forward to the next battle: anti-discrimination protection. \u201cThere are 32 states where you can get married in the morning and get fired in the afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWe most expose the darkness to justice.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, the reception was a kind of victory lap\u2014combined with a retirement party for Freedom to Marry, which is admirably closing its doors, having accomplished its mission. The sponsor-provided vodka flowed freely, and Carly Rae Jepsen entertained the crowd.\n\nI\u2019m a pretty cynical guy, but I was honored to be among them.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:22.706+0000"}

And there\u2019s no sign of letup in \u201916.\n\nBy Robert Faturechi and Jonathan Stray, ProPublica\n\n\n\nThe wealthiest Americans can fly on their own jets, live in gated compounds and watch movies in their own theaters.\n\nMore of them also are walling off their political contributions from other big and small players.\n\nA growing number of political committees known as super PACs have become instruments of single donors, according to a ProPublica analysis of federal records. During the 2014 election cycle, $113 million\u201416 percent of money raised by all super PACs\u2014went to committees dominated by one donor. That was quadruple their 2012 share.\n\nThe rise of single-donor groups is a new example of how changes in campaign finance law are giving outsized influence to a handful of funders.\n\nThe trend may continue into 2016. National Review recently reported that Texas Senator Ted Cruz\u2019s bid for the Republican presidential nomination would be boosted not by one anointed super PAC but four, each controlled by a single donor or donor family.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United ruling helped usher in the era of super PACs. Unlike traditional political action committees, the independent groups can accept donations of any dollar size as long as they don\u2019t coordinate with the campaign of any candidate.\n\nPreviously, much of the focus in big-money fundraising was on \u201cbundlers\u201d\u2014volunteers who tap friends and associates for maximum individual contributions of $5,400 to a candidate, then deliver big lump sums directly to the campaigns. Former president George W. Bush awarded his most prolific bundlers special titles such as \u201cRanger\u201d and \u201cPioneer.\u201d\n\nWhile bundling intensified the impact of wealthy donors on campaigns, the dollar limits and the need to join with others diluted the influence of any one person. With a super PAC, a donor can single-handedly push a narrower agenda. Last year, National Journal profiled one such donor\u2014a California vineyard owner who helped start the trend by launching his own super PAC and becoming a power player in a Senate race across the country.\n\n\u201cWe are anointing an aristocracy that\u2019s getting a stronger and stronger grip on democracy.\u201d\n\nBeyond the single-donor groups, big donations are dominant across all kinds of super PACs, according to the analysis. Six-figure contributions from individuals or organizations accounted for almost 50 percent of all super PAC money raised during the last two cycles.\n\n\u201cWe are anointing an aristocracy that\u2019s getting a stronger and stronger grip on democracy,\u201d said Miles Rapoport, president of Common Cause, an advocacy group that seeks to reduce the influence of money on politics.\n\nProPublica\u2019s analysis identified 59 super PACs that received at least 80 percent of their funding from one individual during the 2014 cycle. They raised a total of $113 million, compared with the $33 million raised by the 34 such groups that existed in 2012.\n\nDonors who launch their own PACs are seeking more control over how their money is spent. And many have complained about the commissions that fundraising consultants take off the top of their donations to outside groups. But the move carries risks if the patron is new to the arena.\n\nIn one cautionary tale, a reclusive 89-year-old Texas oilman with no political experience launched Vote2ReduceDebt, one of the nation\u2019s highest-spending conservative super PACs. A ProPublica investigation found that much of the donor\u2019s millions went to entities run by the group\u2019s consultants or their close associates. The super PAC imploded as principals traded allegations including self-dealing, faked campaign events and a plot to siphon the PAC\u2019s money to a reality TV show.\n\nBill Burton, a former Obama administration official who helped found Priorities USA, the juggernaut super PAC affiliated with the president\u2019s reelection campaign, said he expects donors to face more problems if they continue to go it alone.\n\n\u201cOne of two things is going to happen,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will either see widespread flaunting of coordination rules or we will see some pretty spectacular failures to the tune of millions of dollars.\u201d\n\nThe single-donor super PACs identified by ProPublica span the political spectrum. Among the top conservative donors were Richard Uihlein, a packaging supplies businessman, and casino magnate Sheldon Adelson. Former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg spent heavily on both sides but leaned Democrat. Hedge fund titan Tom Steyer dominated on the left.\n\nIn 2012 the largest single-donor super PAC was former TD Ameritrade CEO Joe Ricketts\u2019 Ending Spending Action Fund, which raised over $14 million, 89 percent of which came from Ricketts. It was the ninth-largest super PAC by spending. In 2014 Steyer\u2019s Nextgen Climate Action was the largest super PAC, raising almost $78 million, 85 percent from Steyer. (Steyer\u2019s wife, Kat Taylor, is a member of ProPublica\u2019s board of directors, and the couple has donated to ProPublica.)\n\nIn addition to the super PACs dominated by a single individual, dozens more received the great majority of their funding from one corporation, labor group or advocacy organization. In 2014, those PACs represented 8.6 percent of super-PAC fundraising.\n\nPACs dominated by one donor could run afoul of disclosure laws, according to Larry Noble, the former top lawyer for the Federal Election Commission. Under the rules, political ads must include disclosures about who funded them. Noble said election law would require groups funded by one person to list that donor\u2019s name, not just the name of the PAC\u2014though he couldn\u2019t recall the FEC addressing such a case.\n\nNaming the super PAC instead of the donor in the ad, Noble said, also allows the groups to delay disclosing where their money comes from until the next FEC filing date\u2014potentially weeks after the ad runs.\n\n\u201cIt defeats the purpose of the law to allow someone to hide behind a super PAC if they are the only funder,\u201d Noble said.\n\n\u201cThey want to make it more authoritative, like there\u2019s more support. It looks better to say the ad is from Americans for Good Government than from John Smith\u2026 That just makes a mockery of the law.\u201d\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

{"entityId": 1919, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why the Catholic convert\u2019s willingness to talk theology in front of an evangelical audience is a big deal.\n\nEvangelicals aren\u2019t typically the target audience for Roman Catholic theology talk. Low-church Protestants from the Bible Belt have historically been hostile to Catholicism, even sometimes fearing that Catholics\u2019 devotion to the pope will lead to one-world government, and that their political clout in the United States presages the end times.\n\nSo it was perhaps a little surprising when Jeb Bush, who converted to his wife\u2019s Catholicism, launched into an emotional testimony before a predominantly evangelical audience on Friday about the joy he felt when he left Protestantism.\n\nCatholics and Evangelicals haven\u2019t always played well together. In 2008, Rev. John Hagee\u2014a Texas pastor and one of the country\u2019s most powerful evangelical leaders\u2014apologized to Bill Donohue of the Catholic League for intimating that the Catholic church was the \u201cgreat whore\u201d of Revelation, and for telegraphing the kind of anti-Catholic rhetoric typically associated with 19th-century nativists. (Among Southern Baptists, in particular, there\u2019s long been a flamboyantly anti-Catholic strain of thought and rhetoric.) And while conservative Catholics and evangelical Protestants are simpatico when it comes to certain public policy goals, they usually avoid public discussions about areas of theological disagreement.\n\nBut here in a ballroom in a hotel in D.C.\u2019s Woodley Park neighborhood, Bush decided that courting the country\u2019s leading social conservative activists could entail discussing one of the elements of Catholic theology that\u2019s least amenable to evangelicals\u2014namely the blessed sacraments, which include confession and communion.\n\n\u201cI converted to the Catholic Church\u2014Christ came into my life a little earlier, but I converted to being Catholic in honor of my wife and because I believe in the blessed sacraments and they give me great comfort,\u201d he said at the beginning of his speech before the Faith and Freedom Coalition. \u201cOn Easter Sabbath of 1995, I had lost an election in 1994 and found a total serenity and solace in the RCIA class, and converted to being a Catholic and it\u2019s been an organizing part of my architecture, if you will, as a person and certainly as an elected official.\u201d\n\nRCIA stands for Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, and refers to the catechesis process that would-be Catholic converts go through before entering the Church.\n\nEvangelicals, needless to say, do not see the act of leaving Protestantism as something that should necessarily be a source of \u201ctotal serenity and solace.\u201d\n\nEvangelicals, needless to say, do not see the act of leaving Protestantism as something that should necessarily be a source of \u201ctotal serenity and solace.\u201d And sometimes, as in Hagee\u2019s case, their leaders show outright hostility to those who jump ship. So Bush\u2019s willingness to talk explicitly about his decision to leave behind the Protestantism that galvanizes so many members of the Faith and Freedom Coalition audience reflects an important shift in the way social conservatives talk to each other.\n\nYes, the two groups have long been political allies\u2014the evangelical George W. Bush handily won Catholics in 2004, and the stalwart Catholic Rick Santorum was kept afloat in the 2012 GOP primary by Southern evangelicals. But increasingly, evangelical Christians and conservative Roman Catholics are finding common ground not just in their shared political concerns but also in a shared language about personal devotion to faith.\n\nAnd that shared devotion played heavily in Bush\u2019s speech, as he reiterated his support for the Little Sisters of the Poor, a group of Catholic nuns embroiled in a fight with the federal government over contraceptive coverage, and his repulsion with Hillary Clinton\u2019s comment that \u201creligious beliefs\u2026have to be changed.\u201d Clinton\u2019s camp hasn\u2019t clarified which specific religious beliefs she thinks must change, but conservatives like Bush have taken the comment as a direct attack on their pro-life convictions. Bush\u2019s criticism of Clinton\u2019s comment drew warm applause from the crowd.\n\nPenny Nance, an evangelical Christian who heads the conservative Concerned Women for America, said those comments reflect growing unity and cooperation between conservative Catholics and evangelicals.\n\n\u201cWe are more united than we have been in my lifetime, certainly,\u201d she said. \u201cCatholics and evangelicals have certainly linked arms and will continue to link arms over the issue of life and marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cJeb embracing his Catholicism is not a problem for evangelicals,\u201d she added.\n\nNance would know\u2014she wrote a Fox News op-ed in February of 2012 titled \u201c We are all Catholics now\u201d. And Patricia Miller of Salon argued in March of this year that white Catholics\u2019 increasing affinity for the GOP could become a problem for the Democratic party.\n\n\u201c[F]or the first time, white Catholics are more Republican than the voting group usually considered the ultimate Republicans: white Protestants,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIt\u2019s just one more indicator that despite a fraught history, Protestant Evangelicals and conservative Catholics have become a cohesive political unit. As the two groups become more and more closely allied on public policy issues, and as they both increasingly adopt a defensive posture in the culture wars, conservative Catholic candidates like Bush will feel more comfortable talking about their faith in more explicit ways before Evangelical audiences.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:23.629+0000"}
{"entityId": 1920, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In 1992, the Texas billionaire thrived on all the free media coverage. But then he refused to spend money. If Trump is serious about a third-party run, he\u2019ll need to shell out.\n\nThere was no social media in April 1992 when Texas billionaire Ross Perot announced his third-party candidacy on the Larry King show.\n\nBut Perot had 4 million volunteers who called his 800-number, and when Republican strategist Ed Rollins asked what he did with their information, Perot said he had it all on computer cards. Great, Rollins thought. A veteran of many campaigns, including President Reagan\u2019s, he had been brought in to professionalize Perot\u2019s grassroots campaign.\n\nFour million names was like money in the bank in those days, but Perot bristled at the idea of sending \u201cjunk mail\u201d to his prized volunteers. \u201cHe had no understanding of the game, and when he saw it, he didn\u2019t like it,\u201d Rollins recalled in a phone interview with The Daily Beast. As Perot gained strength in the polls, the media scrutiny intensified, and he told Rollins, \u201cI never got bad press until I hired you and Hamilton [Jordan].\u201d\n\nRollins told him that he was being treated like any other candidate, and in June 1992, with Perot polling at 39 percent, ahead of both President George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton, Jordan, who had been President Carter\u2019s chief of staff, exclaimed, \u201cIf we\u2019re not careful, we\u2019ll elect this guy.\u201d Rollins assured him not to worry. He had by then figured out Perot was not going to listen to any of their advice and was temperamentally unsuited to run a campaign, much less the country.\n\nStill, he got 19 percent of the vote in the November election, which was almost 20 million votes, and many analysts believe he handed the election to Clinton. Thirty-two years later, another rich Republican is off the reservation and threatening to run as a third-party candidate. And another Clinton could benefit. \u201cAs an Independent, [Donald Trump] would take a certain segment, mostly Republicans, which tilts the race to Hillary,\u201d says Rollins.\n\n\u201cPerot didn\u2019t understand advertising and PR. He didn\u2019t understand the presidency, and he had very little substance.\u201d\n\nThere are similarities between the two men in wealth and ego, and in the tightfistedness of the very rich when it comes to parting with their own money. Rollins had proposed to Perot a $150 million media campaign with Hal Riney, creator of Reagan\u2019s \u201cMorning in America\u201d ads, at the helm. Perot balked. He wasn\u2019t going to spend money on all those longhaired hippies behind the cameras when he could go on Larry King for nothing.\n\nPerot was very tight with the dollar, and a third-party bid is expensive. He wasn\u2019t willing to spend the money. Trump is much more savvy than Perot ever was. \u201cTrump is very reluctant to spend his money, but he\u2019s been through the wars, he\u2019s used to being battered around,\u201d says Rollins. \u201cPerot didn\u2019t understand advertising and PR. He didn\u2019t understand the presidency, and he had very little substance.\u201d\n\nTrump knows the game. The big question for him is how far he will take his candidacy in terms of dollars he will put on the line. \u201cNo one knows how much Trump is willing to spend,\u201d says Rollins. \u201cI think at this point he\u2019s a distraction. The potential is there for him to be a very destructive force in the party. The country is pretty disgusted with politicians, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s tapping into.\u201d\n\nTrump has so far offered very little substance on issues other than to claim he would get a better deal with China and he would get Mexico to pay for a border wall. Perot raised one important issue, the deficit, and he became a Johnny One Note on the subject. John White, a former Carter OMB and Defense Department official who was brought in to teach Perot the issues, was alarmed at how little the candidate knew and how uninterested he was in learning. Give me a one-pager on health care, he would bark, and that was it.\n\nLike Perot, Trump appears to have a very shallow understanding of what the presidency is all about, and he\u2019s not temperamentally qualified to be president.\n\nBut two billionaires three decades apart reflect and are captive to an angry electorate. Perot said some stupid things, more out of lack of knowledge, says Rollins. Trump is mean-spirited, and if he doesn\u2019t feel he\u2019s being treated fairly by the GOP, he has the club of running third party. Ballot access in all 50 states is not hard, but it\u2019s expensive. You have to hire people and they have to collect enough signatures to qualify. Americans Elect did it in 2012 on a \u201cbuild it and they will come theory,\u201d but no candidate stepped up to run.\n\nTrump is already altering the dynamics of the race. \u201cIt\u2019s his plane, it\u2019s his staff; he has all kinds of resources available to him. And there\u2019s a novelty to him,\u201d says Rollins. That novelty might wear off as it did with Perot, whose bizarre behavior became more obvious closer to the election. Whether or not Trump is in it for the duration, he\u2019s created bigger problems for his party with Hispanics. \u201cOn immigration, he\u2019s stirring up the hard core right wing of our base, so if someone like Jeb Bush says something different, he could get booed off the stage,\u201d says Rollins.\n\nRepublican pollster Frank Luntz worked with the Perot campaign, and said in an email that Trump has \u201call the advantages Perot had\u2026and one more that Perot didn\u2019t. He has the thickest skin of anyone I\u2019ve ever seen in politics. Nothing bothers him, and you need that fortitude to be a successful third-party candidate.\u201d\n\nFor those trying to gauge the seriousness of Trump\u2019s campaign, the reported involvement of pollster Pat Caddell adds to concerns that Trump could be hell bent on destroying the GOP in order to save it. Caddell was the architect of what became known as Carter\u2019s \u201cmalaise\u201d speech, and the two seem like a match made in heaven. New York magazine reports that he and Trump talk almost every night. Caddell has searched for years to find a candidate who doesn\u2019t distort his message.\n\n\u201cAll I can say is Trump makes Ross Perot look like George Washington,\u201d says Gerald Rafshoon, Carter\u2019s former media adviser, who flew to Dallas in \u201992 to meet with Perot about his ad campaign. The meeting didn\u2019t go well. Perot told Rafshoon he could get on TV any time he wanted, so why should he spend money on ads? To underscore his point, he called out to his secretary to get Larry King on the phone and book him for that evening.\n\nPerot\u2019s candidacy was born on King\u2019s CNN show and for a time thrived in that venue. Trump is a cable news creature, plus he\u2019s known from his show, The Apprentice, and his signature line, \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d How long he can keep his candidacy going depends on how long the free media continues, and how much of his own money he is willing to spend.\n\nIf Trump runs as a third-party candidate, he will have to spend money, a lot of it, and if he concludes his chances in the end are no better than Perot\u2019s of cracking the two-party lock, that may not look like a deal he\u2019ll want to make.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:23.769+0000"}

The latest obsession is to corner a Republican running for president and ask them a variation of the following: \u201cIf you knew then about what you know about Iraq now, would you have agreed with President George W. Bush to invade Iraq?\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, shall we? No reasonable person would agree to invade Iraq today based on what we know now about weapons of mass destruction being stored in the country. Hindsight some 12 years later will always appear to be 20/20. At the time, President Bush and many foreign leaders around the world strongly believed in the threat Saddam Hussein posed to the Middle East as well as the United States and acted, accordingly.\n\nNo, this latest media ploy is not about asking a legitimate question of a contender for the nomination about his views on American military/foreign policy. Instead, this is an effort to bring up their favorite bogeyman, former President George W. Bush, and continue with a variation of the \u201cBush lied, troops died\u201d trope they hope will trip up Republicans and ostensibly help former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on her presumed path toward coronation to the presidency.\n\nI won\u2019t re-litigate whether Bush lied to topple the Iraqi dictator; I\u2019ll leave that to others such as Jamie Weinstein to debunk this absurd assertion. Something far more serious and more significant is at issue here, and the media largely ignores this bigger picture.\n\nThis past weekend, the strategic city of Ramadi\u2014capital of Anbar Province\u2014fell to ISIS terrorists. Reports from the region indicate as many as 500 soldiers were slaughtered in the once prosperous city of 850,000. As many as 20 U.S. military vehicles were seized along with caches of arms provided by our government to the Iraqi soldiers who fled in retreat.\n\nISIS now controls nearly one-third of what is called Iraq today, and Baghdad is just 6o miles away from Ramadi. The very real prospect exists that the already fragile Iraqi government could fall to ISIS. And then what?\n\nThat\u2019s a legitimate question to be asked, but it\u2019s one not posed to President Obama\u2019s two secretaries of state, Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. Both Clinton and Kerry supported President Bush\u2019s decision to go to war in 2002. Consider this from Mr. Kerry from October 9, 2002: \u201cIt would be na\u00efve to the point of grave danger not to believe that, left to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will provoke, misjudge, or stumble into a future, more dangerous confrontation with the civilized world. He has as much promised it\u2026.I mention these not because they are a cause to go to war in and of themselves, as the president previously suggested, but because they tell us a lot about the threat of the weapons of mass destruction and the nature of this man. We should not go to war because these things are in his past, but we should be prepared to go to war because of what they tell us about the future.\u201d\n\nThis is an effort to bring up their favorite bogeyman, former President George W. Bush, and continue with a variation of the \u201cBush lied, troops died\u201d trope.\n\nOr consider this floor speech by then-Senator Clinton from October 2002 regarding her support for the use of force in Iraq: \u201cIt is clear, however, that if left unchecked, Saddam Hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological or chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons.

Even at my tender age, I knew it was said in the same way that you might speculate about Martians landing in Washington, D.C., but I didn't care. A seed was planted. I already had dreams of movie stardom and a career in top-level espionage as a youngster, but from very early on, my being President of THESE United States was always looming in the distance of my girlhood fantasies.\n\nYou have to understand something: Politics wasn't as far removed from my childhood as it is for most kids. My house was a hotbed of political discussions as far back as I could remember, a bubbling cauldron stirred by, among others, my avowed socialist grandfather, Sam, and his son, who was my father, Jerome Barr. They were socialists stranded in Utah, the most Republican state in the union, but which also had roots in socialism, as the Mormon Church supplied cradle-to-grave protection for all of its Utah members, until the Goldwater Revolution of the \u201960s that became the Reagan Revolution of the 1980s. In other words: From the beginning, I was no stranger to Realpolitik AND the potentially desperate need to swim against the tide. For those doubters who think my campaign of 2012 was a whim or just a gimmicky way to grab some attention, my documentary Roseanne For President will be an eye-opener.\n\nThat seed I mentioned at the top took root and kept growing, and in my late fifties, after nearly three decades in show business, I decided to ascend to the even loftier level of \u201cshow business\u2019 that is presidential politics. I did it for many reasons, but my favorite one was because of the theatrical farce of \u201changing chads\u201d which brought W to the Executive Office, and actually nullified our election system itself. At the urging of my friends, notably Cynthia McKinney, herself the last Green Party candidate for president, I agreed to take on the task and \u201ccarry the water\u201d for American workers.\n\nIt bears repeating: This was no publicity stunt.\n\nMy accomplishments in entertainment dwarf those of Ronald Reagan, whose real claim to fame was betraying his own socialist roots in Hollywood.\n\nAs I said early on the campaign trail and as you can see in the documentary that chronicles my run, I accepted the very real possibility that my bid to move into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue would squash my career as a stand-up comedian like a steamroller, and like many candidates in other countries where a \u201cSupreme Court\u201d determines who wins an election, I accepted that I could be killed or imprisoned here\u2014as was a former Green Party candidate, Nativo Lopez. But, I went for it, and survived it all, and may just do it again. As I say about the whole unlikely and idealistic quest: \u201cYou gotta start somewhere!\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just a throwaway line.\n\nWhen you see how much big money controls our politics and observe how stymied a president can be when Congress and the people who own it want to thwart his efforts, you come to realize that the presidency is not the seat of unbridled power it\u2019s sold as. If you haven\u2019t seen the late, great Bill Hicks\u2019 bit about the \u201cbriefing\u201d a newly-elected president gets from the shadowy figures who actually run things, well, let\u2019s just say it should be required viewing for anyone allergic to wool being pulled over their eyes.\n\nUpon election, according to Bill Hicks, the newly sworn-in president is taken to a private screening of the Kennedy assassination, filmed from a completely different angle than the one shown to the public. After the film ends, he is asked, \u201cAny questions?\u201d\n\nA few years ago, I saw a quote from George Washington that was so chilling it stopped me in my tracks. Our very first president said he feared that there might come a day when just a couple of wealthy parties could come to own our government. The first part was eerie enough, but I remember even pausing a little over the words \u201cour government.\u201d How many Americans comfortably say, much less really feel the words \u201cour government?\u201d\n\nListen, citizens: We\u2019ve been had. When the subject is government, we think of Democrats and Republicans like we think of salt and pepper. They like to sell themselves as being at the heart of it all straight from the gate\u2014as different as night and day but just as fundamental, and personifying and rhetorically asking the benevolent question, \u201cWhat more do you need?\u201d The deeply embedded image of two political parties standing like twin pillars that hold up \u201cour government\u201d is pure hype and BULLSHIT. There\u2019s nothing in the Constitution about Republicans or Democrats. There have been plenty of other parties: Democratic Republicans and National Republicans, and Federalists and Whigs, Socialists, and the best idea yet, in my opinion, a Woman\u2019s Party which is actually pro-women, founded by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Matilda Joslyn Gage about a century ago! For years now, there have been no real alternatives to our Coke-versus-Pepsi model, because most third parties never gain real nationwide traction, with all due respect to Ralph Nader, Ross Perot, and Eldridge Cleaver. We have to change that or accept the disturbing truth that we get what we deserve, and I and a growing tide of disappointed and disgusted citizens happen to think we deserve better.\n\nGetting back to me and my run: I never understood, much less bought the idea that a woman who\u2019s made a living in the entertainment industry should not be taken seriously if she wants to enter politics.\n\nAnd, somehow, lots of the knuckle-dragging mouth-breathers who say that actually think former alleged actor Ronald Reagan belongs on Mt. Rushmore!\n\nThe truth is: The only qualifications for getting into politics and even running for office should be citizenship and a desire to change things. I resented from day one the idea that my candidacy was some kind of vanity project and that I was utterly unqualified for a high political office. For some reason, people discounted the fact that along with being a comedian-writer-actor on a successful, long-running TV show, I was by association and necessity a successful businessperson; a job creator who gave a whole lot of talented, qualified artists and other skilled behind-the-scenes people their starts in a still-thriving industry.\n\nI always fought to bring a message with my comedy\u2014from the time I was a young woman stand-up comic struggling for stage time in a male-dominated field, and later in my years as a writer/performer on my show. That show was a huge commercial success, but more important to me was the fact that we brought bread-and-butter economic issues as well as social causes like labor\u2019s right to organize, gender equality, gay rights, our wasteful and unjust war on drugs, and much more into American living rooms and kitchen table and water cooler discussions. My accomplishments in entertainment dwarf those of Ronald Reagan, whose real claim to fame was betraying his own socialist roots in Hollywood. However, his campaign and his win served my fantasies of running. After all, if co-starring with a chimp and getting into bed with rich growers from Orange County can win both the presidency of the USA, as well as the office of Governor of California for both Reagan and the Austrian Arnold Schwarzenegger, then certainly, a much better actor and spokesperson for working Americans (me) could win too!\n\n\u201cPaul looks ready to have a meltdown or start throwing punches when a reporter asks a question he doesn\u2019t like, and Cruz is another candidate of the Dualistic Money Party of Elite Banksters who despise women...\u201d\n\n\n\nTo get to the nuts and bolts of my campaign, I started by seeking the nomination of the Green Party, and as my documentary reveals in some detail, the rest was quickly history. I\u2019ll let the movie speak for itself and move on to the fact that I was warmly received by the Peace and Freedom Party and, in spite of the roadblocks confronting anyone who\u2019s not marching under the banner of one of the two rich parties that George Washington feared, I was able to accomplish something I and everyone involved can be proud of. It was thanks to the efforts of regular Americans who were not paid, but acted out of a strong sense of their own, a sense which my friend Rick Overton calls \u201cMatriotism.\u201d They worked tirelessly against very strong entrenched forces to get my name placed on the ballot in three states. I received 67,000 votes and placed sixth in the national race, so that I could represent and serve those who worked to elect me.\n\nI raised a few thousand dollars for my campaign from the public through some fundraisers, but mostly, I used my recognition from the public at large, and my own time, money, and shoe leather attending debates, going to rallies, and making TV appearances with just about anyone who wanted to discuss my take on the issues, my motivation, and my real-world solutions. I was better known than every other socialist candidate, all of whom belittled me and my constituents, the Black Caucus, at every turn.\n\nSeveral of the foundational planks in my platform were debt forgiveness for student loans, a stimulus to housing, an end to the ridiculous, destructive \u201cWar on Drugs,\u201d single-payer health care, equal pay for women, marriage equality (I\u2019m also a staunch advocate for gay divorce, by the way!) and the nationalization of the Federal Reserve and Monsanto and Big Pharma.\n\nWait! Hey, \u201cThis just in,\u201d as they say: As I write this, Hillary Clinton has announced her presidential candidacy, this in the wake of a couple of birdbrains (no disrespect to birds) from the other branch of The Money Party throwing their dunce caps into the ring\u2014I\u2019m speaking of course of Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. Paul looks ready to have a meltdown or start throwing punches when a reporter asks a question he doesn\u2019t like, and Cruz is another candidate of the Dualistic Money Party of Elite Banksters who despise women, so of course, Clinton is painted as the more progressive candidate. The truth is, she is riding the gravy train of self-enrichment and entitlement subsidized by taxpayers who remain oblivious to the fact that they continually elect un-representatives who move public wealth into private pockets. This is not exactly the kind of redistribution that will save the middle class from extinction!\n\nLong story short: We\u2019ll now all have to slog through twenty months of mud-slinging from these shills for the status quo who call themselves Democrats and Republicans so that no one will be allowed to suspect they\u2019re all paid by the same people. We\u2019re right back to where I started with that dire prediction from George Washington: One day our government could be owned by a couple of rich political parties.

Who\u2019s the big kahuna? Jeb Bush? He keeps getting called front-runner, and I suppose he is, even though the polls sometimes say otherwise. Scott Walker? Certainly a player. Rand Paul? Pretty bad rollout, but he has his base. The youthful, advantageously ethnicized Marco Rubio? Some as-yet-unannounced entrant who can hop in and shake things up?\n\nEach has a claim, sort of, but the 800-pound gorilla of this primary process is none of the above. It\u2019s the same person it was in 2008, and again in 2012, when two quite plausible mainstream-conservative candidates had to haul themselves so far to the right that they ended up being unelectable. It\u2019s the Republican primary voter.\n\nTo be more blunt about it: the aging, white, very conservative, revanchist, fearful voter for whom the primary season is not chiefly an exercise in choosing a credible nominee who might win in November, but a Parris Island-style ideological obstacle course on which each candidate must strain to outdo his competitors\u2014the hate-on-immigrants wall climb, the gay-bashing rope climb, the death-to-the-moocher-class monkey bridge. This voter calls the shots, and after the candidates have run his gauntlet, it\u2019s almost impossible for them to come out looking appealing to a majority of the general electorate.\n\nYou will recall the hash this voter made of 2012. He booed the mention of a United States soldier during a debate because the soldier happened to be gay. He booed contraception\u2014mere birth control, which the vast majority of Republican women, like all women, use. He lustily cheered the death penalty. He tossed Rick Perry out on his ear in part because the Texas governor had the audacity to utter a few relatively humane words about children of undocumented immigrants. He created an atmosphere in which the candidates on one debate stage were terrified of the idea of supporting a single dollar in tax increases even if placed against an offsetting $10 in spending cuts.\n\nYou can\u2019t be a smart candidate in a party that wants to be stupid.\n\nHe is a demanding fellow. And he is already asserting his will this time around. Why else did Bush endorse Indiana Governor Mike Pence\u2019s religious freedom bill in an instant, only to see Pence himself walk the bill back three days later? Bet Jeb would like to have that one back. But he can\u2019t. The primary voter\u2014along of course with the conservative media from Limbaugh and Fox on down\u2014won\u2019t permit it.\n\nNow, as it happens, some of these candidates come to us with a few serious and unorthodox ideas. We all know about Rand Paul and his ideas about sentencing reform and racial disparities. He deserved credit for them. He was a lot quicker on the draw on Ferguson than Hillary Clinton was. But how much do we think he\u2019s going to be talking up this issue as the Iowa voting nears? Time might prove me wrong here, but Paul has already, ah, soul-searched his way to more standard right-wing positions on Israel and war, so there\u2019s reason to think that while he might not do the same on prison issues, he\u2019ll just quietly drop them.\n\nMore interesting in this regard is Rubio. I read his campaign book not long ago, along with five others, for a piece I wrote for The New York Review of Books. Rubio\u2019s book was the best of the lot by far. It was for the most part actually about policy. He put forward a few perfectly good ideas in the book. For example, he favors \u201cincome-based repayment\u201d on student loans, which would lower many students\u2019 monthly student-loan bills. It\u2019s a fine idea. The Obama administration is already doing it.\n\nBeyond the pages of the book, Rubio has in the past couple of years staked out some positions that stood out at the time as not consisting of fare from the standard GOP menu. He\u2019d like to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to more childless couples. Again, there are synergies here with the current occupant of the house Rubio wants to move into\u2014the Obama administration is taking up this idea.\n\nNow, there is to be sure another Rubio, one who\u2019d feel right at home on Parris Island. He is apparently now the quasi-official blessed-be-the-warmakers candidate, with his reflexive hard lines on Iran and Cuba. Along with Senate colleague Mike Lee of Utah, he also has put forth a tax plan that would deplete the treasury by some $4 trillion over 10 years\u2014for context, consider that George W. Bush\u2019s first tax cut cost $1.35 trillion over a decade\u2014in order that most of those dollars be placed in the hands where the Republicans\u2019 God says they belong, i.e., the 1 percent of the people who already hold nearly half the country\u2019s wealth.\n\nI think it\u2019s a safe bet that we\u2019ll see the neocon Rubio and the supply-side Rubio out on the stump. But the Rubio who wants to make life better for indebted students and working-poor childless couples? Either we won\u2019t see that Rubio at all, or we will see him and he\u2019ll finish fourth in Iowa and New Hampshire and go home. You can\u2019t be a smart candidate in a party that wants to be stupid.\n\nMight I be wrong about the primary voter? Sure, I might. Maybe the fear of losing to Hillary Clinton and being shut out of the White House for 12 or 16 consecutive years will tame this beast. But the early signs suggest the opposite.\n\nAfter all, how did Scott Walker bolt to the front of the pack? It wasn\u2019t by talking about how to expand health care. It was by giving one speech, at an event hosted by one of Congress\u2019 most fanatical reactionaries (Steve King of Iowa), bragging about how he crushed Wisconsin\u2019s municipal unions.

They supposedly represent a trend because they\u2019re all \u201coutsiders,\u201d or \u201canti-party men,\u201d as David Brooks recently put it. But it isn\u2019t just Brooks of course; this is the clich\u00e9 of the moment.\n\nJournalists are always on the lookout for patterns, and we\u2019re all taught in j-school that if we can just come up with three, bam, we\u2019ve got not a mere coincidence but a verifiable social trend on our hands, and this gives us license to start waxing sociological. This is the famous Rule of Three, and I guess we all do it (actually, Brooks tossed in a fourth, British Labour\u2019s Jeremy Corbyn, whose fate will be known when leadership results are announced tomorrow, in case you\u2019re interested), but the years have taught me to arch an eyebrow every time I see it invoked. And I\u2019m arching one here in a big way. Because Bernie Sanders is nothing like Donald Trump or Ben Carson.\n\nYeah, yeah, he\u2019s anti-establishment. But Sanders is anti a completely different establishment from the establishment that Trump and Carson are against. Trump and Carson are against the liberal establishment\u2014Barack Obama, the Clintons, the liberal media, political correctness, and so on. It\u2019s slightly more complicated in Trump\u2019s case than Carson\u2019s, since Trump does take a few heterodox positions like taxing the hedge-fund guys, while Carson is straight paleocon from top to bottom. But basically, these two are running against the liberal elite.\n\nSanders, in contrast, is running against the actual establishment: the moneyed class, Wall Street, the banks, the people who buy and sell the political class. He seeks a wholesale transfer of wealth and power from the top 1 percent to the 99. Trump is the 1 percent, and Carson reveres them. How can anybody possibility see the remotest similarity?\n\nTrump has one specific policy, which is a ludicrous one (hire enough badges to round up and deport 11 million people), and Carson has no major interesting policy positions that I\u2019m aware of.\n\nHere\u2019s more: Sanders is far more substantive than either Trump or Carson. Off the top of my head, I can think of the following list of Sanders proposals: free college tuition, higher taxes on the rich, an increased minimum wage, infrastructure investments, and fairly specific actions on immigration and climate change and criminal justice and a whole range of issues. He is a person of substance on domestic policy. And even though foreign policy is not Sanders\u2019s strong suit, I would wager that he knows the difference between the Quds Forces and the Kurds and has a pretty good idea of who Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is. Meanwhile, Trump has one specific policy, which is a ludicrous one (hire enough badges to round up and deport 11 million people), and Carson has no major interesting policy positions that I\u2019m aware of.\n\nOK, I\u2019m sure he probably has some, but the fact that I don\u2019t know them\u2014and you probably don\u2019t either\u2014is telling, and it gets to the heart of why Sanders is not like Trump or Carson. It has to do not with differences among these three men, their character and qualities and whatnot; it has to do with the differences between anger on the left and anger on the right, and how both are manifested. People on the left are angry about economics\u2014about inequality and the new Gilded Age, and they have rallied to Sanders because of his positions. People on the right are angry about liberals and moochers and society and culture, and they have rallied to Trump and Carson because of who they are (or aren\u2019t).\n\nYou might say but Tomasky, they rallied to Trump because of his immigration position. No\u2014they rallied to him because of the way he said it. Because he said rapists. Let\u2019s be honest here. Do you really think that with exactly the same policy, but without the bombastic rhetoric, Trump would be at 30 percent? No chance. The deportation policy might get him to 15. But it\u2019s the way he communicates his contempt for liberal pieties that got him to 30. That\u2019s what conservatives love.\n\nCarson is a different case. He\u2019s mild-mannered and soft-spoken. Even I would say he seems like a nice gentleman, his 17th-century views and his willingness to say blatantly untrue things aside. But he, too, has elitist liberals and political correctness firmly in his gun sights. And he\u2019s a good Christian man, his little devotional book peddled in Christian bookstores across the country for years now. And like Trump\u2014this is the one obvious thing they have in common\u2014he\u2019s never been an elected official, isn\u2019t part of the problem, isn\u2019t Jeb!\n\nIn other words: For the angry right, it\u2019s more about affect and style. Now granted, there\u2019s a certain amount of affect and style in Sanders\u2019s appeal, too; the way he shakes his fist, the way his jowls vibrate, the way that Noo Yawk accent reverberates. He sounds like he means business when he talks smack on Wall Street. I\u2019m not saying here that people on the left are wholly substantive and people on the right are wholly superficial. It\u2019s not that stark.\n\nBut I will say this: I think there is zero chance that a left-wing Trump or Carson would be blowing away the field in a Democratic primary contest. They\u2019d be the marginal candidates that they deserve to be. In fact, a left-wing Trump probably wouldn\u2019t even be running as a Democrat but as the Green Party candidate or something, because a left-wing Trump would think the Democrats were just as corrupt and hopeless as the Republicans, because that\u2019s how left-wingers think. The fringe people on the right take part in the two-party system, while the fringe people on the left by and large don\u2019t. So most of left-wing Trump\u2019s voters wouldn\u2019t even be participating in Democratic Party politics.\n\nSanders may or may not be a viable general-election nominee.

{"entityId": 1925, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The right to vote is seen as a sacred civic duty in the U.S., but should it also be mandatory to head to the polls on Election Day?\n\nPresident Obama gave a rather unusual answer to a question about money in politics during an event in Cleveland this week. His antidote for the burgeoning influence of fat stacks of Supreme Court-sanctioned cash on elections was fairly simple: make everyone vote.\n\n\u201cIf everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country,\u201d he said, adding that voting was mandatory in other countries. Universal participation would \u201ccounteract money more than anything.\u201d\n\nHe might have a point.\n\nVoter participation\u2013or, more accurately, non-participation\u2013is a giant pimple on the face of American democracy, one that the U.S. been unable to pop since the 1960s.\n\nEvery two years, an average of 56 percent of eligible voters (PDF) participate in their own self-governance, weighed heavily towards presidential contests. Midterms usually draw around 40 percent, putting 2014\u2019s dismal effort only slightly below average.\n\nLine that up next to other industrialized democracies and it\u2019s not pretty. Great Britain usually gets around three quarters of its population to the polls in national elections.\n\nGreece, the birthplace of democracy and modern geopolitical punchline, gets 86 percent. Australia\u2019s citizens turn out in droves, averaging a 95 percent turnout down under.\n\nHow do the Aussies do it? Quite simply, they make their citizens vote\u2013or at least show up.\n\n\u201cIf everybody voted, then it would completely change the political map in this country,\u201d President Obama said, adding that voting was mandatory in other countries. Universal participation would \u201ccounteract money more than anything.\u201d\n\nThey are forced to register, forced to appear at a polling station on Election Day, and forced to at least make a mark on the ballot paper. By law, they don\u2019t actually have to choose a candidate or party, but you\u2019d imagine the phrase \u201cmight as well\u201d applies here.\n\nAustralia, cited by the president in his Wednesday remarks, is not the only country with compulsory voting, and not the only one to see strong turnout. Argentina has it, and usually sees around 85 percent participation. Brazil does too, and usually turns out at a rate around 80 percent. All of these are enforced compulsory systems: that is, there is a penalty (normally a fine) if a citizen cannot reasonably explain why they did not vote.\n\nNow, none of those three are examples of ideal democratic outcomes at present, but at least they have robust participation. The United States faces a formidable participation gap, partly because, quite frankly, not enough people care.\n\nBut the U.S. has also been doing all the wrong things, policy-wise, for decades.\n\nRather than make it easier to vote, lawmakers here have been putting up barriers to participation.\n\nNew York and Ohio eliminated same-day voter registration in 1965 and 1977 respectively. According to political scientist Marjorie Random Hershey, turnout dropped by 7 percent in the subsequent elections and between 3 and 5 percent over the longer term (PDF). Many states have imposed early closing dates for registration, and if there were no closing date (in other words, same-day registration), some experts \u201cestimate that\u2026turnout would increase by 6.1 percent\u201d across the nation. Early voting has also been scaled back in a number of states, including Ohio and North Carolina, where 7 in 10 black Americans vote early.\n\nThen there are Voter ID laws, passed to combat the largely mythical phenomenon known as voter fraud.\n\nTo start, voter fraud does not exist in any significant sense. Out of the 197 million votes cast in federal elections between 2000 and 2005, only 26 (yes, twenty-six) votes eventually resulted in convictions for voter fraud. That is .00000013 percent, and it indicates that no one committing voter fraud could have affected any federal election in any way during that time.\n\nYet eight states have strict photo ID requirements to vote, and a further six have strict non-photo ID policies. And these policies can suppress the vote.\n\nHershey\u2019s study cites Vercellotti and Anderson\u2019s (2006), which found that \u201cnon-photo and photo ID rules were associated with lower turnout in 2004, in the range of 3 to 4 percent.\u201d Laws enacted in Kansas and Tennessee dropped turnout by 2 percent between 2008 and 2012, according to the non-partisan Government Accountability Office. Texas\u2019s policies, some of the most restrictive in the nation, were also heavily scrutinized after the 2014 election.\n\nAll of these figures are across the demographic board, leaving aside that these policies have been accused of being partisan and discriminatory, disproportionately affecting minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged.\n\nVoter ID is just the latest in a long line of counterproductive policies when it comes to the ballot box. The suppression numbers associated are not huge, but there is a pile-on effect.\n\nThat\u2019s because the decision to vote is an economic one. There\u2019s an element of civic duty or pride, sure, but the individual essentially conducts a cost\u2013benefit analysis with regard to how they spend their time and money. The more obstacles that are put in the way of voter participation, from restricting early voting to banning voting out-of-district to requiring IDs (which cost time and money to procure), the higher the opportunity cost and the fewer people will vote.\n\nThe end result is that the laws and regulations governing voting in some states are thoroughly undemocratic.\n\nThankfully, though, the U.S. is not some sort of uniformly hopeless electoral dystopia. Some states are making progress. Oregon, along with more recent converts Washington and Colorado (the Civic-Minded Stoner Bloc) has conducted all mail-in voting for years. All enjoyed turnouts of 64 percent turnout or higher in 2012, well above the national average, with Colorado at 71 percent.\n\nThis week, Oregon crossed into new territory in its efforts to get out the vote. Under the new policy, all eligible voters will be registered automatically unless they opt out. Now the Oregon secretary of state\u2019s office will mail all voting-age citizens a ballot 20 days before any election. They need only send it back with a few marks of a pen.\n\nOregon\u2019s is a step in the right direction, emphasizing ease of voting over mandates. Compulsory voting does not hold all the answers\u2013though some political scientists credit it with as much as double-digit gains in turnout percentage\u2013and there are other ways to avoid ghastly-looking turnout numbers. After all, Britain and Greece are doing just fine without it. Belgium, where mandatory voting policies have not been enforced since 2003, averages 90 percent turnout.\n\nThough it would likely bring more people to the polls, it\u2019s not immediately clear how, as the president says, mandatory voting would combat money\u2019s influence on American politics. Maybe he\u2019s hoping that the few people whose lives aren\u2019t consumed by political advertisements in the run-up to Election Day\u2013that is, who don\u2019t own a TV or computer\u2013would show up. Maybe his roots in community organizing tell him there's strength in numbers, that there's power to be found in the kind of mass participation by informed citizens that is simply lacking today.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:24.917+0000"}

The terror group may have romped in Ramadi and Palmyra, but the Obama administration isn\u2019t changing its strategy, despite growing doubts in the Pentagon.\n\nThe self-proclaimed Islamic State has claimed a major provincial capital in Iraq and taken over another strategically key city in Syria. In response, the Obama administration plans to do\u2014well, not much of anything new.\n\nFour defense officials told The Daily Beast that there\u2019s still strong resistance within the Obama administration to making any serious changes to the current strategy for fighting ISIS\u2014despite mounting skepticism from some in the Pentagon about the current U.S. approach to the war.\n\nAlthough the Obama administration\u2019s public messaging is that it still wants to \u201cdegrade and ultimately defeat\u201d ISIS, in reality, many in the Pentagon view the real objective as just running out the clock.\n\n\u201cI think this is driven by a sense that this not our fight and so we are just going to try to contain it and have influence where we can,\u201d one official who works closely on the military strategy explained to The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is a long fight, and it will be up to the next administration to tackle.\u201d\n\nRather than aiming for a decisive victory, the U.S. approach has devolved into simply maintaining a low boil in perpetuity.\n\nThey said they realize that the political strategy supersedes the military one; there is no public appetite for ground troops in Iraq; there is frustration about corruption within the Iraqi government; and there is a lack of a clear alternative approach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political response,\u201d one official explained. \u201cThey are doing \u2018something\u2019 to inoculate themselves from substantial criticism.\u201d\n\nSome are more blunt, saying no one wants to invest too much time or resources in crafting an alternative.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a political response,\u201d one official explained. \u201cThey are doing \u2018something\u2019 to inoculate themselves from substantial criticism.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho wants a soldier to come home dead or without a leg or captured by ISIS for forces that retreat?\u201d a second defense official asked.\n\nTo be sure, the Pentagon brass has yet to offer alternative strategies to fighting ISIS. Most recently, the U.S.-led coalition did not even ramp up its airstrikes after ISIS claimed the Sunni-dominated Iraqi city of Ramadi on May 18. Since then, the coalition has conducted an average of three strikes a day, targeting vehicles and fighting positions. U.S. officials insist they strike whenever they get good intelligence on ISIS positions.\n\nWith no change in airstrikes and a ground force that has retreated, ISIS has successfully\u2014and without any major impediments\u2014built berms, receiving and building other defenses against a promised counterattack by Iraqi security forces.\n\nEven the mildest adjustments are being met with resigned silence, four defense officials told The Daily Beast. En route to Singapore on Wednesday, Secretary of Defense Ash Carter told reporters that he had convened a meeting with \u201chis team\u201d about Iraqi and said the military was examining how \u201cto increase the effectiveness of the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t describe to you what the possibilities are because folks are looking at them right now,\u201d Carter added.\n\nBut rather than adjust the strategy, the U.S. military is considering small tactical changes\u2014in how quickly it conducts airstrikes after the Iraqis request them and how to provide Iraqi ground forces weapons and equipment quicker. Among the ideas Carter proposed was speeding up the training of Sunni tribesmen. Army Colonel Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, emphasized to reporters Thursday the U.S. is looking only to \u201cfine-tune\u201d its tactics, not overhaul its strategy.\n\nThe secretary noted the military is responsible for two of the nine lines of effort the U.S. is using toward Iraq, which include financial and political pressure, but there was no evidence Thursday that those lines were being reconsidered, either.\n\nBut neither a lack of airpower nor weapons appeared to lead to Ramadi\u2019s fall. While the Iraqis feared that a sandstorm would limit coalition airstrikes, U.S. officials said that was not the case. And the Iraqi army vastly outnumbered ISIS forces, and there is no evidence its soldiers suffered a major weapons shortage.\n\nRather it appears ISIS had fighters hidden in the city who built scores of car bombs\u2014some the size of the bomb used in the Oklahoma City bombing attack\u2014and a strike plan to follow that flustered Iraq Special Forces, or Golden Brigades, who retreated, followed by brigade forces.\n\nCritics of officials at U.S. Central Command, which is in charge of the U.S. military approach toward the Middle East, note that military leaders have yet to publicly propose a strategy that does not involve a major ground force presence. That\u2019s something the White House simply won\u2019t accept.\n\nAt a breakfast with reporters Thursday, General Raymond T. Odierno, the chief of staff of the Army and a former top commander in Iraq, said he was \u201cadamant\u201d about not sending U.S. ground forces back to Iraq.\n\n\u201cIt always comes back to the government of Iraq,\u201d Odierno said.\n\nAnd while U.S. officials have said they are committed to a united Iraq, privately two officials said that many anticipate what they described as \u201cthe Balkanization of Iraq\u201d along sectarian and ethnic lines.\n\nThe U.S. military\u2019s initial response to Ramadi was to blame the Iraqi military for failing to take on the outnumbered ISIS forces. Both Carter and Army General Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the Iraqis retreated. In an interview with CNN, Carter said the Iraqi army lacked \u201cthe will to fight\u201d for its country.\n\nWhen the U.S.-led air campaign began nearly a year ago, it, by most accounts, achieved its initial goal of stopping ISIS\u2019s momentum, which was ascending with the capture of the Iraqi city of Mosul. There were fears then that the group could move on to Baghdad.\n\nBut since then, ISIS has adjusted while the U.S. strategy has not, the defense officials said. And an air campaign that once could contain ISIS no longer can as the group has developed the skills to create a military plan against an army that outnumbers it by 10 to 1, as in Ramadi, according to U.S. military estimates.\n\nU.S. officials often note they have destroyed 6,300 targets since the strikes began. But critics pointed out that statistics are not always an indicator of a working strategy.\n\n\u201cEvery agency is briefing that they are having effect,\u201d the first official explained. \u201cBut it is activity, not effect.\u201d\n\nSenator Rand Paul, who is running for the Republican nomination for president, has been a frequent and enthusiastic critic of the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy and of U.S. military intervention in the Middle East in general. On Thursday, his senior adviser, Doug Stafford, told The Daily Beast, \u201cSenator Paul called months ago for a declaration of war against ISIS.\u201d That declaration, unveiled in November, would have allowed for boots on the ground. Stafford said Paul called \u201cfor arming the Kurds\u201d and \u201cfor insisting on boots on the ground from neighboring countries.\u201d (The declaration actually specified limited use of American troops on the ground in specific circumstances.)\n\nStafford added, \u201cThis shouldn\u2019t be a political issue or one that is mired in bad strategy from the Obama administration, and it shouldn\u2019t be left for the next president.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Olivia Nuzzi", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:25.065+0000"}

Forbes estimates that he\u2019s worth less than half that much, around $4 billion. Does it matter? The answer is definitively no, because once the Donald Trump presidential charade is over he\u2019s gonna be worth much more than $8 billion\u2014and worth every penny of it.\n\nI have to say up front I\u2019ve known Trump for years and I like him even if much of his presidential announcement speech had my skin crawling. (Describing many Mexican immigrants as \u201crapists\u201d is at the top of my list.) But I have long appreciated Trump\u2019s resilience both in business and in his personal life; anyone who remembers the early 1990s vintage Trump, when he was both mocked as a business has-been and was by some estimates insolvent, also knows that more recently his name and brand keeps getting bigger and his wives keep getting hotter.\n\nAll of which leads me to believe that this man\u2014who needs to brag about his wealth and intelligence like most people need to breathe\u2014is looking at this presidential thing like he looks at everything else: how to make a brand that\u2019s big and profitable even more so.\n\nFor the record, I don\u2019t know how much Donald Trump is worth, and in the past he has been touchy when reporters have challenged his fortune\u2019s size. (He sued one reporter who quoted unnamed sources saying Trump was merely worth hundreds of millions instead of billions for libel. In 2011, a New Jersey appellate judge dismissed the case, saying Trump failed to prove \u201cactual malice.\u201d)\n\nEven so, every Wall Street firm I covered wanted Trump\u2019s business as he pulled himself back from his near-death experience in the early 1990s, when some of his Atlantic City properties filed for bankruptcy. Trump himself never filed for bankruptcy, which is probably why, as he began to rebuild himself, his Wall Street broker was none other than the late Alan \u201cAce\u201d Greenberg, the legendary stock trader who only handled accounts of the megawealthy.\n\nDonald Trump isn\u2019t really running for president; he\u2019s running to make more money and enhance a brand that\u2019s bigger than his real-estate holdings and golf courses.\n\nTo be sure, in his announcement speech Trump offered scant evidence that he\u2019s worth what he says he is; indeed, he has just filed the standard forms with the Federal Election Commission, which will start a more-intensive vetting process over his financial disclosures.\n\nThose forms are pretty exhaustive, I might add; just go to the website of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and take a look at what candidates need to disclose and you\u2019ll understand why rich people generally don\u2019t run for president. Candidates are required to disclose, in detail, assets and income, then transactions and gifts and travel reimbursements. Another layer of detail involves disclosing liabilities and something called \u201cagreements or arrangements.\u201d\n\nLastly, presidential candidates must disclose \u201cpositions (other than with the U.S. government)\u201d and \u201csources of income in excess of $5,000.\u201d This is why Karl Rove said on Fox News Sunday that other candidates should \u201cignore\u201d Trump until he files with the FEC, which he did late Monday afternoon.\n\nTrump fired back on Twitter: \u201c@KarlRove still thinks Romney won! He doesn\u2019t have a clue! @FoxNews,\u201d and in another he vowed to make his initial financial disclosures this week: \u201c@KarlRove, who spent $430 million in the last cycle and didn\u2019t win one race, said I\u2019m not a candidate until I file papers. Next week Karl!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager told me that the full disclosure will be completed in 30 days; Trump, he said, won\u2019t seek extensions as Rove and others have predicted.\n\nWe shall see. In any event, like Rove, I had my doubts that Trump would go through with the whole disclosure process. What I never doubted is that he loves the attention because the debate over the net worth of the new and improved Donald Trump no longer turns on the vagaries of the real-estate market but on the value of his brand.\n\nKeep in mind much of the difference between the Forbes net worth estimate and Trump\u2019s own, which he says was compiled by \u201chighly respected\u201d accountants, is the value of the Trump brand, which Forbes says isn\u2019t worth the $3 billion-plus Trump says it is.\n\nBut how do you really value a brand? Brands are worth what people think they\u2019re worth, and when you\u2019re name is everywhere from hotels and apartments buildings to reality TV, it\u2019s easy to see how the numbers add up and will keep adding up as he does this presidential dance that, quite frankly, is amazing reality television.\n\nThat\u2019s why I have no doubt that Trump will turn this new \u201cserious\u201d stage of his life into a business winner. The way I see it, Donald Trump isn\u2019t really running for president; he\u2019s running to make more money and enhance a brand that\u2019s bigger than his real-estate holdings and golf courses. And with the people who matter to him the most, it doesn\u2019t get cheapened by occasionally disgusting rhetoric about immigrants or possible exaggerations about his wealth.\n\nHe\u2019s playing to his fans and there are many millions of them. They like him on television and they like his real estate and golf courses. Another bet: I don\u2019t think Donald will run for president after all, regardless of Monday\u2019s FEC filing, or even if he does make those detailed financial disclosures and somehow gins up enough publicity to get into the first GOP debate in August.\n\nIn the end, I think he will call it quits because, after awhile, Donald is going to realize he\u2019s squeezed all the marketing juice out of the presidential lemon that is possible, and anything more will end up hurting, not helping, one of the world\u2019s great brands.\n\nHe knows that, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s so rich.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:25.502+0000"}

We leap forward by yards, fall back by inches, and leap forward once more, eventually becoming, as President Obama said last Friday, \u201ca more perfect union.\u201d\n\nThink about it: 150 years ago, the Civil War ended, and with it went the odious institution of slavery, banned constitutionally through the 13th Amendment. Fifty-five years, later, in 1920, women, long denied the ballot, were given the right to vote. Less than a half a century forward came a complement of civil rights reform through the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the Fair Housing Act of 1968. We may have setbacks\u2014African Americans went from slavery into decades of indentured servitude, bigotry and systematic injustice; women suffered discrimination and further decades of second-class citizenry; voting rights are being challenged today, disproportionately affecting those people of color, and putting at risk the strides made 50 years ago this summer\u2014but we never go back completely to the way things were.\n\nOn Friday, June 26, 2015, after years of struggle and sacrifice, debate and dispute, polemics and pain, we leapt forward.

Though gay marriage is currently supported by 53 percent of Americans while 47 percent, primarily in C and D counties, oppose it, is there any doubt that half a century from now Americans will look back at a time when gay and lesbian Americans were denied the right to marry as unimaginable?\n\nAmericans, as diverse as we are, as divided and disparate as we can be, are united in timeless tenets that help define us as a people and as a nation: belief in egalitarian liberty, respect for the law, and a proclivity toward basic fairness. We saw that last Friday.\n\nSo, before we move on, before we get caught up in the controversies and tempests of another day, let\u2019s savor this moment.

And was Bill Clinton as far behind in 1991 as Rick Santorum is today?\n\nBy Lauren Carroll and Jon Greenberg\n\nLongshot Democratic presidential hopeful Lincoln Chafee wants to put the country on the metric system. Did Republican icon Ronald Reagan want to, as well?\n\nThat\u2019s what Chafee suggested Sunday in an interview with CNN.\n\n\u201cThere are only two other countries that aren\u2019t metric, Myanmar and Liberia. And so it\u2019s time for America not only economically but symbolically to join the rest of the world,\u201d said Chafee, a former governor and U.S. senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\u201cI know that many in the scientific community, the health care community, that have to deal internationally, the business community, are saying this is way overdue,\u201d Chafee added. \u201cRonald Reagan talked about it. Others have talked about it.\u201d\n\n\n\nWhether you measure in meters or yards, Chafee\u2019s claim about Reagan is off by a bit. We rate it Half True.\n\nBefore Reagan took office, President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act, which created a board charged with leading the planning and educational efforts for switching over to the metric system.\n\nIt was Reagan, in 1982, who effectively dismantled the switch to the metric system by stripping funding.\n\nThe Reagan administration explained the cuts as part of a general reduction in federal spending, rather than opposition to conversion\u2014preferring to leave conversion to the private sector. Reagan\u2019s budget proposal said: \u201cThe board has accomplished its mission to familiarize the public with the metric system. Voluntary metrication will continue through market adjustments.\u201d\n\nFast-forward to 1988. In Reagan\u2019s last year in office, he signed into law an omnibus trade bill that included a slight amendment to the original 1975 Metric Conversion Act. Tucked into the 1,000-page bill was a declaration that the metric system was \u201cthe preferred system of weights and measures for United States trade and commerce\u201d and called for federal agencies to switch to the metric system wherever practical by 1992.\n\nSo, at best, you can say Reagan\u2019s efforts on the metric system were a bit of a mixed bag.\n\nToday, not all, but many federal agencies\u2014including the military\u2014use metric units almost exclusively, according to a statement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\nMany metric experts estimate that the United States is 50 percent metric, said U.S. Metric Association President Don Hillger, a meteorologist at Colorado State University. While most Americans use customary units in their homes, those in science and heavy industry typically use the metric system.\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, if you would have taken the top two-thirds of the folks in 1992, Bill Clinton wouldn\u2019t have been on the stage.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we really are on the metric standard in the U.S.,\u201d Hillger said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that we continue to use non-metric units that no other major country uses anymore.\u201d\n\nOn Fox News Sunday, Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum criticized the rules set up for August\u2019s first GOP presidential debate\u2014which just happens to be organized by Fox News.\n\nFox News says it will invite only the top 10 GOP candidates, according to national polls. That might leave Santorum on the outside looking in.\n\n\u201cThe idea that we should use a national poll to determine who is going to be one of the final\u2014one of the finalists in the presidential race, I just think is\u2014first off, not a good barometer,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cBut most important thing is, we have 16, 15, 14, I don\u2019t know who\u2019s going to end up running or not running, really good people. And that shouldn\u2019t be something that we should be worried about and try to select down, but we should have the opportunity for everyone to be heard.\n\n\u201cAnd, you know, if you would have taken the top two-thirds of the folks in 1992, Bill Clinton wouldn\u2019t have been on the stage,\u201d Santorum said.\n\nThat claim rates Mostly False.\n\nWhat we found suggests Santorum is right that Clinton started the year before the presidential election, 1991, with low polling numbers. But Santorum is making a comparison that doesn\u2019t quite fit because of the huge difference in the 1992 primaries versus the one beginning now. Moreover, by the time the Democratic candidates did debate in 1991, Clinton was not doing as poorly in the polls as Santorum claims.\n\nFiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver accumulated and analyzed several cycles of presidential primary polls, including the cycle leading up to the 1992 election.\n\nSilver was able to find just three polls from January-June 1991, a period comparable to today. And the ones he did showed Clinton at the back of a crowded field\u2014with an average of just 1.7 percent. That was good enough for 13th out of 19 prospective candidates.\n\nIn a hypothetical sense, a debate that included the top two-thirds of those candidates just barely might have excluded Clinton.\n\nThe problem with such a hypothetical is that there were hardly any declared Democrats running for president by June 1991. One of the conditions for the Fox News debate is that only official, announced, and registered candidates need apply. In mid-1991, the would-be frontrunner was New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. He ended up not running. And in fact, the top nine candidates in early polls that year all declined to run, Silver found. Clinton himself didn\u2019t announce his candidacy until October 1991.\n\nSo a snapshot of June 1991 versus June 2015 is hardly useful. Neither is a comparison that focuses on an August 2015 debate.\n\nThe earliest debates in the 1992 cycle we found were an NBC debate on Dec. 15, 1991, and one sponsored by PBS on Jan. 19, 1992. By then, the hypothetical field had been narrowed to real candidates, and the polling wasn\u2019t as unfavorable to Clinton.\n\nBy the time of the first debates, there were five main Democratic candidates: Clinton, former California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Sens. Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey, and Paul Tsongas. A sixth candidate, Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder, withdrew on Jan. 8, 1992. He participated in the Dec. 15 debate but not the one on Jan. 19.\n\nThe polls then didn\u2019t show Clinton in the lead. But they showed him in the race. An average of nine polls from July to December 1991 put Clinton in fourth place, behind Brown, Cuomo (who didn\u2019t run) and Wilder (who dropped out).\n\nAaron Sharockman contributed to this report.

This can happen, I now know, if you happen to make the mistake of walking down the wrong pathway\u2014of a public park\u2014on your way to a Clinton speech.\n\n\u201cGet in!\u201d he barked. Then, a sigh: \u201cNot your fault.\u201d That\u2019s just the way things are around here.\n\nHere would be Hillary Island\u2014formerly Roosevelt Island\u2014a strip of land located in the middle of the East River between Manhattan and Queens that some 10,000 New Yorkers call home. More specifically, here is Four Freedoms Park\u2014a grassy island enclave named for the Four Freedoms FDR spelled out in his 1941 State of the Union speech: Freedom of speech, of worship, from want, and from fear\u2014where the Clinton team has assembled a red and blue stage, in the shape of an H, for her to pace on as she delivers her first major campaign speech.\n\nClinton formally declared her candidacy for the Democratic nomination almost exactly a month ago, in April, with a 2:15 video. \u201cEveryday Americans need a champion,\u201d she said then. \u201cAnd I wanna be that champion.\u201d\n\nSince that time, Clinton has not been heard from much as she has traveled around, talking to some voters and ignoring questions from the media and trying to seem as normal as possible despite being anything but. Saturday\u2019s event was designed to highlight her champion-ness by contrasting her with the New Deal Democrat, whose Four Freedoms she has attempted to mimic with her own \u201cFour Fights,\u201d the economy, families, campaign finance and national security.\n\nSaturday\u2019s event, according according to The New York Times, was organized by a small group of Clinton insiders including Huma Abedin, Clinton\u2019s longtime aide and the vice chair of her campaign and Jim Margolis, who helped orchestrate both inaugurations for President Obama.\n\nThe result felt borderline dystopian.\n\nRoosevelt Island, transformed by architects in the 1930s to serve as a \u201cliving memorial,\u201d looks like a cross between something out of Grand Theft Auto and a ghost town. It has a fake forest, and brutalist apartment complexes. Its abandoned insane asylum was turned into a luxury highrise.\n\n\u201cAnd one additional advantage: You won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House. I\u2019ve been coloring it for years!\u201d\n\nRoosevelt Island\u2019s Amalgamated Bank, owned by unions and serving unions, now sports a sign declaring it proud to be the bank of Hillary For America.\n\nAnd Four Freedoms Park, located partially beneath the 59th Street Bridge, is lush and green, and houses a decaying, vine-covered Smallpox Hospital, abandoned in the 1950s. The Hillary campaign installed a forest of port-a-potties and lined the walkways with arrow signs (Hillary\u2019s logo) pointing in the direction of her speech, which could be accessed by ascending a glimmering white staircase. In the distance, you could see the \u201cPepsi-Cola\u201d sign in Queens.\n\nSarah Rogers/The Daily Beast\n\nThe park feels divorced from Manhattan, whose skyscrapers loom from across the water, not just geographically, but spiritually. With the bomb-sniffing dogs, security guards, metal detectors, police officers, Men In Black-looking security guards and campaign staff speeding around on golf-carts, Hillary Island felt like its own world with its own rule. It\u2019s a serene summertime police state\u2014wherein campaign staffers told reporters to stay in their designated area, away from attendees\u2014pleasant and creepy at the same time.\n\nWhich might be the best way to describe Clinton herself during Saturday\u2019s launch.\n\nIn a royal blue blazer and glowing blonde hair, Clinton took to the stage to deliver her Four Fights speech. At times she sounded robotic, like the pol who won\u2019t take a position without poll testing it as she has been accused at others some humanity crept through. All the while, though, it was hard to shake the feeling that she was already president\u2014of this island.\n\nClinton borrowed from Elizabeth Warren and her primary competitor Bernie Sanders in her tough-talk about no-good corporations and the need for campaign finance reform. About the latter, she said, \u201cIf necessary, I will support a Constitutional amendment to undo the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Citizens United.\u201d\n\nShe repeatedly called for equal rights for the LGBT community, going as far as to criticize the GOP for \u201cturn[ing] their backs on gay people who love each other.\u201d (Something Clinton was doing herself just a few years ago.)\n\nSome of Clinton\u2019s notes were sour, however. In her criticism of the Republican field of candidates, Clinton alleged, \u201cNow, there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they\u2019re all singing the same old song\u2014a song called \u2018Yesterday.\u2019\u201d She continued, \u201cYou know the one\u2014all our troubles look as though they\u2019re here to stay, and we need a place to hide away. They believe in yesterday.\u201d Clinton tried to crack a joke, \u201cYou\u2019re lucky I didn\u2019t try singing that, too, I\u2019ll tell you!\u201d\n\nAt another point, Clinton said, \u201cI may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I will be the youngest woman President in the history of the United States! And the first grandmother as well.\u201d She followed it up with another attempted joke. \u201cAnd one additional advantage: You won\u2019t see my hair turn white in the White House.

{"entityId": 1932, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Republican establishment and the libertarian senator were already at odds. Then came the fight over government surveillance.\n\nAmong many of his Republican colleagues, Senator Rand Paul is, for now, Enemy No. 1.\n\nThe Patriot Act is (at least temporarily) dead, and his fellow Republicans are blaming the Kentucky senator for the problem. He is grandstanding for political purposes, they say\u2014and endangering national security in the process.\n\nFor a major Republican presidential candidate, Paul has certainly alienated a lot of Republicans\u2014especially hawks who believe in strong surveillance authorities for the intelligence community. Or, you might think, Paul has carved out a unique segment in the GOP field.\n\nAfter midnight on Monday, three major surveillance provisions contained within the Patriot Act expired. Paul took procedural steps to block any faster consideration of the USA Freedom Act, which would have continued but reformed those provisions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t stand with Rand,\u201d Republican Senator Mark Kirk told The Daily Beast, flipping Paul\u2019s campaign slogan. \u201cI disagree with him. I think we should not allow the program to be interrupted.\u201d\n\nIn a rare Sunday night vote for the Senate, called in a foiled attempt to address the issue before the Patriot Act provisions expired, fellow Republicans laid into Paul.\n\n\u201cI just saw a tweet from Senator Paul saying, \u2018Take a selfie of yourself when you\u2019re watching me on the floor tonight.\u2019 In case you missed it, take a look at it,\u201d Senator John McCain, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said dismissively. (McCain later joked, \u201cI\u2019m not good-looking enough to enjoy that.\u201d)\n\n\u201cUnfortunately I think it\u2019s part of the presidential campaign,\u201d said Senator John Cornyn, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate. \u201cThis really does raise the risk to the public. It does eliminate one of the tools that the intelligence community has to identify homegrown terrorists. It just seems to me at least reckless to not allow at least a temporary continuation of the bill while we have this debate. But that\u2019s not the way it\u2019s working.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t stand with Rand,\u201d Republican Senator Mark Kirk told The Daily Beast, flipping Paul\u2019s campaign slogan. \u201cI disagree with him. I think we should not allow the program to be interrupted.\u201d\n\nPaul insiders insist that there was no political calculus behind Sunday\u2019s event, but nevertheless demand anonymity when describing this matter of conscience.\n\n\u201cThere are certain things that are a matter of principle,\u201d one senior Paul adviser told The Daily Beast. The adviser added that even if Paul did believe his opposition to NSA spying might negatively impact his success in the Republican presidential primary, that wouldn\u2019t have stopped him from blocking the measure.\n\nThe three provisions that expired at midnight include Section 215, which was the legal basis for the NSA\u2019s bulk collection of metadata; the provision on roving wiretaps; and a section authorizing surveillance against so-called lone wolves.\n\nBut Paul\u2019s actions won\u2019t have lasting effect, from the perspective of the law.\n\nWhile the authorities are expiring, the expectation is that the Senate will return later this week to reauthorize sections of the Patriot Act, albeit with reforms and restrictions outlined in the House-passed USA Freedom Act. In the meantime, backdoor provisions and alternate collection schemes will allow U.S. spies to continue surveilling important targets.\n\nPolitically, that might not matter.\n\nThe fact is, Paul killed controversial parts of the Patriot Act\u2014bumper stickers aren\u2019t big enough for the details about how long their death lasted.\n\n\u201cWe should not be debating modifying an illegal program,\u201d Paul wrote in an op-ed for Time on Saturday. \u201cWe should simply end this illegal program.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke on the Senate floor, Paul tweeted, using the hashtag #endNSAspying\u2014and, at least once, #endNSA, something he said earlier in May he does not want to do. Paul\u2019s supporters sent him words of encouragement: \u201cKeep it up! We are listening!\u201d They also sent photos of themselves watching his speech on the Senate floor. The process even yielded some \u201c#babiesforRand.\u201d\n\nPaul\u2019s human-roadblock strategy has its benefits: It puts him in the spotlight fighting a battle in which he has remained consistent throughout his political career. And perhaps more important than that, the burst of attention comes both after a period of doubt among some of Paul\u2019s more staunchly libertarian supporters and, conveniently, while he is promoting his latest book.\n\nOver the past year, as Paul has traveled the country campaigning, a central question has followed him: to what degree will he sacrifice the \u201clibertarian-ish\u201d principles that took him from his Bowling Green ophthalmology practice and into the United States Senate in order to appeal to the broader GOP electorate?\n\nSenator Paul would not exist without the supporters he inherited from his father, Ron Paul, but he has let them down with his compromises, like signing the Iran letter and voicing his support for the Obama administration\u2019s drone policy.\n\nPaul\u2019s opposition to the Patriot Act, despite the risk it carries, is a nod to those supporters that he is not leaving them behind, not that he could afford to lose them.\n\nPaul\u2019s surveillance-ending stunt places him happily in opposition to the Obama administration and his rivals in the Republican primary field. Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and Marco Rubio favor a robust metadata collection program. Ted Cruz was an early co-sponsor of the USA Freedom Act, which would reform the Patriot Act and end the government\u2019s bulk collection of American metadata.\n\n\u201cI recognize that there is nothing you very kind folks in the media like more than Republican-on-Republican violence. You would like me to say something negative about my friend Rand, but I have no intention of doing so,\u201d Cruz told reporters Sunday night.\n\nThat said, Cruz opposes Paul\u2019s actions in the Senate, which forced the (brief) expiration of surveillance authorities.\n\n\u201cI disagree with allowing key provisions of federal law to expire that allow the national security team to target radical Islamic terrorists,\u201d Cruz said.\n\n\n\nBack in November, Paul and Cruz battled over the USA Freedom Act, with Paul ultimately winning when the bill was defeated. The measure didn\u2019t go far enough to fix the problem, Paul argued. Cruz countered that to fix the problem, you had to do it from within the existing system.\n\nBut Paul may now be politically vulnerable. Were a national security issue to arise, his critics could argue he was the roadblock to preventing the act\u2019s passage. It\u2019s a vulnerability he acknowledges.\n\nOn the Senate floor, he suggested, \u201cSome of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.\u201d\n\n\u2014With additional reporting by Alexa Corse.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:26.230+0000"}
{"entityId": 1933, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It\u2019s not wildly popular anymore, and there\u2019s no real political imperative for a Democrat to back it. Are you listening, Madame Secretary?\n\nMichael Cavadias is a writer and Democratic Party activist in New York City. He has worked for and organized fundraisers for The Campaign to End the Death Penalty and New Yorkers Against The Death Penalty.\n\nHillary Clinton is running for president. She\u2019s hired a lot of very important people. They\u2019ve raised a lot of money for her. Everyone knows she\u2019s running, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, and former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley, each of whom is making political gesticulations to her left, most notably on economic policy.\n\nDemocratic primary voters will be paying excruciatingly close attention to whatever economic moves Clinton might make in the populist direction. There is, however, another issue dividing the progressive wing of the Democratic Party from the centrist Clintonian wing, which so far is getting no attention: capital punishment. The base is ambivalent, and has been for decades. Abolitionists were ascendant in the 1960s and 1970s; proponents made a significant comeback in the 1990s. Today, support for executions among the Democratic base is dwindling, verging on outright revulsion, in the shadow of several highly publicized botched executions.\n\nHillary\u2019s record of support for capital punishment is long, and it\u2019s something she\u2019s used as a political wedge. But next year could get complicated for her if other candidates decide to make an issue of her position.\n\nIn the final hours of his governorship, O\u2019Malley commuted the sentences of the last four death row inmates in Maryland to life without parole, which followed his signing of a bill to repeal the state\u2019s death penalty, on May 2, 2013\u2014something he worked for years to pass into law. These actions reflected his personal convictions, and were also deliberate preparation for a possible run for the Democratic nomination for President next year.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t so long ago that actions like these would have been seen as disqualifying. Sure, one could win Democratic primary votes being opposed to the death penalty, but it was considered general election suicide, especially after Michael Dukakis\u2019s disastrous answer to Bernard Shaw\u2019s question about capital punishment in a 1988 debate.\n\nDukakis was the last Democratic nominee to oppose capital punishment Only a few years after Dukakis\u2019 run, executions were once again in vogue among the party\u2019s leaders. Dukakis became a cautionary tale of what happens to Democrats who can\u2019t prove they are as tough as Republicans on crime. But was it really that Dukakis opposed executions, or that he simply gave a tone-deaf answer to a question that required a deft show of compassion, outrage, and ultimately reason? Whatever the answer, Dukakis\u2019 misstep proved influential on Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign, in which he highlighted his support of capital punishment, as did Hillary.\n\nThe 2016 primary campaign could be the first opportunity in a generation for progressives to make support for capital punishment an issue.\n\nPolitics is full of craven politicians who toss aside principles in favor of expediency. But Bill Clinton\u2019s behavior in the case of Ricky Ray Rector is particularly disturbing. Everyone remembers\u2014how Clinton decided to approve the execution during the heat of the New Hampshire primary as the Gennifer Flowers scandal was brewing around him, how the brain-damaged Rector left his dessert in his cell as he was taken to his death, telling the guards that he was \u201csaving it for later.\u201d Later, as president, Clinton went on to sign the \u201cAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996,\u201d which severely restricted death row inmates\u2019 access to habeas corpus proceedings. This augmented the 1994 crime bill, which expanded the list of federal death penalty crimes from only a handful to over 60, contributing to the highest execution rate in the modern era of American capital punishment.\n\nPerhaps because of this ambitious slate of executions, Democratic support of capital punishment abated, slowly, near the end of the decade, particularly in light of the release of several death row inmates who were proven innocent by exculpatory evidence, such as DNA testing. The most famous of these cases was Anthony Porter, who was set for execution in 1999, but who was exonerated just over 48 hours before his sentence was carried out. This prompted Illinois Governor, George Ryan\u2014notably a Republican\u2014to issue a state moratorium on executions. He eventually commuted the sentences of everyone on Illinois death row to life in prison. Six more states abolished capital punishment between 2007 and 2013.\n\nAll these changes in public perceptions of the death penalty took place against the backdrop of a sustained, national drop in crime. In 2004, John Kerry was the first nominee since Dukakis to oppose the death penalty. In fact, during one of the debates Kerry proudly voiced his opposition to executions, citing his experience in Vietman, saying \u201cI know something about killing. I don\u2019t like killing. I don\u2019t think a state honors life by turning around and sanctioning killing.\u201d Kerry lost of course, but his opposition to the death penalty was barely mentioned by the Bush campaign and was not seen as a contributing factor in his defeat. And although Barack Obama supports executions in very limited circumstances, he does so to a much lesser extent than most recent Democratic standard-bearers have, and it\u2019s barely been an issue.\n\nWhere does this leave Hillary Clinton? Her publicly stated position is unchanged. She supports the death penalty. But a candidate like O\u2019Malley, who\u2019s running as a strong anti-death penalty campaign, might prompt voters to question her commitment to human rights. In the past, Democrats have given pro-death penalty candidates a pass on the grounds that it\u2019s a necessary position to win general elections. But with low crime rates and ever-declining support for capital punishment, that should be less true in 2016.\n\nThus, the 2016 primary campaign could be the first opportunity in a generation for progressives to make support for capital punishment an issue. And thanks to Elizabeth Warren, who has rattled the Clinton camp with her economic populism, the Democratic base is now emboldened and willing to demand more of their candidates.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that the base has largely ignored capital punishment in recent presidential cycles. They want to win elections, and are therefore pragmatic. However, the current political landscape is one in which a candidate can be both pragmatic and oppose the death penalty.\n\nMake no mistake, the Democratic base does care about the death penalty. It might have been put on the back burner for practical reasons in the past. But with issues around police brutality, mass incarceration, sentencing reform, and social justice motivating activists around the country, it\u2019s becoming more and more of a risk for candidates like Clinton to ignore this, and riskier still if candidates and interest groups actually stand up to hold her accountable.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:26.536+0000"}

Republicans\u2019 job: make sure America knows.\n\nOne of these Clintons is not like the other.\n\nAs the Hillary Clinton presidential campaign behemoth gets seemingly closer to raising itself and beginning its plod toward its great Philadelphia coronation, Republicans are giddy at the prospect of being able to remind Americans about the return of Clintonism. They should stop it, now, for three reasons.\n\nFirst, while many Republicans never liked Bill Clinton and do not have universally positive memories of the mid- to late-90\u2019s, many Americans\u2014including conservatives and libertarians\u2014 look back on that period with fondness and nostalgia.\n\nSecond, too few Americans are or were then sufficiently politically engaged or news-addicted to remember the Clinton drama (aside from the Lewinsky scandal) that so many Republicans and media figures warn is already returning, much less treat it as a top priority.\n\nBut third, and most importantly, tying Hillary Clinton to her husband is an act of political malpractice that ignores the fact that on economic issues, she was\u2014during his presidency, during her 2008 campaign, and still today\u2014significantly to the left of him.\n\nFor whatever else one may say about him, Bill Clinton was and is a centrist. His presidency is remembered for the taming of the deficit, his advocacy for free trade, his signature of welfare reform, his legislation cutting the long-term capital gains tax rate, and perhaps most famously, his declaration that \u201cthe era of big government is over.\u201d\n\nThat would not have been true if Hillary had had it her way. And if she has her way now\u2014and if she makes it to the White House\u2014a very un-Bill-like big government will remain in the cards for some time. Leon Panetta, who served as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and then Chief of Staff during the earlier Clinton years, writes in his 2014 book that Hillary Clinton \u201cpicked at [the Clinton administration\u2019s] economic program\u201d of deficit reduction, \u201casking why there wasn\u2019t more room for health care reform or other initiatives.\u201d Panetta apparently felt that such \u201cinitiatives\u201d would have proved too expensive, and would have undermined efforts to slash the deficit.\n\nMoreover, after Bill Clinton passed his first budget, Hillary apparently opposed treating welfare reform as the next priority, again pushing for health care reform. Panetta also details this in his book, and it is significant given what we know about Hillary Clinton\u2019s views on health care.\n\nEven as Hillary had begun trashing the NAFTA agreement and was set to continue to do so, Bill confirmed that he still supported it.\n\nHer Hillarycare proposal, as it was dubbed in the 90\u2019s, was a textbook example of government overreach that proved politically unviable. Obamacare, which remains loathed by so many across America, much more closely resembles the version of health care reform that Hillary Clinton advocated during her 2008 presidential run than that pushed by then-candidate Obama.\n\nIt may surprise those who have recently joined the political game to know that candidate Obama\u2019s plan was decidedly smaller-government and less interventionist than Clinton\u2019s, and that his was swapped for hers once Obama entered the White House. But that is a fact that cannot be avoided, though Hillaryland may in due course try to convince voters otherwise.\n\nDuring Hillary\u2019s failed 2008 presidential run, she explicitly pledged to increase the federal government\u2019s role in the economy, presenting a contrast against her husband\u2019s record and approach. In a late January 2008 interview with The New York Times, she talked up an \u201ceffective, vigorous government.\u201d She also appeared dismissive of opposition to confiscatory taxation, speaking of the \u201cnostalgia and pride\u201d with which Americans look back on the period just after World War II, when the highest marginal tax rates ran above 90 percent.\n\nAs of 2007, Hillary Clinton was on record opposing future free trade agreements and calling for an overhaul of NAFTA, one of Bill Clinton\u2019s signature accomplishments. In a November 2007 CNN debate in Las Vegas, she called NAFTA a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\nThis was interesting, given that even as Hillary had begun trashing the agreement and was set to continue to do so, Bill confirmed that he still supported it, and said in a September 2007 interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that knowing everything he knew then, he would still have tried to pass it. Contrary to Hillary\u2019s claims, Bill said, NAFTA had not hurt American workers.\n\nMore recently, Hillary and Bill have appeared to disagree over the Keystone XL pipeline. In 2012, the State Department, then headed by Hillary, \u201crecommended to President Obama that the presidential permit for the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline be denied and that at this time, the TransCanada Keystone XL Pipeline be determined not to serve the national interest.\u201d Shortly thereafter, Bill Clinton went on record saying of Keystone XL that \u201cI think we should embrace it.\u201d\n\nAs the Hillary machine revs up and begins its trundle towards Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Nevada, and beyond, expect to read more about the differences between the two Clintons. Hillary may benefit politically from leveraging her husband\u2019s record, reputation and rhetorical skills, all of which remain more an asset to her than a liability. But on all of these counts, one of these Clintons is not like the other. Republicans would be smart to ensure the country comes to understand that, sooner rather than later.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:26.866+0000"}

So far, at least, it looks like she was right, and that Bush is just an awful candidate.\n\nHere\u2019s a thought experiment for you. Imagine you could find a person who didn\u2019t know 1) who Jeb Bush was or 2) what pursuit he was involved in. You showed the person a video clip of a Bush press conference or speech, but with the sound turned down, and you asked the person, just based on the expression on Bush\u2019s face and the hang of his shoulders and whatnot, where is this man, and what is he doing?\n\nI think your person would say something like: \u201cWell...he looks like he\u2019s at a funeral. Attending the funeral of a friend\u2019s mother. Or maybe not even a friend. Maybe a co-worker, or employee. He didn\u2019t know the woman. But he\u2019s there, because he needs to be, and he\u2019s paying his respects. \u2018I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. I\u2019m sure she was a wonderful woman.\u2019 He\u2019s doing his duty, but he also looks like he\u2019d really rather be somewhere else.\u201d\n\nBush has a lot of problems, which have become excruciatingly evident this week as he\u2019s managed to offend Latinos and Asians and women (again) while still making no apparent headway with the kinds of people you\u2019re supposed to make headway with by offending the aforementioned. But when you get right down to it, this is his problem. The Donald pegged him. He is a \u201clow-energy person.\u201d He looks like he has only the barest minimum interest in doing this.\n\nOn some level, politics is all about the gene. John Ellis doesn\u2019t have it.

Say what you will about Dubya, and trust me, I said most of it at one time or another. But he had the gene. He liked politics. He enjoyed campaigning. He pinned his shoulders back up on stage, stood erect, gazed upon the crowd with something you might call command. Remember that smirk? Oh God how liberals hated that smirk! I remember how people on my side used to carry on about it, how it betrayed exactly the kind of shoot-first cowboy braggadocio that liberals find repulsive\u2014and indeed, that ended up fucking up a big part of the world to this day. So we were right about that smirk. But at least he was smiling. At least he was up there having fun.\n\nBut Jeb. Yeesh. What\u2019s he doing out there? It\u2019s just duty. And not family duty either. Remember, his mom said he shouldn\u2019t do it. His wife seems cool on it. At best. So it\u2019s not family. It\u2019s mostly party duty. Duty to the money people. Class duty.\n\nWatching him I sometimes wonder: How did this guy get to be a governor? One thing I\u2019ve learned in my years of covering politics, one of the more surprising things, I would say, is just how many utter mediocrities become governors. This is understandable in a lot of those puny states out there where the competition ain\u2019t so great. And where either one party or the other is clearly dominant. So if you\u2019re a Republican state legislator in Wyoming and you have a little charisma, or a Democratic mayor of Providence who has successfully avoided indictment for eight years, well, you can get to be governor. The road is not laid with many traps.\n\nBut Florida\u2019s a big state. Probably a lot of talent there, comparatively speaking. How did Bush do it? Well, he was elected (1998) at a time when his last name was still a plus. And he was a Republican, and Florida elects Republican governors as a rule\u2014I mean crikey, they\u2019ve twice voted in a guy who swindled the federal government on Medicare, which many voters probably saw as a plus. So that\u2019s all it took. He was a Republican, and his name was Bush.\n\nBut now that his last name is a liability, even (or especially) among GOP primary voters, he has to go out and get it, and the first step in getting it is wanting it, and he doesn\u2019t seem to want it. In fact it looks like he dreads the thought of becoming president. Or is indifferent to it, which might be worse. Candidates have problems that they can fix. But how do you fix that problem?\n\nSo here\u2019s how things seem to be shaping up, maybe. There\u2019s going to be Trump. And then, after the rattle and hum of the first few contests, and the Perrys and Jindals and so forths have gone on their merry ways, there\u2019s going to be one anointed non-Trump, whom the party\u2019s panjandrums decide to get behind collectively in order to stop Trump. And that person is likely to be either Bush or Scott Walker or Marco Rubio or John Kasich. Or maybe someone else. (What\u2019s that I hear you say? Mitt Romney? Not, at this point, an insane idea. Think about it.)\n\nThe non-Trump should easily and clearly have been Bush. And it still could be. I notice that still this week, even while Bush is getting slagged by everybody, the political futures market continues to rate him the favorite for the Republican nomination. So the wisdom of the crowd still says Bush, but we sense that it\u2019s said in the same way that people might say \u201cNew England\u201d or \u201cSeattle\u201d when asked who\u2019ll win next year\u2019s Super Bowl. The answer doesn\u2019t reflect thought and analysis, just resigned reflex.\n\nSo he could still be the nominee, and by definition that means he could still be the next president. But as of now, he looks to have the makings of being one of the biggest flops in the history of presidential politics. A year ago all the experts thought otherwise, and sometimes the experts are right, but in this case, it\u2019s looking like Mother knew best.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:27.018+0000"}

Thousands are drawn to his unapologetically liberal (even democratic socialist) message at events in Iowa and New Hampshire. In both states he\u2019s closing in or even tied with Hillary Clinton in presidential polls.\n\nSo why on the issue of guns is he parroting wholly inane, sometimes racist talking points from the National Rifle Association?\n\n\u201cIf somebody has a gun and it falls into the hands of a murderer and the murderer kills somebody with a gun, do you hold the gun manufacturer responsible?\u201d he said to Jake Tapper on CNN. \u201cNot any more than you would hold a hammer company responsible if somebody beats somebody over the head with a hammer.\u201d\n\nNow listen to one of the most viciously stupid men in Congress, Representative Louis Gohmert of Texas, a mere few weeks after the Sandy Hook Massacre.\n\n\u201cI refuse to play the game of \u2018assault weapon.\u2019 That\u2019s any weapon. It\u2019s a hammer.\u201d\n\nSanders was defending his vote for a 2005 law that protected gun manufacturers from lawsuits by victims of gun violence in a manner that big corporations in no other sector of the economy have received. It\u2019s the same law that has prevented parents of the Aurora massacre victims from suing the manufacturer who didn\u2019t think twice about selling 4,300 rounds to James Holmes via the Internet without so much as a cursory check. Whether marketing guns to kids or bullets designed specifically to kill cops, there is no getting around the fact that Sanders joined Blue Dog Democrats and right-wing Republicans in giving arms-dealer conglomerates a get-out-of-jail-free card.\n\nMeanwhile, Sanders sells himself as an anti-corporate warrior who tells inconvenient truths, bows to no special interest, and abides no corporate malfeasance. Yet he still defends this breathtakingly corporatist vote. It\u2019s a vote he\u2019d be savaging in every speech, had it been Senator Chuck Schumer voting to provide blanket immunity for Wall Street or Senator Mitch McConnell voting to put a force field around Big Coal.\n\nEven worse, and actually more offensive, was Sanders\u2019s recent response to his support for weak guns laws. It sounds innocent to the untrained ear, but if you follow the debate over gun violence and gun-safety regulations, then right away you\u2019ll have no trouble hearing the dog whistle that usually emerges from the most right wing, racist precincts of Gunistan:\n\n\u201cI come from a state that has virtually no gun control, but the people of my state understand\u2014pretty clearly\u2014that guns in Vermont are not the same as guns in Chicago or guns in Los Angeles. In our state, guns are used for hunting. In Chicago, they\u2019re used for kids in gangs killing other kids or people shooting police officers, shooting down innocent people.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s states like Vermont that fuel Chicago\u2019s gun violence!\n\nIt\u2019s states like Vermont that fuel Chicago\u2019s gun violence! Firearms are illegally sold in Chicago after being legally purchased in neighboring states with little to no regulations. In fact, Sanders\u2019s own Vermonters, whom he claims are above this kind of behavior, notoriously use the state\u2019s lax firearms laws to ship guns into Boston and New York City (often in return for drugs).\n\nThat doesn\u2019t even touch the astronomical suicide rates plaguing rural America and disproportionately high rural in Vermont, because of this easy gun access. You\u2019d think a progressive with a passion for health care and improving his constituents\u2019 lives would care deeply about that.\n\nOf course, the worst part of this answer is the blatantly racist mention of \u201cChicago,\u201d the go-to city (honorable mentions to Detroit and Washington, D.C.) for the far right ever since a certain half-Kenyan left that city and moved into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Birmingham, Alabama and Jacksonville, Florida, just to name two of many cities, have much worse gun homicide rates, but they just don\u2019t have that certain something that brings Chicago into so many conversations like this.\n\n\u201cIf we burned every Confederate Flag today, would they stop shooting each other in Chicago?\u201d asked NRA board member and pants-pooper-for-freedom (from serving in Vietnam), Ted Nugent.\n\nSanders, in discussing gun violence in America, has said he can bring the \u201ctwo extremes\u201d together. Yes, \u201cextremes.\u201d As if some guy living in a bunker, recycling his own urine and surrounded by enough weaponry to reenact Antietam, is the equivalent of a mom who wants background checks, an assault-weapons ban, and her kids not have to do \u201cactive shooter\u201d drills in third grade. The \u201cextreme\u201d label is the one that is often applied to Sanders by more conservative Democrats to dismiss his candidacy. You\u2019d think he\u2019d understand that when he does the same, he is using the same propaganda techniques as those he claims to deplore.\n\nThis is not to say there can\u2019t be a debate within the Democratic Party over the role of guns in our society and which regulations should be federal and which should be decided by the states\u2014but that is not what Sanders is doing. He is conflating legitimate objections to gun fetishism with a fantasy crusade against hunters and sportsmen. If this tactic is familiar, it is because it is what the NRA does all the time (see \u201cObama planning to ban guns\u201d).\n\nAt a July 9 town hall meeting in Arlington, Virginia, potential Sanders supporter Honora Laszlo, of Moms Demand Action, noticed this.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s using phrases that the gun extremists and the NRA use, saying things like it\u2019s about people not liking guns\u2026 A lot of us are super Bernie Sanders supporters and we were all really disappointed that he could talk about it this way.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t know why Sanders is aping the NRA in his rhetoric, only that he is. That it has cost him the support of many anti-gun violence activists, and certainly hasn\u2019t helped his appeal to minority voters, whose support he needs to grow exponentially if he is to have any chance of winning the Democratic nomination.\n\nDon\u2019t \u201cbring us to the middle\u201d on guns, Senator Sanders, just have an honest conversation about their role in our society, in your own words, and not that of a virulently right-wing corporate lobby. If you think Scandinavia has economics figured out, as you\u2019ve said time and again, then it only stands to reason they might have better ideas on how to prevent gun violence, too.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:27.822+0000"}

When they talked in circles, she stayed on topic. When they made no sense, she argued her points coherently. And when the bell rang, alerting her that she had run out of time, she calmly took however long she damn well pleased to finish answering the question, and no one told her to stop.\n\nFiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO, clearly delivered the breakout performance of Thursday\u2019s first primary debate, coming across rather a lot like a front-runner despite her dismal polling, which kept her from the main event, and despite the fact that earlier in the day, she suffered a public embarrassment at the hands of a rival campaign.\n\nAn hour before the debate started, Rand Paul aide Sergio Gor tweeted out a photo of a piece of paper he found in a hotel printer. He teased his followers and asked them to guess whose statement he had found. At the end of the debate a little over two hours later, Fiorina gave that closing statement word-for-word.\n\nIt didn\u2019t seem to shake Fiorina one bit.\n\nHer comments ranged from clich\u00e9\u2014\u201cMost importantly, I think I understand leadership\u201d\u2014to the garbled\u2014\u201cWe need to tear down cyber walls not on a mass basis, but on a targeted basis\u201d\u2014to, at least regarding Donald Trump, cutting. When moderator Martha MacCallum asked about the bombastic ex-reality TV star\u2019s recent ascent in the polls, she took her first big swipe at a fellow Republican.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t get a phone call from Bill Clinton before I jumped in the race,\u201d she said dryly, looking around the stage at her fellow contenders. \u201cDid any of you guys get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t give money to the [Clinton] Foundation or donate money to his wife\u2019s Senate campaign,\u201d she continued. (\u201cThey\u2019re friends,\u201d she told reporters after the event was over. \u201cThey\u2019re friends! Bill Clinton\u2019s said that, Hillary Clinton\u2019s said that. They\u2019re friends! So, maybe they were talking as friends. I don\u2019t know.\u201d)\n\nThen she continued, tearing into his frequent flip-flops on policies ranging from immigration to abortion.\n\nFiorina has played it nice thus far in the race\u2014too nice. Tonight, that changed. And by tying the GOP front-runner to Democrats\u2019 front-runner, she made a jab that other Republicans have been too nervous to deliver.\n\nOthers noticed her performance. Governor Rick Perry, during the debate, gave her a rare compliment, saying the nuclear deal with Iran would have been better if she had negotiated for it rather than Secretary of State John Kerry. He isn\u2019t the only prominent politico whose admiration Fiorina secured; immediately after the debate, Chris Wallace and George Will both gave her rave reviews.\n\n\u201cDid any of you guys get a phone call from Bill Clinton? I didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFiorina\u2019s performance stood out on its own, but the lackluster competition made her look even better. From Rick Perry calling the former president \u201cRonald Raven\u201d to Rick Santorum comparing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling on same-sex marriage to the Dred Scott decision to Lindsey Graham using just about every question to talk about sending troops to Iraq, the other standouts distinguished themselves for largely the wrong reasons.\n\n\u201cIf you look at state poll after state poll after state poll, I am in the top 10,\u201d a euphoric Fiorina insisted to reporters after the debate was over.\n\n\u201cWe have statewide primaries in this country. I didn\u2019t complain about the rules, but, if you\u2019re gonna pick national polls, what you\u2019re really mentioning is name-ID, and I have the lowest name-ID, still\u2014although, maybe it got better tonight!\u2014still, of any candidate running. So I have to keep introducing myself to the American people. I\u2019m working as hard as I can work, a lot harder than a lot of other folks, according to many observers, and I\u2019m gonna keep working.\u201d\n\nFiorina\u2019s insistence that statewide polls weren\u2019t given enough consideration in the decision-making process for the debates, coupled with her star-turn, left some wondering if she was subtly lobbying for the rules to be changed next time around.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019m not in charge of the rules for the next debate, OK? And I don\u2019t know what will come. But what I know is this: If you look at where primaries are held, week, by week, by week\u2014if people know who I am they like who I am. That\u2019s what the polls say week, by week, by week. And that\u2019s how you win elections.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would have loved to have spent more time talking about the economy. I actually wasn\u2019t asked a question about the economy at all! And certainly I have a lot of experience and a lot to say about that.\u201d\n\nA reporter in the scrum circling Fiorina shouted over the noise, \u201cI have good news for you!\u201d With a laugh, she said, \u201cYou have good news for me! OK!\u201d Since the debate, he told her, she was being searched on Google so much that she rivaled Donald Trump. She smiled confidently. \u201cWell, there ya go.\u201d\n\nAsked if she thought she won the debate, Fiorina smiled.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll let others decide that.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:28.064+0000"}

On social media, he branded those behind the proposed Ground Zero Mosque \u201cterrorists.\u201d And in his capacity as executive director of the American Center for Law and Justice, televangelist Pat Robertson\u2019s snake oil mega-mall of right-wing legal causes, he has lobbied foreign governments to ban homosexuality and fought efforts to allow exceptions to anti-abortion laws when the life of the mother is at risk.\n\nAnd on Friday, he announced he\u2019s going to work for Jeb Bush.\n\nThat\u2019s right, Sekulow will be a senior adviser to the political action committee of the likely Republican presidential candidate most often labeled a moderate.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bush knows how to take bold conservative ideas and put them into action,\u201d Sekulow said in a statement provided to the Christian Broadcasting Network. \u201cI am excited to begin a conversation with conservatives about Governor Bush\u2019s pro-life, pro-family, tax-cutting record in Florida and the ideas we need to put into action to give every American a chance to rise up.\u201d\n\nWhile Bush has not endorsed Sekulow\u2019s extreme anti-gay position, Salon\u2019s Luke Brinker notes that he also has not \u201cstaked out positions substantially at odds with those taken by Sekulow and the ACLJ.\u201d\n\nUntil this point, Bush\u2019s hires have done nothing but bolster his moderate reputation\u2014especially on the issue of marriage equality.\n\nExpected to run Bush\u2019s campaign is David Kochel, a vocal marriage equality advocate who ran Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 campaign in Iowa; the communications director for Bush\u2019s PAC, Right to Rise, is Tim Miller, who is openly gay; The New York Times reported on February 4 that Bush\u2019s longtime adviser, Sally Bradshaw, \u201curged\u201d her former pastor to continue to speak in favor of same-sex marriage.\n\nLargely because of this, on February 26, Buzzfeed\u2019s McKay Coppins declared Bush \u201c2016\u2019s Gay-Friendly Republican.\u201d\n\nBush didn\u2019t seem to like that.\n\n\u201cGovernor Bush knows how to take bold conservative ideas and put them into action,\u201d political adviser Jordan Sekulow.\n\nThe following day Bush spoke at CPAC where, shifting his weight nervously from foot to foot, he told Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity \u201cI believe in traditional marriage.\u201d Two weeks later, Time\u2019s Zeke Miller reported Kochel \u201chas stepped back from his outspoken role in support of same-sex marriage as he prepares to lead the presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nBut this right field hire addresses a problem for Bush.\n\nAs soon as he declared he was \u201cactively exploring\u201d a presidential campaign, observers wondered if Bush was conservative enough.\n\nBesides gay marriage\u2014which he has consistently opposed, though he has, in recent years, adopted a more sympathetic tone when discussing the issue\u2014Bush stands in opposition to the far-right on Common Core and immigration reform.

At a rally for over 700 people in the town of Independence, the Ohio governor said of his New Jersey counterpart that, \u201camong all the governors, he\u2019s my best friend.\u201d The audience let out a collective \u201cawww.\u201d The two were shown the next day on the front of the Cleveland Plain Dealer, shoulder-to-shoulder, beaming.\n\nA few weeks later, Christie was back in the Midwest, this time campaigning for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who was locked in a tight re-election battle.\n\nThis time though, the reaction was more \u201cooooooh,\u201d rather than \u201cawwww.\u201d\n\n\u201cChris is coming because he asked if he could come,\u201d Walker said when asked about the visit. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to say no. We\u2019re not looking for surrogates.\u201d\n\nThe Republican race for the GOP nomination is in its earliest days. And for the most part, the candidates have observed Ronald Reagan\u2019s 11th Commandment: \u201cThou Shall Not Speak Ill of Any Republican.\u201d\n\nThat is, except for Walker.\n\nFour days after winning re-election last November, Walker took shots at Kasich, who had bucked conservative orthodoxy by pushing through a Medicaid expansion, citing St. Peter and his Christian faith.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably not fair to ask the son of a preacher to use biblical metaphors. My reading of the Bible finds plenty of reminders that it\u2019s better to teach someone to fish than to give them fish if they\u2019re able,\u201d Walker said at the time. \u201cCaring for the poor isn\u2019t the same as taking money from the federal government to lock more people into Medicaid.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans see Walker\u2019s willingness to throw elbows as the natural outgrowth of someone who has been climbing up the greasy political pole since he was 22, first as an assemblyman, then as Milwaukee County executive and governor.\n\nWalker has been busy tossing these types of bricks for a while now. When asked about Jeb Bush, for example, he told a New Hampshire interviewer, \u201cTo beat a name from the past, we need a name from the future.\u201d At CPAC, Walker told the crowd how he, \u201cthe son of a small-town preacher,\u201d visited Independence Hall in Philadelphia as an adult because he never had a chance to go as a kid. \u201cThat was a double-knock on Bush, the son and brother of former presidents, who once chaired the National Constitution Center\u2014down the street from Independence Hall,\u201d The Washington Post reported.\n\nIn fact, Walker has been knocking his fellow Republicans for years. During the 2012 campaign, he regularly criticized Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign, saying that Romney was too cautious and needed to show \u201cfire in the belly.\u201d Back in 2013, he was publicly suggesting that the next Republican nominee should be a governor before Congressman Paul Ryan, his fellow Wisconsinite and Romney\u2019s running mate, had announced whether he would run.\n\nAs his polls showed his own re-election a toss-up, Walker and his allies went public with criticism that the Republican Governors Association was failing to send enough donations to Wisconsin\u2014even though the RGA, which Christie chaired, had spent $8 million on his re-election, on top of nearly $9 million the group had spent two years before to help him fend off a recall.\n\n\u201c[Walker] is always in campaign mode\u2014always,\u201d said one Ohio Republican political operative, who added that some Walker allies were reaching out to political operatives in Ohio even before the midterms were over.\n\nAn aide to another Republican governor said, \u201cThe Republican class of governors in 2010, I always felt like we were already pretty much working together and on the same team. Walker seemed to view everybody else as a potential adversary.\u201d\n\nMany Republicans see Walker\u2019s willingness to throw elbows as the natural outgrowth of someone who has been climbing up the greasy political pole since he was 22, first as an assemblyman, then as Milwaukee County executive and governor.\n\n\u201cHe is an aggressive politician, I don\u2019t think there is any doubt about that,\u201d said Jeff Mayers, editor of WisPolitics.com, which covers the state\u2019s political scene. \u201cIf there is an opening, he is not afraid to go in there and fill it.\u201d\n\nMayers said he noted a shift in Walker after he prevailed in his fight with the public-sector unions and then became the first governor in history to survive a recall. Those battles, he said, \u201chardened his edge. He has always been aggressive, but I think he saw then that he could succeed without getting much more than 50 percent of the vote.\u201d\n\nBut other Wisconsin politicos say that Walker has long operated at his own political speed.\n\nDavid Riemer ran against Walker when he sought re-election as Milwaukee County executive in 2004. In that race, the Walker campaign ran ads accusing Riemer of engineering a city pension settlement that cost taxpayers millions of dollars. The pension settlement actually saved the county some $20 million, Riemer said, a fact that the city comptroller and city attorney backed up. According to a newspaper account at the time, Walker refused to pull the spots, even as \u201che again conceded that the ad\u2019s assertion is not correct as stated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat kind of person admits that they are wrong but won\u2019t change what they are doing,\u201d asked Riemer when reached by phone this week. \u201cHis main goal has been to get into higher office and then use that to get into even higher office.\u201d\n\nOther candidates have much been more hesitant to go on the attack. When Jeb Bush was asked, for example, about Walker\u2019s recent flip-flops on immigration, he deflected and deflected until reporters followed him out of a campaign stop and told him that Walker had admitted changing his opinion on the issue.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s changed his views on immigration, yes,\u201d Bush, said, concurring with Walker\u2019s own opinion.\n\nWhen Marco Rubio was asked about Bush, he declined to criticize him, calling him \u201ca very credible candidate\u201d and praising his fundraising abilities. When Rand Paul entered the presidential race, Ted Cruz called him \u201ca good friend\u201d whose entry into the race will \u201chelp make us all stronger.\u201d Mike Huckabee is on the record with high praise for Rick Perry and one-time candidate Mitt Romney.\n\nIf any of the GOP contenders seem willing to push back Walker\u2019s comments so far, it is Kasich, who, while he may not be the son of a preacher like Walker, wanted to be a priest when he was a boy and whose parents were killed in car accident by a drunk driver in 1987. Often in profiles, Kasich is portrayed as growing most animated when he is compared to the Midwestern governor, who has shot far ahead of him in early state polls.\n\nWhen, for example, a New York Times reporter mentioned that many people think Walker is more conservative, Kasich \u201cbolted upright. \u2018I think I have the right to define what conservatism is,\u2019\u201d he roared, launching an 11-minute defense of his record.

Was Donald Trump really in favor of single-payer healthcare?\n\nBy Louis Jacobson, Linda Qiu and Katie Sanders\n\n\n\nJust four days before the first primetime debate of the 2016 cycle, famously blunt GOP frontrunner Donald Trump portrayed himself Sunday as the target of vicious attacks from his competition.\n\nBut it didn\u2019t take long in an interview, one of three he gave by phone, for Trump to insult one figure who definitely won\u2019t be on stage Thursday: President Barack Obama.\n\nABC This Week\u2019s Jonathan Karl asked Trump about comments on Twitter in November that Obama has done \u201csuch a poor job as president, you won\u2019t see another black president for generations.\u201d\n\nTrump explained that Obama failed African-Americans:\n\n\u201cYou look at what's gone on with their income levels. You look at what's gone on with their youth. I thought that he would be a great cheerleader for this country. I thought he'd do a fabulous job for the African-American citizens of this country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe has done nothing. They are worse now than just about ever. ... They have problems now in terms of unemployment numbers. \u2026 Here you have a black president who's done very poorly for the African-Americans of this country.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s claim that African-Americans are in a worse spot \u201cnow than just about ever\u201d in terms of income and unemployment levels rates False.\n\nTrump is wrong by several economic measures.\n\nThe African-American unemployment rate when Obama entered office was 12.7 percent. By June 2015, it had fallen to 9.5 percent, a drop of about one-quarter. And compared to its Obama-era peak of 16.8 percent in March 2010, the unemployment rate has fallen by about 43 percent.\n\nBut what about a longer historical look? The black unemployment rate was higher than its current rate between May 1974 and June 1997, and between November 2001 and June 2005. In all, since May 1974, black unemployment was higher than today\u2019s rate in 328 months, and lower than today\u2019s rate in 87 months. So it\u2019s been higher than today 79 percent of the time since May 1974. So Trump's point here is wrong.\n\nThe pattern is similar for the unemployment rate of African-Americans ages 16-24, down from 31 percent in June 2009 to 23.4 percent in June 2015. Historically, the rate has been higher than the most recent rate 84 percent of the time in 43 years.\n\nTrump is still incorrect even when using one of Obama\u2019s weaker statistics: the black poverty rate. The poverty rate rose from 25.8 percent in 2009 to 27.2 percent in 2013, the most recent year available. That\u2019s about 5 percent higher than it was when Obama took office, and it\u2019s also higher than at any time prior to the Obama presidency going back to 1996. Still, today\u2019s higher black poverty rate is hardly unprecedented: It was higher than it is now between 1959 and 1996 \u2014 a 38-year period.\n\nHousehold median income for African-Americans shows a similar pattern to the poverty rate: Inflation-adjusted incomes have worsened during Obama\u2019s tenure, but they are hardly the worst rates in history.\n\nWhile Trump was attacking the president, one of his competitors just outside the 10-person debate cutoff took a last-effort punch at the loud guy in the lead.\n\nFormer Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has been trading jabs with Trump in recent weeks, stood by his critique of Trump as a \u201ccancer on conservatism,\u201d saying on Fox News Sunday that Trump doesn\u2019t share Republican principles.\n\n\u201cHe's for single-payer. I mean, how can anyone who is a conservative stand up and say, \u2018I am for a single-payer for health care,\u2019 \u201d Perry said. \u201cI mean, that is anathema for my perspective of an individual who wants to have the banner of the Republican Party, the banner of conservatism.\u201d\n\nThe claim rates Half True.\n\nDuring his short-lived 2000 Reform Party presidential bid, Trump supported universal health care without ambiguity, and he voiced support for a single-payer system in several instances.\n\n\"The Canadian plan also helps Canadians live longer and healthier than America. \u2026 We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing,\" Trump writes in his 2000 book The America We Deserve.\n\nThe problem for Perry\u2019s claim is that it suggests this is Trump\u2019s current position, and that is far less clear.\n\nOver the past few months, Trump has said he admires Scotland\u2019s single-payer system and dissed the Affordable Care Act as incompetently implemented.\n\nIn a July radio interview, Trump avoided his previous position and instead talked about a totally different approach. Calling himself a \"conservative with a heart,\" he described his alternative to the Affordable Care Act as being \"great (private) plans\" made through \"deals with hospitals\" that allow the government to help people \"at the lower levels.\"\n\nA Trump spokesman denied that the candidate supported \"socialized medicine\u201d but is for \"a universal \u2018market-based\u2019 plan that would offer a range of choices.\"\n\nHealth care experts said that sounds a lot like, well, Obamacare.\n\nOther than that, the Trump campaign has been silent about what his specific health care policies are. Whether Trump reveals more about his health care policy may come in Thursday\u2019s debate.\n\nStaff writers Will Cabaniss and Jon Greenberg contributed to this report.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:28.888+0000"}
{"entityId": 1941, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why the Donald\u2019s comments about John McCain\u2019s war record are unlikely to sink him.\n\nThe conventional wisdom of course is that Trump cooked his goose with that John McCain comment, and every so often the c.w. turns out to be right, as it might in this case. Republican base voters love their war heroes, provided they didn\u2019t come home and oppose the war and throw their medal over a fence, in which case it\u2019s OK to lie about them and smear their reputation; otherwise it\u2019s always been kind of an accepted chestnut that you don\u2019t talk smack about the military to Republicans.\n\nSo maybe he stepped in the quicksand here. But I think it\u2019s worth wondering: What if he didn\u2019t? What if, that is, he doesn\u2019t plummet in the polls? What if the near-universal presumption in the political media that this is the beginning of the end winds up being more about media presumptions about how the GOP base thinks than, you know, how that base actually thinks? I believe there\u2019s a sporting enough chance that this is the case that it\u2019s certainly worth a column, so here I go.\n\nLet\u2019s start here. What\u2019s brought Trump to the top of the GOP heap? Obviously, it\u2019s his relentless and unhinged caterwauling about immigration. Some punditry I\u2019ve noticed has tried to sugarcoat this, or note Trump\u2019s universal name recognition. But he had universal name recognition when he was at 5 percent. Two weeks of talk about Mexican rapists and this alleged plot of the Mexican government to \u201csend us\u201d all their criminals has vaulted him to the top of the Republican field. As I write this, in fact, the new ABC/Washington Post poll , which was taken Thursday through Sunday, has Trump with 24 percent of the vote, compared to 13 percent for Walker and 12 percent for Bush.\n\nThere is no mystery here. Conservative Republican base voters hate undocumented immigration as much as they hate anything. So many hot buttons get pushed. So Trump couldn\u2019t have chosen a better issue. But it hasn\u2019t been just the issue; it\u2019s the blunt way he talks about it. Because he is being so flagrantly and (to the base\u2019s eyes) delightfully anti-politically correct. He\u2019s rubbing the shit in everybody\u2019s face, right up into their nostrils. They love this.\n\nSo that\u2019s that. But now this primal urge collides head on with another one, the deep pro-military bias among these kinds of voters. This ardor is longer held, and it is more easily and widely understood by, oh, political reporters, for example. But is it definitely stronger than the anti-immigrant ardor?\n\nThe answer is, we don\u2019t know. I would argue that fear and loathing are generally better motivators in politics than love and enthusiasm, so I\u2019d say yes, anti-immigrant anger probably trumps, so to speak, pro-military passion.\n\nSo here\u2019s my prediction, and if I\u2019m wrong, it won\u2019t be the first time or the last, but: I think Trump will lose about three points over this.\n\nBut let\u2019s say I\u2019m wrong about that for the sake of argument. Even so, the assumption that Trump\u2019s comment will kill him itself seems to rest on an assumption: that pro-military passion equals and is indistinguishable from pro-John McCain fervor. And that is what I\u2019m not sure is the case at all.\n\nNow, it might be the case that because of Trump\u2019s exact phrasing (\u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured\u201d) his statement can be universalized from McCain to every veteran who was captured. If it plays out like that, maybe Trump has big problems. But if this is just a Trump vs. McCain thing, it\u2019s not hard to see how Trump could skate through.\n\nFirst of all, McCain is yesterday\u2019s news. He\u2019s a month away from turning 80. He\u2019s certainly still relevant as a senator, but that isn\u2019t the question. The question is whether an attack on him incites the GOP base to rise up in his defense. A very open question. Remember, the base voters didn\u2019t like him much in 2008. He had to put Sarah Palin on his ticket to assuage them.\n\nIf Trump had disparaged Iraq war veterans as a group, or the U.S. military as a thing, then sure, he\u2019d probably be cooked. But that isn\u2019t what he did. He mocked a particular human being\u2014and, at that, a human being whose relationship to the base is complicated. Even now, McCain is already facing a declared primary challenge, assuming he seeks reelection in 2016, from a right-wing state senator who wants you to join her in \u201cnot just go[ing] along with the Beltway crowd.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s my prediction, and if I\u2019m wrong, it won\u2019t be the first time or the last, but: I think Trump will lose about three points over this. And I think even that small diminution will happen less because \u201che attacked a war hero\u201d than because \u201che\u2019s an out-of-control person who really just isn\u2019t the kind of guy who ought to be a major-party presidential nominee.\u201d He is of course going to say more crazy things along these crazy lines, and eventually, as I\u2019ve written before, his act is going to get tired.\n\nBut I say it\u2019s going to take more than this for Trump to fall. The press underestimates the intensity of the conservative base\u2019s feelings on immigration, and it always has. Why isn\u2019t immigration reform law, after 68 senators voted for it (including 14 Republicans) in 2013, and given that we know almost to a certainty that it could have passed the House any day that John Boehner might have chosen to let it come to a vote? The answer: It isn\u2019t law because of the GOP base, period. The Judases who voted for it would all have received primary challenges, and Boehner would have been dumped as speaker.\n\nThe lessons here go beyond Trump. A poll of Latinos came out last week that was just terrible for Republicans. The strongest Republican against Hillary Clinton? Jeb Bush (yep, more than Marco Rubio, by a couple points). But let\u2019s make that \u201cstrongest,\u201d with irony quotes, because Jeb\u2019s number was 27 percent, which is exactly what Mitt Romney got in 2012.\n\nSo nothing in the GOP has changed, and Bush can speak Spanish exclusively for the next few months, and very little is going to change. The GOP\u2019s larger problem, then, isn\u2019t Trump. It\u2019s the people supporting him.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:29.115+0000"}

For some of the most vulnerable, it was too late.\n\nEverything about Rilya Wilson\u2019s death was horrific. She entered the Florida foster system a bright-eyed toddler, and disappeared when she was about 4 years old. And it took the state Department of Children and Families\u2014responsible for vulnerable children like Rilya\u2014two years to realize she was gone.\n\nA witness in an ensuing criminal case said the girl\u2019s caretakers locked her in a dog cage, beat her with switches, and tied her to her bed at night. Authorities never found her body. And an uncontroversial conclusion emerged: that these horrors destroyed Rilya because of the failure of the Florida Department of Children and Families.\n\nJeb Bush was the governor during Rilya\u2019s disappearance and death. Now that he\u2019s campaigning to be president, he talks often about the importance of taking care of society\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nIn his announcement video, he said that his core beliefs \u201cstart with the premise that the most vulnerable in our society should be in the front of the line, not the back.\u201d\n\n\n\nAnd in a June 19 speech to social conservative activists, he mentioned the state\u2019s child welfare system and then said his administration \u201cput the most vulnerable in society at the front of the line, guided by my faith.\u201d\n\nFew are more vulnerable than foster children, and as governor, Bush oversaw some sweeping policy changes that angled to get those kids better care.\n\nAnd though the governor seems to relish all the wonky minutiae of immigration and education policy, he rarely if ever discusses foster care on the trail in any detail (none of the potential presidential candidates do).\n\nBush inherited one of\u2014if not the\u2014worst foster systems in the nation, and he changed it. A lot. But in the state, there\u2019s still deep disagreement over whether or not he rectified the wrongs that let Rilya vanish and die.\n\n\u201cIt has gotten worse over time,\u201d Dr. George Rahaim, a psychologist who worked with the Department of Children and Families,said in May of 2002. \u201cIt is worse now, in my opinion, that it ever has been.\u201d\n\nWhen Bush became governor in 1999, Florida was a horrible place to be a foster child. Timothy Arcaro, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, wrote a detailed and gut-churning paper in 2001 laying out the enormity of the system\u2019s flaws.\n\nIn his report, Arcaro cited one 1998 grand jury report that said, \u201c[T]he problems facing the Department are extensive and so systemic that the children in the custody of or under the protection of the Department are in peril.\u201d\n\nBroward County\u2019s foster care system was particularly bad.\n\n\u201cIn addition to physical, emotional, and mental abuse, foster children in Broward County also suffered sexual victimization,\u201d Arcaro wrote. \u201c[A]n eight-year-old child forced to commit sex acts in foster placement; an eleven-year-old girl lured away by another foster child and then gang-raped by several men; a sexually aggressive teenager placed in a foster home with three younger children subsequently charged with sexually abusing one of the younger children, a four-year-old girl; foster parents gave a child a whistle to blow if older children in the foster home tried to sexually molest him.\u201d\n\nThat grand jury report concluded that the children for whom the Department of Children and Families was responsible were \u201cin peril.\u201d\n\nIn other words, being \u2018protected\u2019 by the DCF was dangerous.\n\nWhen Bush became governor, he made Kathleen Kearney the secretary of the department. And she wasn\u2019t coy about its problems.\n\n\u201cWe are on the Titanic,\u201d Kearney, a former circuit-court judge, told the Sun-Sentinel editorial board. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on it for decades.\u201d\n\nBut the editorial board wasn\u2019t impressed with Kearney\u2019s plan for making things better.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s showing skills better suited for re-arranging deck chairs on her favorite luxury liner,\u201d they opined, concluding that her plans weren\u2019t impressive and that she \u201cmay well become the next DCF secretary to go down with the ship.\u201d\n\nThey were right.\n\nAfter Rilya\u2019s case became a national scandal\u2014Bill O\u2019Reilly tore into Bush over his connection to it\u2014Kearney gave the governor her resignation. At the time, the department didn\u2019t know the whereabouts of 500 of the children supposedly in its care. Comparing it to the Titanic might have been generous.\n\nAnd during Bush\u2019s first years in office, observers said the department\u2019s problems metastasized.\n\n\u201cIt has gotten worse over time,\u201d Dr. George Rahaim, a psychologist who worked with the department, said in May of 2002. \u201cIt is worse now, in my opinion, that it ever has been.\u201d\n\nThe department had an epidemic of caseworkers lying about checking in on the children in their charge. The Miami Herald reported that in the years before 2001, the department\u2019s performance \u201cin virtually every category\u201d got worse, even though its budget had grown.\n\n\u201c[F]oster children continue to be abused at alarming rates,\u201d the paper noted.\n\nObservers couldn\u2019t overstate the situation\u2019s grimness.\n\n\u201cThere is no place in the country where it is worse to be a foster child than Florida,\u201d Richard Wexler, director of the National Coalition for Child Protection Reform, told Time in May of 2002.\n\nBush seems to have known it. Emails show him and staff going back and forth\u2014in a very limited fashion\u2014about foster kids\u2019 deaths. At one point, he forwarded spokeswoman Katie Muniz the text of an AP story about 16 children dying while in the department\u2019s care in 2001.\n\n\u201clet us discuss,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201csigh,\u201d replied Muniz.\n\nTwenty minutes later, he fired back.\n\n\u201cI would like an explanation of this,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIn another email, he told Muniz to have Kearney call him. That phone conversation obviously wasn\u2019t public record\u2014as his emails are\u2014but one could speculate it was tense.\n\nFoster children weren\u2019t without advocates, but their efforts often came up short. In the summer of 2000, children\u2019s rights advocates sued Bush, Kearney, and the Department of Children and Families in federal court. The case, Foster Children Bonnie L. v. Bush, charged that the state showed \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to the children\u2019s rights. The plaintiffs also charged that the department treated black foster children worse than their white counterparts, and put less effort into trying to find them adoptive homes.\n\n\u201cOne toddler from Flagler County is now partially paralyzed after being beaten by a foster parent,\u201d reported the Sun-Sentinel, describing more details of the suit. \u201cTwo sisters from Manatee County were tied by their wrists and ankles to their beds by their adoptive parents and made to sleep on concrete surrounded by a brick cage. A 14-year-old Hillsborough County girl lived for a nearly a year in an overcrowded foster home where children were punished with hot sauce on their tongues and head dunkings in toilets.\u201d\n\nThe suit also said that one plaintiff, 14-year-old Tanya M., shared a bedroom and a single dresser with seven other children and suffered \u201charmful weight loss\u201d because she didn\u2019t get enough to eat. Tanya eventually ended up back with her biological parents, and her father assaulted her and broke her arm. She then went back to an overcrowded shelter, and her caretakers planned to put her in a wilderness program designed as a \u201cmoderate risk delinquency commitment program\u201d\u2014in other words, a program for troublemakers \u2014\u201ceven though she is not delinquent and has not committed any violations of law.\u201d\n\nTanya ran away. She was one missing kid out of hundreds.\n\nUltimately, the United States Florida District Court dismissed most of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims on the grounds of states\u2019 rights, wrote John Pardeck (who was professor emeritus in Missouri State University\u2019s school of social work) in Children\u2019s Rights: Policy and Practice.\n\nThe lawsuit\u2019s small win was a promise from the Department of Children and Families \u201cto reinforce a nondiscriminatory policy toward African Americans and older children,\u201d Pardeck wrote. The attorneys appealed the dismissal of the other charges, but the Supreme Court refused to take the case.\n\nSo Bush won in court. But he knew things still needed to change.\n\nHis predecessor, Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles, had overseen the beginning of a movement toward privatizing the Department of Children and Families, which oversaw foster care.\n\nOn this front, Bush went all in. In a 2001 speech to the Dependency Court Improvement Program Summit, Bush proclaimed that his state was \u201cleading the nation in the quiet revolution of child welfare reform.\u201d\n\nThat revolution doubled the funding for the state\u2019s child welfare services, privatized the state\u2019s entire child welfare service system and subcontracted out the work of caring for foster kids, Robert E. Crew Jr., an associate dean of Florida State University\u2019s College of Social Sciences, wrote in Jeb Bush: Aggressive Conservatism in Florida.\n\nThese actions essentially moved all the responsibility for the provision of child welfare services to the private, nonprofit sector, said Michael Dale, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University in Florida and an expert on juvenile and children\u2019s law.\n\nEach area of the state got a community-based corporation, or lead agency, to provide services, conduct evaluations, provide social workers, and subcontract further with other private providers.\n\nThe state agency\u2019s role shrunk dramatically, limited to contracting with private agencies, conducting oversight of them, providing lawyers for the department to litigate cases involving abuse or neglect, and handling the initial investigations in new cases.\n\nDale said he wasn\u2019t impressed with the outcomes of Bush\u2019s changes and he doesn\u2019t think privatization was the right move.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it was a good idea, because it promised things that didn\u2019t happen,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no evidence that it has succeeded in doing what it was supposed to do.\u201d\n\nOthers defend Bush\u2019s changes. Buddy MacKay, a Democrat who ran against (and lost to) Bush in 1998 and later spent a few months helming the department, praised the governor\u2019s move.\n\n\u201cI think it's one of the finest things that has happened,\u201d he told the Sun-Sentinel in 2011.\n\nAnd that paper reported that Bush\u2019s move to privatization brought good outcomes.\n\n\u201cBy many existing yardsticks, the private agencies are doing better than the state did,\u201d the paper reported in 2011. \u201cAdoptions are up 200 percent, kids are being returned from foster care to their families faster and fewer children are harmed again once they go home, statistics show.\u201d\n\nDale said he\u2019s skeptical of any analysis like that.\n\n\u201cThere have been public changes in policy after every major visible public event,\u201d he said, referring to situations like Rilya\u2019s disappearance and death. \u201cI can tell you that to my knowledge, there has never been an objective evaluation of the impact of any of these things that have been done.\u201d\n\nAnd Rilya\u2019s death was far from the last. In March of 2011, the Palm Beach Post reported that more children\u2019s deaths had spurred debate about the wisdom of a privatized system.\n\nIn February of 2011, 10-year-old Nubia Barahona was found dead in her adopted father\u2019s truck. Her adoptive parents have been indicted but not yet convicted. And the Department of Children and Families has drawn scorching criticism for failing another child.\n\nTwo weeks after Nubia\u2019s death, the bodies of two more kids\u2014Jermaine McNeil and Ju'Tyra Allen\u2014were found. A community-based corporation was responsible for making sure they were safe in their home, but the Palm Beach Post noted that it never ascertained that the children were living with a convicted felon who could have been putting them in danger. The Sun-Sentinel reported that man\u2019s case is underway.\n\nThe reality is that Florida has failed a lot of kids. Though Bush\u2019s oversight and innovative policy-making might have helped protect children, the data isn\u2019t clear. And more vulnerable Sunshine State kids are likely to face the same fates as Rilya, Jermaine, Ju\u2019Tyra, and Nubia.\n\nBut that\u2019s not good campaign trail material.\n\nAdditional reporting by Alexa Corse", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:29.768+0000"}

It\u2019s a bold, politically risky move with the potential to change the debate forever.\n\nIndiana is in the midst of a horrific spike in HIV cases\u201479 cases have been recorded in one county alone\u2014and Governor Mike Pence is breaking with party tradition in his search for a solution. He has announced that the state will initiate an HIV and substance abuse treatment center that will include a short-term needle exchange program \u201cfor the sole purpose of containing the epidemic.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s decision to sanction a short-term needle-exchange program is a major step forward in drug reform\u2014and not just for the Hoosier State. Support from Pence, the former congressman and staunch conservative, could mean the tipping point in a debate that\u2019s plagued the U.S. for two decades.\n\n\u201cThese services are meant to keep people alive.\u201d\n\nDespite mounting scientific evidence that needle exchange programs are effective at reducing HIV among drug users, the federal ban on funding has been in place since 1980. If Pence can help sway others in his party to support the issue, there\u2019s a good chance the ban may be lifted all together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. Great to show Gov. Pence showing leadership on this,\u201d Bill Piper, director of national affairs for the Drug Policy Alliance, told The Daily Beast. \u201cHis actions stand out as being more influential\u2014he has the ability to influence others.\u201d\n\nAt present, Pence\u2019s plan only allows the needle exchange to remain open for 30 days. If prior studies are any indication, Pence may want to extend it.\n\nExperts estimate that IV drug use accounts for 14 percent of cases of HIV among women and up to 11 percent among men\u2014an epidemic that newly infects 50,000 Americans every year. Needles, used to inject drugs into the bloodstream, make an ideal vehicle for HIV. The blood-borne infection can cling either to the needle itself or the drug inside of it. The result puts the 15.9 million people who inject drugs worldwide, 3 million of whom already have it, at great risk of infection.\n\nBut there is a simple remedy: clean needles.\n\nThe first federally funded evaluation of the efficacy of needle-exchange programs took place in New Haven, Connecticut, in late 1998. Using mathematical and statistical data (rather than self-reporting), the researchers found a 33 percent drop in the rate of HIV infections among participants. Since then, more than four dozen studies have been released showing similar results.\n\nThe list of agencies that support the practice is extensive. It includes the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, the American Medical Association, the National Institutes of Health, and the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nBut still, the ban on federal funding for needle-exchange programs lives on. First introduced amid AIDS panic of the 1980s, it was repealed once in 2009 by Democrats, but then quickly reinstated when Republicans took the House in 2011.\n\nCritics of the ban argue that needle-exchange programs not only promote drug use, but increase the likelihood that people will use drugs. Science begs to differ. Multiple reports from the CDC and the National Institute on Drug Abuse have concluded that syringe exchange programs do not increase the incidence of drug use. In 2008, the Surgeon General released a statement confirming this.\n\nKaiser Health estimates that there are at least 221 sterile syringe exchange programs nationwide across 33 states. The programs themselves are simple, providing a place for users to dispose of contaminated needles and obtain sterile syringes for later use.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to run out and do heroin just because they have a syringe,\u201d Piper says. \u201cThe reality is people who are going to use heroin are going to use it.

{"entityId": 1944, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "It\u2019s not just the GOP frontrunner\u2014menophobia, or the fear of menstrual blood, goes all the way back to biblical times.\n\nBy now we have all been caught up in #Bloodgate. Donald Trump\u2019s chauvinistic gaffe about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly menstruating has (slightly) damaged his reputation among Republicans, leading to retracted invitations and the implausible explanation that he was referring to her nose. \u201cI cherish women,\u201d Trump later added.\n\nAs archaic and crass as The Donald is, he\u2019s not the first to see menstruation as a drain on a woman\u2019s intellect. Just this week the Daily Mail censored a picture of London marathon runner Kiran Gandhi, who dared to \u201cfree flow\u201d during the competition. Many of us grew up on menstruation jokes, the punch line of which was \u2018never trust an animal that bleeds for five days and doesn\u2019t die.\u2019 This is not some modern Western hang-up: menophobia (the fear of menstrual blood) is a cross-cultural phenomenon. The sociologist Emile Durkheim actually hypothesized that religion developed as a partial response to the \u201crepulsing action\u201d of menstruation.\n\nIn the Jewish religious imagination, blame for what is actually the primordial \u201ccurse\u201d is often placed squarely on Eve. Eve is seen as responsible for all of the unpleasantness of the reproductive process: menstruation and childbirth included.\n\nIn the ritual regulations that make up the book of Leviticus, menstrual blood turns out to be something of a problem. According to the book\u2019s priestly author, menstruation is a cause of ritual impurity. Not only is a menstruating woman impure for seven days, but anyone who touches her is unclean \u201cuntil the evening\u201d (Lev. 15:19). Sex is squarely out of the question (unless you want to bring seven days of impurity on yourself) and, in the meantime, everything she sits or lies on also becomes unclean. The impurity associated with menstruation\u2014much like the impurity associated with skin diseases or emissions of semen\u2014was communicable through touch.\n\nThe prohibition on contact with menstruating women is not found only in Judaism. The Koran prohibits intercourse during menses (2:222) and the Hindu Laws of Manu indicate that a woman becomes purified from menstruation when she bathes at the conclusion of her period (6:66). Bathing post-period appears to have been the cross-cultural cure-all, but until menses were over women were contagious. Until 2005, Hindu women in Nepal were forced to live in cowsheds during their period. To this day some traditional members of Orthodox Christianity abstain from receiving Holy Communion during menstruation.\n\nBut this is about more than either cleanliness or ritual purity. The idea that menstrual blood poses a health risk is evident in a variety of cultures. The ancient Jewish collection of rabbinic opinions known as the Talmud reads, \u201cIf a menstruant woman passes between two [men], if it is at the beginning of her menses, she will slay one of them, and if it is at the end of her menses, she will cause strife between them\u201d (b. Pesah\u0323. 111a). Watch out, Chris Wallace and Brett Baier.\n\nTrump may not have been one of the Republican nominees who paraded their Christianity around the arena in Cleveland, but there is a religious basis to (this part of) his misogyny.\n\nThe Talmud reads, \u201cIf a menstruant woman passes between two [men], if it is at the beginning of her menses, she will slay one of them \u2026 at the end of her menses, she will cause strife between them.\u201d Watch out, Chris Wallace and Brett Baier.\n\nAnd all of this anxiety about women\u2019s reproductive cycles leaves aside the old wives\u2019 tales about how menstruating women shouldn\u2019t attend funerals, bake bread, or pickle vegetables.\n\nBut why do we obsess over a biological process experienced by the majority of (although not all) women?\n\nPart of it is to do with the way that menstrual blood reminds us that the human body is not hermetically sealed from the world around it. To an extent, as UNC-Charlotte anthropologist Jon Marks told me, \u201cAll bodily fluids are symbolically charged\u2014phlegm, urine, etc. Probably the symbolic ambiguity is that they are both part of you and not part of you simultaneously. Mucus, ear wax, saliva.\u201d At the same time though, \u201cBlood\u2026is sort of in a class by itself, because it indicates so much, from valor, essence, and ancestry to illness and infertility.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that menstruation does not have its advantages, even in religious contexts. Menstruating women can be exempted from the fasting that accompanies Ramadan and, in some cultures, are encouraged to avoid work. In her book Blood Magic: The Anthropology of Menstruation, anthropologist Alma Gottlieb describes how among the Beng people of Cote d\u2019Ivoire, menstruating women are released from work in the fields and instead cook a special sweet palm-nut sauce. The fact that members of the community prize this particular dish suggests that menstruation is not naturally or necessarily taboo.\n\nPerhaps Trump will take solace in the knowledge that, while he\u2019s a throwback to an earlier, Pre-Enlightenment age, he\u2019s hardly alone in finding women\u2019s bodily discharges repulsive. And who knows, perhaps there\u2019s a business opportunity here. Trump Red Tents does have a nice ring to it. While you\u2019re building the wall between us and Mexico, Donald.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:30.322+0000"}
{"entityId": 1945, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The civil rights icon was a kind of proto-Obama until he lost a congressional race to one of his closest allies, the legendary John Lewis.\n\nThere was an Obama before Obama, a black man with the grace, the intellect and the political acumen to overcome prejudice and climb the ladder of electoral politics to its highest rung. Julian Bond, who died on Saturday, was that man. And while he didn\u2019t fulfill the heady expectations of his early rise to national prominence, he and the other civil-rights leaders of his generation\u2014John Lewis, Andy Young, Vernon Jordan\u2014helped pave the way for President Obama.\n\nObama counts himself among the \u201cJoshua generation\u201d charged with bringing their people into the Promised Land. Speaking in Selma, Alabama, at a civil-rights commemoration in March 2007, Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m here because somebody marched. I\u2019m here because you all sacrificed for me. I stand on the shoulders of giants. I thank the Moses generation; but we\u2019ve got to remember, now, that the Joshua generation still has a job to do.\u201d\n\nCool and cerebral, much like Obama, Bond was only in his 20s when he emerged as one of the vibrant young voices of the civil rights movement. He wasn\u2019t an older African-American preacher marching in the streets, although he was the direct beneficiary of what they did. And he had the courage to run for office, which was no small thing in 1965 in Atlanta.\n\n\u201cHe was barely older than I was and he got elected as a black man in Georgia,\u201d marvels Mike McCurry, who was in middle school when he was transfixed watching Bond\u2019s nomination for vice president at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago. Bond humbly declined the honor. He was 28, seven years shy of the 35 years of age required to be president.\n\nShining the light on Bond, if only to imagine what might be possible, produced a rare positive moment in a convention torn apart by the Vietnam War, police clashes in the street, and racial polarization. Bond had come to Chicago leading an alternative delegation from Georgia.\n\nA lot of people in their 60s now were coming of age then, and what they saw in Bond was someone who had the savvy and the smarts to leverage black power within the white power structure. Immediately after President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, Bond ran for the Georgia House, and won. When the legislature refused to seat him because he wouldn\u2019t condemn the symbolic burning of draft cards advocated by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), he took his case all the way to the Supreme Court. He won on free-speech grounds and went on to serve four terms in the Georgia House and six in the Senate.\n\nBond was a celebrity and a popular speaker on college campuses. When a congressional seat opened up in the suburbs of Atlanta in 1986, he was presumed its natural heir. But John Lewis, his close friend and ally, who also had emerged from the civil-rights battles of the 60s as a genuine hero, also threw his hat into the race. In a crowded field, the two men finished at the top, which meant they were then pitted against each other in a run-off.\n\nIt was a bitter race and in a September debate, Bond accused Lewis of accepting an unethical campaign contribution, and Lewis challenged Bond to take a drug test, which he had refused to do. According to Lewis\u2019s 1998 memoir, Walking with the Wind, Bond responded with a \u201cnervous joke about \u2018Star Wars\u2019 and \u2018Jar Wars.\u2019 But no one was laughing,\u201d Lewis wrote. The drug allegation took its toll, and Bond, the presumed golden boy, lost, never to run for public office again.\n\nHe and Lewis reconciled, but it took years. After Bond\u2019s death was reported over the weekend, Lewis tweeted, \u201cWe went through a difficult period during our campaign for Congress in 1986, but many years ago we emerged even closer.\u201d The two men together led a civil rights tour of the South in March of this year.\n\nThe resentments that tore them apart are recounted in Lewis\u2019s memoir, where he wrote, \u201cJulian enjoyed being a star. He approached his work as if it were an inconvenience. Everything had always come easy for Julian; sweating was not something he liked to do.\u201d\n\nYet everyone assumed he would be a \u201cshoo-in\u201d for Congress. \u201cAnd that bothered me a great deal,\u201d Lewis wrote. \u201cThe assumption that the job was Julian\u2019s if he simply wanted it just rubbed me the wrong way.\u201d\n\nLewis\u2019s father was a sharecropper, while Bond was the son of a university professor, a class difference that played out in that \u201986 race where Lewis fought harder, and Bond was taken aback. He was a man more of contemplation than action. He wrote essays and poetry and he always had this bemused expression, like he was translating politics into iambic pentameter.\n\nHe frustrated his admirers because he didn\u2019t seem to aim high, but realistically his path to higher office was eclipsed in that \u201986 race. And in \u201987, he was quoted saying, \u201cI can\u2019t live up to other people\u2019s ambitions for me\u2026I\u2019m really flattered when somebody tells me \u2018You should be this or you should be that.\u2019 But\u2026I have to do what I have to do.\u201d\n\nWhat he did was remain relevant apart from holding public office, maintaining his stature as a civil-rights icon and chairing the NAACP for 12 years. And he stretched his influence into an area not always comfortable for African-American leaders, becoming a dedicated advocate of gay and lesbian rights. His widow, Pamela Horowitz, told The Washington Post that the intensive care nurse told her what a privilege it was to care for him.\n\n\u201cShe said, \u2018As a gay American, I thought he was a hero.\u2019 And for her to say that, for her to be the last person who was with him, I thought it was a nice way to end.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:30.460+0000"}

How long can he stay in the race?\n\nLast Monday, former Congressman and three-time presidential candidate Ron Paul wrote to express his support for the Iran nuclear deal. The negotiation, he said, was \u201cone of the two most important achievements of an otherwise pretty dismal Obama presidency\u201d and, further, it proved \u201cthat sometimes taking a principled position means facing down overwhelming opposition from all sides and not backing down.\u201d\n\nAwkwardly, that opposition includes Rand Paul, his son, who not coincidentally is finding himself struggling in the polls and in the money race as he campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAccording to an NBC News/Marist poll released Sunday, Paul commands just 4 percent support in New Hampshire\u2013a loss of 10 percentage points since February.\n\nPaul\u2019s second-quarter financial haul was $7 million, which places him behind every Republican who has disclosed their earnings except for Carly Fiorina, who you may not have even heard of, Rick Perry, who is under indictment in Texas and barely qualifies for the first debate, Rick Santorum, who doesn\u2019t qualify, Bobby Jindal, who had just six days to fundraise, and Mike Huckabee, whose campaign platform seems to be uncomfortable Holocaust references.\n\nPaul\u2019s super PAC, America's Liberty PAC, raised just $3.1 million. In comparison, Jeb Bush\u2019s super PAC raised $103 million.\n\nNoting Paul\u2019s collapse, FiveThirtyEight asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s Wrong With Rand Paul\u2019s Campaign?\u201d The answer, writer Harry Enten concluded, was that Paul had faded from the headlines and, simultaneously, his favorability among Republicans had declined.\n\nBut that\u2019s more of a symptom than the cause of the cancer on Paul\u2019s candidacy. The root of the decay is this: As Rand Paul has campaigned, it has become increasingly evident that he is not the candidate his supporters were promised he would be\u2013a more electable version of his father. And the candidate he did turn out to be is not interesting or authentic enough to stand out from the 20,000 other Republicans seeking the nomination. Paul, previously \u201cthe most interesting man in politics,\u201d is now just scenery.\n\nRon Paul raised enormous sums of money in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns (though, at this same juncture in the primary in 2011, the elder Paul had raised just $4.5 million in the second quarter), capitalizing on the post-Bush administration war-fatigue and big-government skepticism that made his anti-interventionist, libertarian ideals seem sunny in comparison. But Ron Paul could not overcome his outsider reputation. He was seen, despite his grassroots momentum (complete with legendary \u201cIT\u2019S HAPPENING\u201d gif), as an elfin, fringe character\u2013too much of an oddball to demand serious consideration.\n\nFor Rand to succeed, the conventional wisdom went, he would need to hold onto his father\u2019s base of supporters while appealing to other constituencies\u2014most importantly, mainstream Republican primary voters.\n\nThe root of the decay is this: as Rand Paul has campaigned, it has become increasingly evident that he is not the candidate his supporters were promised he would be\u2013a more electable version of his father.\n\nBut in his attempt to seem more appealing to those other constituencies, Paul has compromised himself into obscurity. He takes, with the exception of national security issues, positions that are no different from those of any other GOP candidate\u2014and though his reasons for arriving at those positions are nuanced and complex, that doesn't make the end result any different. Paul is an anti-gay marriage, life-begins-at-conception, boots-on-the-ground (in limited quantities!) -to-combat-ISIS, prayer-breakfast-pandering right-winger. But one whose wheels are always turning!\n\nHis supporters are catching on, and they\u2019re not happy about it.\n\n\u201cPeople just don\u2019t like that kind of dishonesty,\u201d Justin Raimondo, founder of Antiwar.com and former Rand-zealot, told me.\n\nRaimondo used to believe, as many Paul supporters do (or did), that at the end of the day, he would Stand with Rand\u2122 because Rand was the only politician with a shot at the White House whose beliefs came close to mirroring his own. But one disappointment after another wore Raimondo down. When Paul signed Senator Tom Cotton\u2019s Iran letter, which was designed to halt the very negotiations Paul claimed to favor, it was the last straw.\n\n\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s basically just selling out,\u201d Raimondo said.\n\n\u201cHow is he different from any of the other candidates?\u201d he asked. \u201cHis father stood out. I mean, he really stood out. Rand is sort of going in the opposite direction\u2014he\u2019s trying to blend in. But that\u2019s not a smart strategy.\u201d\n\nNowhere is the limits of Paul\u2019s strategy more evident than his opposition to the Iran deal his father so enthusiastically supports. Paul\u2019s evolution on Iran is his clearest flip-flop, though it was gradual. In 2007, when he was proudly wearing the title \u201cRon Paul clone\u201d given to him by conspiracy theorist, radio host, and iodine droplet salesman Alex Jones, Paul was claiming that if Iran were to obtain a nuclear weapon, it wouldn\u2019t even be a big deal. Today, he says that the fact that the Iran deal leaves the country with nuclear capacity is grounds to dismiss it altogether.\n\nOn top of his weakened reputation and wheezing presidential campaign, spokespeople for which ignored requests for comment for this article, Paul has the added burden of an upcoming Senate campaign to contend with. His $7 million second-quarter haul is, according to CNN, \u201csplit between the presidential bank account and a joint fundraising committee.\"\n\nKentucky law stipulates that Paul can\u2019t run for both offices at once, and a measure passed in the state Senate to permit him to won\u2019t be voted on until February, when the legislature is back in session\u2014too late to make a difference for the campaign, for which Paul will need to formally file in January. So the state party is reckoning with the logistics of ensuring Paul can run for both seats.\n\nBut that won\u2019t ensure a positive outcome for his state or his party.\n\nA source in Kentucky politics conceded that while \u201cconventional wisdom would say\u201d that Paul needs to pick one race or the other so as to not jeopardize his seat, \u201cSenator Paul has shown time and time again that he does not always follow conventional wisdom.\u201d\n\nThe nightmare \u201cworst-case scenario,\u201d the source said, \u201cis that he loses both.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s just a nightmare, of course. The reality is, in this primary, nothing matters and anything could happen. Paul\u2019s failure to sustain his moment is owed not just to his \u201cselling out,\u201d as Raimondo calls it, but to the fact that he made the mistake of testing the waters too early and too publicly. Paul began campaigning in the spring of 2014\u2014a full year before he would formally announce. He filled a void by being the only likely candidate consistently touring the country and acting like, well, a candidate for the summer and some of the fall. During that time, he was rewarded with countless headlines, in-depth profiles and, the aforementioned label \u201cmost interesting man in politics\u201d (not that that\u2019s hard). It was inevitable, in retrospect, that Paul-fatigue would set in and other candidates would fill his space. It\u2019s not inevitable now, but entirely possible that he will rise again.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Rand Paul's fundraising numbers placed him above only Carly Fiorina and Rick Perry. That has been corrected to reflect that he also outpaces Huckabee, Jindal and Santorum.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:31.346+0000"}

I\u2019m like a Greek god that just took a bath in a pumpkin-spiced latte.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s be honest, Fallon\u2019s a lightweight,\u201d Trump\u2019s doppelganger mused. \u201cThe only one qualified to interview me is me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMe interviewing me\u2014that\u2019s what I call a great idea,\u201d the real Trump agreed.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s a great idea! We thought of it!\u201d the doppelganger exclaimed.\n\nMaybe all that sounds a bit mind-bendingly meta, but the studio audience (i.e. Trump\u2019s target voters) clearly loved it, cackling, cheering and shouting throughout with unrestrained glee; it might as well have been a Trump for President rally.\n\n\u201cHow are you gonna create jobs in this country?\u201d the doppelganger asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just gonna do it,\u201d Trump replied.\n\n\u201cBut how?\u201d\n\n\u201cBy doing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cGenius!\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger persisted: \u201cYou said you\u2019d get Mexico to build a wall on the border. How do you plan to do that?\u201d\n\nTrump parried: \u201cWell, since I\u2019m you, you tell me.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow am I going to get Mexico to build a wall? Easy,\u201d said the doppelganger. \u201cI\u2019ll challenge them to the biggest game of Jenga ever. I\u2019ll make them set up the board. And then when they finish I\u2019ll say I don\u2019t wanna play anymore.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou wanna know something? That\u2019s genius!\u201d Trump replied.\n\nAnd so it went, as the real Trump ticked off a long-winded list of problems and fixes (while Fallon, breaking character and struggling not to lose it, copied the candidate\u2019s extravagant hand-gestures).\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t paying attention,\u201d the Fallon-esque Trump admitted when the real Trump had finished. \u201cI was too busy staring at my beautiful reflection. I\u2019m like a Greek god that just took a bath in a pumpkin-spiced latte.\u201d\n\nThe doppelganger asked a final question: \u201cIf you win is your vice president gonna be Gary Busey?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, I love Gary, he\u2019s fantastic, but more of a Supreme Court justice in my opinion,\u201d the real Trump said, referring to one of the more notable\u2014that is, peculiar\u2014contestants on the now-defunct NBC reality series, Celebrity Apprentice. \u201cVice president\u2019s a very serious job so I\u2019m probably gonna go with somebody else\u2014I would say maybe Kanye West\u2026\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be really classy. It\u2019s gonna be really fantastic. It\u2019s gonna be\u201d\u2014and here the doppelganger joined in\u2014\u201cYUUUUUUUGE!!!\u201d\n\nIt would be nice to report that Trump\u2019s actual Tonight Show interview, his first appearance on late-night entertainment television since declaring his presidential candidacy three months ago (and all the more congenial because of Trump\u2019s last-minute decision to drop his Miss Universe and Miss USA lawsuits against NBC), was in stark contrast to his sendup of himself.\n\nIt really wasn\u2019t.\n\nTrump is just as boastful, self-inflated and hype-obsessed in real life as in the satirical version.\n\nIt will be fascinating to see how or whether Stephen Colbert\u2014whose comic sensibility is more cerebral than Fallon\u2019s\u2014tries to puncture the balloon when the candidate visits with the freshly minted CBS late-night host on Sept. 22.\n\nHillary Clinton, meanwhile, will drop by Fallon\u2019s show next Wednesday, the same night as the Republican debate on CNN.\n\nNow, more than ever, the road to the White House passes unavoidably through comedy and entertainment, and aspiring presidents who can\u2019t or won\u2019t participate will do themselves no favors.\n\nTrump, however, is more than happy to play along.\n\nAfter bursting from behind the Tonight Show curtain, giving two thumbs up to the ecstatic crowd and strolling majestically to a handshake from Fallon and then the sofa, Trump frequently flashed a Cheshire-cat grin as he good-naturedly\u2014and viciously\u2014slagged off various opponents, Hillary Clinton and Carly Fiorina in particular.\n\nDiscussing the former first lady and secretary of state whose Democratic-frontrunner status is sagging under the weight of the email controversy, Trump opined that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of bad stuff\u201d in the latest scandal and that former CIA director and retired Gen. David Petraeus, who pled guilty to a misdemeanor and paid a $40,000 fine for his own mishandling classified material, \u201cdid five percent of what she did.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s gonna be very tough for her\u2014a very, very bad time,\u201d Trump said about Clinton. \u201cI feel terribly about it,\u201d he added, prompting Fallon to laugh along with the audience.\n\nAs for Republican rival Carly Fiorina, whose face Trump made fun of to a Rolling Stone reporter, The Donald dripped insincerity as he told Fallon: \u201cI think she\u2019s a very nice woman. A really nice woman\u2026Am I doing a good job?\u201d\n\nThen, as the laughter subsided, he went in for the kill: \u201cI don\u2019t know her. I never really met her. She\u2019s very nice. She\u2019s gonna have a hard time. She had a very, very rough time corporately\u201d\u2014a reference to Fiorina\u2019s firing as chief executive of Hewlett-Packard.\n\nTrump added, in a patronizing tone: \u201cI think she\u2019s a very fine woman.\u201d As for the other candidates, Trump said, \u201cto me, they\u2019re all the same.\u201d\n\nThe only big difference from the sketch, which preceded the interview, was that every so often Fallon injected a dose of skepticism and sheer amazement.\n\nWhen Fallon asked what Trump believed had brought his candidacy to its current advantageous position, Trump launched into a crazy-quilt of free-association that somehow concluded in crowd counts in various arenas and stadiums where his rallies had been held.\n\n\u201cWhat question did I ask?\u201d Fallon mused. \u201cDid I ask about stadiums? What the hell just happened? I couldn\u2019t even remember what the question was.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that important,\u201d Trump retorted.\n\n\u201cMaybe what\u2019s refreshing,\u201d Fallon observed, \u201cis that you get yourself in trouble sometimes. You dig yourself a hole, and instead of getting out of the hole, you just dig deeper. If you keep digging, you eventually might come out in China and be president of China.\u201d\n\nThe most revealing moment in their back and forth was when Fallon asked Trump if he had ever in his entire life apologized for anything.\n\n\u201cI fully think apologizing is a great thing,\u201d Trump answered. \u201cBut you have to be wrong. If you\u2019re not wrong\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cOh my God!\u201d Fallon exclaimed, looking like he was ready to fall out of his chair as the audience, once again, roared.\n\n\u201cI will apologize sometime in the hopefully distance future if I\u2019m ever wrong,\u201d Trump elaborated.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:31.655+0000"}
{"entityId": 1950, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "High crime is good for Republican political prospects\u2014and, with murder rates increasing nationwide, that should have Democrats worried about 2016.\n\nFrom New York to Chicago, Baltimore to New Orleans, and Milwaukee to Dallas, the hydra-headed scourges of crime, murder, and mayhem have returned. And as the country hurtles toward 2016, this grim reality could prove to be a political nightmare for the Democrats. But, for the Republicans, crime represents a well-trodden pathway to power.\n\nLet me explain. As in 1968, crime again stands to dislodge the Democrats from the White House, in the same way that in 1988 crime helped propel George H.W. Bush to Ronald Reagan\u2019s third term.\n\nLook around\u2014history can repeat itself. This past week, three men gunned down police Lieutenant Joe Gliniewicz in President Obama\u2019s adopted home state of Illinois, even as people were mourning the execution-style killing of Darren Goforth, a Harris County, Texas, sheriff\u2019s deputy.\n\nYet Obama and his party appear helpless, hostages to the same demographic forces they courted, and then rode to power. Having staked their future on the volatile axis of race and income, the Democrats are now witnessing crime reemerge as a campaign issue, and they are out of touch and ill-prepared, to say the least.\n\nWhile America\u2019s law-abiding taxpaying middle class was looking at all this in horror, the best that Obama could muster was a statement that \u201cTargeting police officers is completely unacceptable\u2014an affront to civilized society,\u201d and a phone call to Deputy Goforth\u2019s widow. The president\u2019s response felt nonchalant, lacking the urgency of now that the Justice Department poured into Ferguson.\n\nMeanwhile, the Democratic National Committee was spending its time and political capital on a resolution embracing the Black Lives Matter movement. Even in the midst of the blood and the din, it was all about the base.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, murder is up 76 percent in Milwaukee, 60 percent in St. Louis, 56 percent in Baltimore, and 44 percent in D.C. Blue America is awash in red.\n\nIn what must have been a shock to the DNC, Black Lives Matter replied with a \u201cno, thank you.\u201d Instead, it let it be known that \u201cTrue change requires real struggle, and that struggle will be in the streets and led by the people, not by a political party.\u201d\n\nTranslation: The summer of 2016 season may be more memorable for what happens on the streets of Cleveland and Philadelphia than inside the convention halls. The ghosts of Chicago and the 1968 Democratic Convention are once again alive, and ready to haunt.\n\nFor the Republicans, crime is quickly becoming a campaign issue. Just days ago, Senator Ted Cruz took direct aim at the White House for the latest killing spree. According to Cruz, cops are feeling the assault \u201cfrom the president, from the top on down as we see \u2026 Whether it\u2019s in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response of senior officials of the president, of the attorney general, is to vilify law enforcement.\u201d\n\nCruz is not alone in homing in on crime. Donald Trump and Jeb Bush are also sparring over who is tougher. Trump released a video which spliced together the former Florida governor\u2019s description of some illegal immigration as an \u201cact of love\u201d with the mugshots of three illegal aliens who have been charged with or been convicted of murder.\n\nBush then punched back by reminding the public of Trump\u2019s past support for Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer, and drug legalization. As the Bush campaign put it, \u201cWhile Donald Trump was still supporting liberal, soft-on-crime politicians, Jeb Bush accumulated an eight-year record of cracking down on violent criminals as governor of Florida.\u201d\n\nSuddenly, the Democrats are playing defense as our cities have turned into shooting galleries. Against a blizzard of crime videos, Hillary Clinton\u2019s exhortation in April that \u201cwe should make sure every police department in the country has body cameras to record interactions between officers on patrol and suspects,\u201d is looking both na\u00efve and opportunistic.\n\nOh, and in case anyone forgot, it was Bill Clinton, who as president, toughened the federal anti-crime laws that have now led to \u201cmass incarceration.\u201d It was also Bill Clinton who left the 1992 campaign trail to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector for the murder of Robert Martin, a Conway, Arkansas, police officer. Heck, it was Clinton who took Sister Souljah to task for advocating that blacks kill whites.\n\nTo be sure, crime has real sway as a campaign rallying cry. As John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, told The Daily Beast, \u201cWhen crime goes up, it\u2019s not the economic and social elites who notice first. They live in nice suburbs, gated communities, or well-guarded apartment buildings.\u201d\n\nRather, according to Pitney, it\u2019s the folks scraping by who first feel crime\u2019s sting. \u201cThe people on the front line are the people who aren\u2019t so well off. They live in the neighborhoods where you have to watch your step. And they\u2019re the ones least able to bear the consequences of a burglary or robbery.\u201d\n\nPitney is dead on. As The New York Times reported, murder is up 76 percent in Milwaukee, 60 percent in St. Louis, 56 percent in Baltimore, and 44 percent in D.C. Blue America is awash in red.\n\nFor today\u2019s Democrats\u2019s upstairs-downstairs coalition these are hard lessons to absorb. Polls are already showing that Clinton is getting little more than one-third of the white vote, and is in a statistical dead heat with the leading Republicans. When prospective Democratic nominee Martin O\u2019Malley gets booed for saying that all lives matter, our nation has a problem.\n\nOver the past half-century, crime has helped elect two Republicans as president. In 2016, crime may elect a third.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:31.918+0000"}

{"entityId": 1952, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As they fight over a new trade deal, Democrat should recall their top task for 2016: educating voters on the reality of wage stagnation\u2014by going back to 1979, when the flatline started.\n\nFor the moment, the Democrats have resumed their time-honored posture of arguing about trade policy. It\u2019s an important issue, and one on which I\u2019m not sure where I come down. But as they prepare to rip each other\u2019s flesh, they might bear in mind it isn\u2019t the issue. The issue, as I wrote two weeks ago in urging Hillary Clinton to go big, is wage stagnation. I offer this up as a timely public-service reminder: Remember, folks, what you agree on.\n\nAs I noted in the go big column, wages have been in essence flat for earners\u2014up 6 percent (adjusted for inflation)\u2014in the middle of the income scale since 1979. For the top 1 percent, compensation has risen about 140 percent since the fateful year. This needs to be the issue of this campaign. If American voters don\u2019t know these 6 percent and 140 percent figures November 8 next year, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats will have done something very wrong.\n\nEconomists choose 1979 as the cutoff year because, looking back over the numbers, that\u2019s when the flattening started. It\u2019s also about when compensation at the top started soaring (a little later, actually). Until the early to mid-1980s, Wall Streeters and corporate lawyers and actors and university presidents and star athletes made more than the rest of us, but they didn\u2019t make gobs more.\n\nFor example, the average baseball salary doubled, up to around $370,000, from 1981 to 1985. The average wage in that same time frame went from $13,773 in 1981 to $16,822 in 1985, an 18 percent increase. Not bad, better than average; but not double by a long shot. I\u2019m not saying the juxtaposition of these numbers proves anything more than it proves. But it is certainly representative of what was happening to American wages then and has been happening since.\n\nAnother way of looking at it: The average ballplayer went from making about 12 times the average American to 22 times. Today, incidentally, it\u2019s 108 times, $4.25 million to around $39,000.\n\nSo what we\u2019re gonna do right here is go back, way back, as an old song had it, to the year of Apocalypse Now and Get the Knack and those hideous Pittsburgh Pirates uniforms that so offended my aesthetic sensibilities that I had no choice but to cheer against the team I\u2019d grown up worshipping. Let\u2019s ask: What if the wage structure in the United States today were the same as it was in 1979?\n\nLarry Summers asked the question in the Financial Times back in January. The bottom 80 percent of earners, he wrote, would have $11,000 more per family, and the top 1 percent would have $750,000 less. In the wake of Summers\u2019s column, the folks at NPR\u2019s Planet Money took it one step further and calculated the increased (or decreased) income for households at several points along the wage structure. It\u2019ll pop your little eyes.\n\nThe poorest wage-earners, at $12,000, would be making $3,282 more. That\u2019s a 27 percent increase. Those at $30,000 would be making $6,928 more (23 percent). Those at $52,000 would be getting $8,752 more (16.8 percent). For those at $84,000, the increase drops off, to $5,834 more (7 percent). But it kicks back up for those at $122,000, to $17,311 (14.2 percent). And finally, those in the top 1 percent, at $1.41 million, would see a decrease in earnings of $824,844, or a whopping 58 percent.\n\nThe minimum wage was $2.90 in 1979. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $9.38 today instead of the actual $7.25, which is a 23 percent decline.\n\nNow before we go any further\u2014no, no one today is talking about anything as confiscatory as wiping out 58 percent of the top 1 percent\u2019s earnings. That isn\u2019t how it\u2019s going to work anymore, with top marginal tax rates of 76 percent (which does not mean that the government took three-quarters of someone\u2019s money; go look up the concept of \u201cmarginal\u201d if you don\u2019t get this).\n\nBut the wage structure is a function of a whole host of other policies and practices that have nothing to do with marginal tax rates. It has to do, yes, with the minimum wage. It was $2.90 in 1979. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $9.38 today instead of the actual $7.25, which is a 23 percent decline for those workers, and minimum wage is generally thought to have knock-on effects at least a third of the way up the wage chain. It has a lot to do with corporate culture: In 1979, CEOs at the top few hundred corporations made about 28 times the average worker\u2019s salary; now they make more than 200 times. There were 15.1 million private-sector union workers in the United States in 1979; last year, there were 7.35 million. And in 1979, Washington oversaw a lot more in public investment than it does today, and those dollars by and large went into real things, from bridges to scientific research, instead of swaps and derivatives.\n\nNow, 1979 was a bad year in some important ways\u2014inflation, hostage crisis\u2014so I\u2019m not saying I think it would be the world\u2019s greatest idea for the Democrats to campaign on bringing back 1979. It\u2019s not about the year per se. That just happens to be the year the thing started happening. And the thing is flat wages for most people who work for a living.\n\nThe trade fight has to be played out, and it seems that the unions and the Warren wing are probably going to lose, because the president will get enough votes from Republicans and moderate Democrats. And of course it\u2019ll be interesting to see how Clinton plays it. Whichever position she takes, we can be sure she\u2019ll do it cautiously.\n\nSo dust will be kicked up over that. It has to be. The differences are real. But comparatively, the differences are small. Democrats must keep their eyes on the prize. \u201cWho cares more about increasing the wages of working Americans?\u201d is a debate question the Republicans can never win. The Democrats have to make sure the election is about that question.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:32.671+0000"}

The caps-lock key is the Palin family\u2019s rhetorical open-carry, deployed in the mistaken belief that it makes the bearer seem more formidable, when really it underscores the weakness of the case.\n\nSarah\u2019s tirade in particular radiates schoolyard smugness, the smirk of a lunchroom bully who thinks she\u2019s scored a sick burn on the class nerd\u2014she doesn\u2019t just think she\u2019s made a devastating point, she\u2019s already figuratively turning around to accept high-fives from her pals.\n\nAre you not familiar with Dunham\u2019s perversions? She once looked at her sister\u2019s vagina. She was 7. As sexually frustrated teenager, she masturbated while her sister slept in the same bed. I\u2019m sure there are people who have never masturbated in a less-than-private place, but my casual sampling suggests this is within the bounds of normal. All of it is.\n\nBut, for the Palins, there\u2019s a smoking gun. Dunham says she once bribed her younger sister to kiss her on the mouth. She was desperate for affirmation; she worried about her place in the family. In her book, she jokes that her insecurity and desire for attention drove her to try \u201canything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl.\u201d It\u2019s a joke because her motives weren\u2019t the same as a sexual predator\u2019s\u2014even if her behavior, superficially, was.\n\nWhereas Josh Duggar was a sexual predator.\n\nEquating Dunham\u2019s and Duggar\u2019s behavior is not the only category error the Palins made. Also in terms of comparing Dunham\u2019s and Duggar\u2019s places in the media galaxy, what sorts of celebrities they are, the Palins are comparing apples and some kind of fruit nobody\u2019s ever heard of.\n\nLena Dunham is an author, filmmaker, actress, and, yes, political activist. While there\u2019s no doubt that she\u2019s benefitted from family connections and social capital not available to your average twenty-something, she\u2019s famous because she\u2019s good at what she does. She made Tiny Furniture and Girls before she campaigned for Obama, not the other way around. Josh Duggar\u2019s family may not be rich, but he is famous solely because he belongs to the Duggar family. And the Duggars are essentially famous for the same reason the Kardashians are: their sex lives.\n\nSara Palin, the Duggars and a host of other conservative folk heros decry the mainstream media while ceaselessly courting it. It\u2019s a good schtick, until it goes badly wrong.\n\nConservatives take their celebrities where they can get them. Sure, there are actors and country music stars, snatched up quickly for pro-troop specials and benefits, but the Duggars are the rare example of a true conservative folk hero crossovers, individuals whose fame is not dependent on a celebrity-generating skill (acting, singing) but on a set of beliefs. They share that slim slice of Venn diagram (general popular recognition and genuine conservative activism) with the Duck Dynasty clan and a smattering of lesser lights: Joe the Plumber, the owners of Memories Pizza, Cliven Bundy, and Pam Geller. Military heroes are adopted quickly, and territorially. Ben Carson was raised up immediately after his one-sided \u201cconfrontation\u201d with the president.\n\nIndeed, there was that brief moment when it seemed like conservative America might adopt Caitlyn Jenner as an icon. If only liberals were as upset with Jenner\u2019s stated party ID as Rush Limbaugh and the Twitteratti thought it might be. It has turned out that Jenner\u2019s party affiliation is the least interesting thing about her. Really, that a wealthy white woman is Republican isn\u2019t nearly as surprising as how many rural, middle-class people are.\n\nConservatives might argue\u2014and they have a point\u2014that liberals don\u2019t need a separate celebrity culture. Liberal media darlings are, pretty much, media darlings. Their path to celebrity isn\u2019t political because it doesn\u2019t need to be political. Lena Dunham isn\u2019t famous because she\u2019s the victim of a right-wing pile-on, she\u2019s the victim of right-wing pile-on because she\u2019s famous.\n\nThe Left doesn\u2019t have anything quite like the conservative folk hero, people who are neither politicians nor activists nor professional performers but simply famous for being liberals. Sandra Fluke, perhaps. Cindy Sheehan (remember her?) And when they do pop up, the liberal political ecosystem doesn\u2019t have the same network of conferences, straw polls and candidate cattle-calls that prop up the Duggars and their brethren.\n\nEven more than the conferences, however, conservative folk heroes find their credibility increases not via leadership but through victimhood. All criticism by mainstream voices becomes proof of worthiness\u2014and the case of Josh Duggar exposes just how self-defeating the raising up these folk heroes via victimhood can be.\n\nNot that the Palins would realize this. What does Sarah Palin\u2019s own fame stand on now these days, anyway? A caps-lock key and a sense of grievance. It\u2019s not much, but these days, it\u2019s all any conservative celebrity needs. Ironically, it\u2019s their grievance that makes them worthy of attention from the mainstream media as well. The Duggars\u2019 and Palins\u2019 off-the-map political and world views are what draw attention. Outsiders want to stare at the spectacle.\n\nMaybe the cruelest trick that liberal elites ever pulled was luring so many camera-starved conservatives into the limelight\u2014and out of the reality distortion field of their own devising.\n\nUPDATE: An earlier version of this story did not mention the vagina peeping or masturbation and instead focused on Dunham\u2019s \u201cadmission\u201d of being a sexual predator. I apologize for failing to distinguish between the non-incidents of non-abuse in the Dunham household.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:32.949+0000"}

{"entityId": 1955, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "After Ferguson (and Staten Island and North Charleston), black women want to hear some answers from Hillary that white women don\u2019t.\n\nOn the day Hillary Clinton launched her second presidential campaign, coverage of her dominated most major media outlets. But on just about every news program Clinton\u2019s campaign ended up sharing the spotlight with another story: the aftermath of the death of Walter Scott, an unarmed black man who was filmed being shot in the back multiple times by a police officer.\n\nThe shooting of Scott appears to have marked a turning point in the debate over the relationship between law enforcement and communities of color. The tragedy is already sparking self-reflection and serious discussion of policy changes by those within the law enforcement community. Former New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly announced his support for body cameras on all police officers because of the shocking Scott footage, which he called a \u201cgame changer.\u201d\n\n\n\nAmericans of all races have expressed outrage and grief at Scott\u2019s death. But the anguished reaction of his mother, Judy, served as a stark reminder that while there are universal struggles, hopes, and dreams that women of all races share, there remain some experiences that resonate more greatly in communities of color. Being a woman who lives in fear that your father, brother, husband, or son may be harmed at any moment by those sworn to serve and protect us all is one of them. Which presents a potential challenge for Hillary Clinton as she seeks to woo the voters that President Obama most owes his election to: black women.\n\nIn recent elections it has been possible for a candidate to argue that the issues that are most important to women are those that largely transcend racial lines, such as the economy, pay equity, affordable child care, access to birth control, etc. But as discussions of race, law enforcement, and police brutality have begun to dominate political discourse within the last year it is no longer realistic to assume that when women of different races walk into a voting booth, they are pulling the lever for the same reasons.\n\nI recently spoke with a family member who said she has never cast a presidential vote based on issues like criminal justice or police brutality before, but this is the first presidential election in which candidates\u2019 positions on these subjects and racial profiling will affect her vote. She stressed that she\u2019s not seeking platitudes, but wants to hear what substantive policy solutions candidates are proposing to address these issues, and she added that based on her conversations with other black women she knows she is not alone.\n\nNow one person and her circle of friends does not a focus group make, but I know that for me personally I have thought about these issues myself more in the last year than I ever have. I know that I\u2019m not alone, and I also know that I couldn\u2019t imagine voting for any candidate, of any party, who doesn\u2019t seem to have a clear understanding of these issues and a vision for addressing them.\n\nIf even a small number of black women don\u2019t turn out in 2016, that\u2019s enough to cost her the election.\n\nThe 2012 election marked the first election recorded in which black voter turnout surpassed that of whites. But according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data, \u201cMuch of the surge in black participation was driven by an unusually high turnout among black women. Nationally, the voting rate among all women was about 4 percentage points higher than among all men. But among African-American voters, that gap was nearly 9 percentage points.\u201d More white women, it should be noted, supported the president\u2019s opponent, Mitt Romney, as well as his Republican predecessor, John McCain.\n\nThis means that black women were crucial to President Obama\u2019s win in 2012, particularly in swing states like Ohio. It is no secret that black women not only admire the president, but many older black women feel maternal affection for him, as though he\u2019s the son they wish they had or hope their own sons will grow up to be. And when he shared his own stories of being racially profiled in the wake of the Trayvon Martin tragedy, many black Americans related, and many black mothers empathized.\n\nThrough no fault of her own it is impossible for Hillary Clinton to connect with black women in the same way, yet that doesn\u2019t mean she shouldn\u2019t or won\u2019t try. If she doesn\u2019t she will not become president. This means that her campaign can\u2019t simply talk about issues that matter to women, but needs to talk about issues that matter specifically to black women. Not because a sizable number of black women voters are likely to vote for the Republican candidate. But because if even a small number of black women don\u2019t turn out in 2016, that\u2019s enough to cost her the election.\n\nSpeaking on background a Clinton campaign spokesperson said, \u201cHillary Clinton has spent her career working to advance opportunities for African-American women, will work to earn their votes and make sure they and their families don\u2019t just get by, but that they get ahead and stay ahead. She has put African-American women atop her campaign leadership team overseeing political and state operations.\u201d These hires include Tracey Lewis, who will serve as the campaign\u2019s primary states director, and Brynne Craig, who will be the deputy national political director.\n\nIn an email citing the issues that the campaign plans to focus on that they believe will most resonate with black women, the spokesperson wrote, \u201cIncrease of take-home pay, the importance of expanding early childhood education and making higher education more affordable.\u201d There was no mention of making the justice system more equitable. Clinton, did however, tweet her sympathies to the family of Walter Scott.\n\nBut if she wants to win over black women voters, and have any chance of winning the White House, she will need to do more than tweet.\n\n", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:34.778+0000"}

The two candidates have met in person at least five times and talk by phone occasionally. And in the future, they may even hold events together.\n\nThe two campaigns privately discussed a possible joint event this year in Washington, D.C., and Cruz was invited to join Trump\u2019s infamous trip to the Mexico border, though a scheduling problem prevented him from attending, sources told The Daily Beast.\n\n\u201cIn terms of Trump\u2019s civility, if you\u2019re nice to him, he\u2019ll be nice to you. And Cruz has been nice. Cruz is playing the long game and hopes that if he survives and Trump doesn\u2019t, the billionaire will swing to him. He\u2019s the second choice for a lot of Trump voters,\u201d said a source familiar with the inner workings of the Trump campaign.\n\n\u201cCruz has been cultivating Donald for some time, declining to criticize him after the immigration flap or the McCain controversy, sending messages through operatives, dropping by Trump Tower when in New York,\u201d the source continued.\n\n\u201cCruz is being very sly,\u201d the Trump campaign insider said. \u201c[He] attracts the same types of voter. A lot of second-choice voters for Trump are Cruz people\u2026 Cruz wants those votes.\u201d\n\nThe two draw from similar segments of the Republican primary electorate\u2014sometimes, almost too similar. In the video launching his presidential bid, Cruz made a passing reference to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d which has since become the Trump campaign\u2019s slogan. Trump applied for a trademark on the phrase shortly after the 2012 election.\n\nThe Texas senator\u2019s use of the phrase, even in passing, prompted the Trump Organization to reach out and warn the Cruz camp in a friendly manner not to use it again, according to a Trump campaign insider.\n\nThe relationship has proved to be mutually beneficial for the two presidential candidates, but Cruz stands to benefit the most.\n\nIf Trump\u2019s campaign were to flame out, it stands to reason that Cruz would be near the top of the list for potential endorsements. And even without an endorsement, Cruz would likely be a strong contender for Trump supporters looking for a new candidate to support. Cruz\u2019s PAC also received money from Trump: a $5,000 donation in 2014.\n\n\u201cCruz is being very sly,\u201d the Trump campaign insider said. \u201c[He] attracts the same types of voter. A lot of second-choice voters for Trump are Cruz people\u2026 Cruz wants those votes.\u201d\n\nIn Cruz, Trump has a prominent politician who is willing to defend his comments. He may even have, in his mind, a potential running mate.\n\nAfter Trump said during his campaign launch that Mexican \u201crapists\u201d and \u201ckillers\u201d were migrating to the United States, Cruz stepped up to defend the comments.\n\n\u201cI like Donald Trump. I think he\u2019s terrific, I think he\u2019s brash, I think he speaks the truth,\u201d Cruz said on Fox News.\n\n\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. The Cruz campaign declined to comment. But an aide to Cruz, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the two had bonded over the issue of illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cThe senator has repeatedly credited Trump for bringing so much attention to the illegal immigration issue,\u201d the aide said. \u201cThe senator has been, in my mind, extremely clear about not wanting to belittle Trump and his supporters, because [those supporters] feel very passionately about a serious issue. That has certainly set the senator apart from the other candidates who have been critical of Trump, and by association critical of Trump\u2019s supporters as well.\u201d\n\n\n\nAs early as 2013, Trump believed that Cruz would run for president, a Trump campaign insider said.\n\nThe two met briefly at the Iowa Family Leadership summit in August 2013. \u201cI thought he was a terrific guy,\u201d Trump said on Fox News shortly after. \u201cI met his father. Also terrific. And we had a great conversation.\u201d\n\nFollowing their first run-in, discussions began about a more formal meeting. It eventually happened in November 2013, when Cruz visited Trump Tower while on a fundraising swing through New York City.\n\nDuring the meeting, the two discussed Cruz\u2019s birthplace, Cruz told The Dallas Morning News. But Cruz\u2019s erstwhile Canadian citizenship was not to be a problem\u2014at least not an insurmountable one. Two months later, in January 2014, Trump donated $5,000 to Cruz\u2019s PAC, the Jobs Growth and Freedom Fund.\n\nTrump and Cruz met again at Trump Tower in mid-July of this year.\n\nJust days later, Trump questioned whether Senator John McCain was a hero because he was captured as a POW, and Cruz declined to condemn the statement, calling Trump \u201ca friend\u201d on CNN.\n\n\n\nTrump and Cruz have appeared at other events together, such as an American Spectator dinner and a Republican event at Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. And during the government shutdown in 2013, the two spoke by phone, Politico reported.\n\n\n\nBut their chummy relationship hasn\u2019t bought Cruz immunity from Trump\u2019s birther instincts. As recently as March, Trump cast doubt on whether Cruz could run for present, since Cruz was born in Canada.\n\nIn certain circles on the right, this is no small issue. On the day of Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign launch, Rush Limbaugh gave a long monologue on his conservative talk radio show insisting the senator is eligible for the White House.\n\nTrump and Cruz have not made any secret of their mutual admiration. Cruz has had no problem developing combative relationships with other Republicans in the presidential field or in Congress, but with Trump it has been nothing but kindness. If anything, their public praise understates the curiously cozy relationship that the two have in private.\n\n\u2014 Alexa Corse contributed to this report", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:35.515+0000"}

Nevertheless, the President and his equally deluded aides invested so much in this moderate breakthrough, he was willing to risk offending Congress, trying to bypass its constitutionally\u2014sanctioned foreign policy input.\n\nNo, this is not some neocon attack on President Barack Obama\u2019s recent sanctions-lifting nuclear agreement with Iran. This description of the Iran-Contra affair harks backs to July 1985 when the Republican Ronald Reagan tried freeing American hostages and boosting Iran\u2019s supposed moderates by resupplying Iran with American weapons and spare parts. Wherever you stand on today\u2019s Iranian nuclear deal, it is worth analyzing the Iran contra-dictions, asking what, if anything, has changed.\n\nThirty years ago, while recuperating in the hospital from colon cancer surgery, Ronald Reagan learned about a zany attempt to free seven American hostages Hezbollah terrorists held. The scheme proposed using Israeli intermediaries to sell arms to Iranian moderates, who promised to improve relations with America once the fiery octogenarian Ayatollah Khomeini died. Desperate to free the hostages and hoping that wooing Iran would confound his main cold War-era enemy, the Soviet Union, Reagan approved.\n\nOn July 17, four days after his intestinal procedure, and 17 days after his most recent public statement vowing \u201cno deals\u201d with terrorists, Reagan wrote in his diary: \u201cSome strange soundings are coming from some Iranians.\u201d These \u201csoundings\u201d led to the first Israeli arms shipments to Iran in August and the release of one hostage by September. This indirect exchange amounted to what the final Iran-Contra report would call \u201can authorized effort to secure the release of American hostages in exchange for shipments of weapons.\u201d Eventually, Iran received 2,008 TOW anti-tank missiles and tons of spare parts. In return, three hostages were freed, although Iranian-supported Hezbollah terrorists kidnapped replacements shortly thereafter.\n\nReagan\u2019s aides tried keeping this initiative secret. In 1980, mocking Jimmy Carter\u2019s wimpiness when Iran held 52 American diplomats and Marines hostage for 444 days, Reagan had vowed never to negotiate with terrorists. Reagan\u2019s cowboys also feared being embarrassed by the crafty, hostile, Iranians whose taqiyya doctrine, or \u201choly dissimulation,\u201d celebrated tricking the West and whose dictatorship thrived by bashing \u201cBig Satan,\u201d meaning the United States, not just \u201cLittle Satan,\u201d meaning Israel.\n\nUnderlying the outreach to Iranian \u201cmoderates\u201d was a traditional, delightfully innocent, American belief in the power of reason and reasonableness.\n\nAn even kookier, riskier scheme intensified this need for subterfuge. Frustrated by congressional bans on funding the Contra insurgency against Nicaragua\u2019s Sandinista government, Colonel Oliver North and others diverted Iranian arms sale profits to bankroll the Contras. Three times, in increasingly global language, the Democratic-dominated Congress had passed a \u201cBoland Amendment\u201d outlawing any Contra funding. Reagan resented the congressional restrictions on those he called \u201cthe moral equivalent of our Founding Fathers.\u201d What became the Iran-Contra scheme unconstitutionally subverted congressional oversight of the Administration\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nInevitably, in fall 1986, a Lebanese newspaper leaked the story, derailing\u2014and almost destroying\u2014Reagan\u2019s presidency. Forced to admit to either a cluelessness that bordered on incompetence or a lawlessness that could be impeachable, Reagan punted. Resenting the pesky congressional restrictions handcuffing him, bleeding politically left and right, Reagan languished for months. In March 1987, he apologized, sort of. In what would become a model of presidential double-speak, Reagan proclaimed: \u201cA few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that\u2019s true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not.\u201d\n\nUltimately, few Americans had the stomach for impeachment a decade after Watergate, while Reagan\u2019s surprising love-in with Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s Soviet Union redeemed his presidency. But the Iran-Contra scandal continues to cloud Reagan\u2019s reputation\u2014and some of its lessons remain relevant.\n\nUnderlying the outreach to Iranian \u201cmoderates\u201d was a traditional, delightfully innocent, American belief in the power of reason and reasonableness. George Washington is remembered for championing an Enlightenment-era neutrality rooted in rationality in his Farewell Address, assuming that most people are good. He advised: \u201cJust and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated.\u201d\n\nSupporters of today\u2019s Iran deal echo Washington\u2019s warning that a nation with permanent enemies\u2014or friends\u2014\u201cis in some degree a slave\u2026. Antipathy in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and intractable, when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur.\u201d\n\nSkeptics, however, note that Jimmy Carter fell for the Iranians\u2019 boombox revolution, overlooking the menacing Islamist fundamentalism in the seemingly benign cassette tapes the Ayatollah Khomeini\u2019s supporters distributed opposing the Shah. Ronald Reagan and his aides fell for Iran\u2019s Diet Coke moderates, who were not \u201cThe real thing.\u201d And, whatever one thinks of the recent agreement, the level of anti-American rhetoric that Tehran is still spewing remains terrifying, especially with four hostages languishing.\n\nObama is banking on a Washingtonian reason to free Americans from considering the Islamic Republic of Iran an enemy; Obama\u2019s critics fear Obama is joining a bipartisan parade of American innocents, who, enthralled by their own goodness, trust others to be equally benign.\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s risky outreach to moderate Iran comes 30 years after Ronald Reagan\u2019s risky outreach to supposed Iranian \u201cmoderates.\u201d Both diplomatic gambles reflect this longstanding American faith in reason and quest for reasonable centrists even amid our sworn enemies. Both express an idealistic faith in diplomacy overriding an equally idealistic faith in defending individuals\u2019 human rights while checking the realists\u2019 pessimism. And both involve presidents trying to maximize their foreign policy prerogatives, dismissing\u2014and in Reagan\u2019s case illegally violating\u2014congressional oversight. Reagan\u2019s initiative quickly degenerated into the Iran-Contra catastrophe. The fate of Obama\u2019s new agreement probably won\u2019t be clear for a while, yet the menace of Iran\u2019s Islamist tyranny clearly persists.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:35.791+0000"}

And if you look at how many stars there are, and how many planets there are that are likely to be around them based on new data, you add all this up and say, \u201cIt would be inexcusably egocentric to suggest that we were the only life in the universe.\u201d That is the posture that informed people take who study this. The prospect of there being life is not an exotic thought.\n\n\u201cSo, you have people who are certain that a man in a robe transforms a cracker into the literal body of Jesus saying that what goes on in Scientology is crazy?\u201d\n\n\n\nDo you feel there\u2019s ever been an \u201cevent\u201d?\n\nWell, with UFOs, we have to remind ourselves what the \u201cU\u201d stands for: Unidentified. For some reason over the decades, people have made the UFO synonymous with intelligent aliens visiting us from another planet in a flying saucer, but if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re looking at, you should just stop talking. The thought should end there. You can\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019m looking at, therefore it must be intelligent aliens from another galaxy visiting Earth.\u201d You have no place to stand to make that claim.\n\nSpeaking of aliens, did you see HBO\u2019s Scientology documentary Going Clear?\n\nNo. I heard about it, though. I\u2019m familiar with it.\n\nI\u2019m curious what your take on Scientology is, because the intergalactic story of Xenu does encroach on your territory a bit.\n\nSo, you have people who are certain that a man in a robe transforms a cracker into the literal body of Jesus saying that what goes on in Scientology is crazy? Let\u2019s realize this: What matters is not who says who\u2019s crazy, what matters is we live in a free country. You can believe whatever you want, otherwise it\u2019s not a free country\u2014it\u2019s something else. If we start controlling what people think and why they think it, we have case studies where that became the norm. I don\u2019t care what the tenets are of Scientology. They don\u2019t distract me. I don\u2019t judge them, and I don\u2019t criticize them.\n\nNow, where the rubber hits the road is, since we are a free country where belief systems are constitutionally protected\u2014provided they don\u2019t infringe on the rights of others\u2014then how do you have governance over \u201call\u201d when you have belief systems for the \u201csome\u201d? It seems to me that the way you govern people is you base governance on things that are objectively true; that are true regardless of your belief system, or no matter what the tenets are of your holy documents. And then they should base it on objective truths that apply to everyone. So the issue comes about not that there are religious people in the world that have one view over another, it\u2019s if you have one view or another based on faith and you want to legislate that in a way that affects everyone. That\u2019s no longer a free democracy. That\u2019s a country where the few who have a belief system that\u2019s not based in objective reality want to control the behavior of everyone else.\n\nThe documentary essentially argues that Scientology shouldn\u2019t be granted tax-exempt status as a religion.\n\nBut why aren\u2019t they a religion? What is it that makes them a religion and others are religions? If you attend a Seder, there\u2019s an empty chair sitting right there and the door is unlocked because Elijah might walk in. OK. These are educated people who do this. Now, some will say it\u2019s ritual, some will say it could literally happen. But religions, if you analyze them, who is to say that one religion is rational and another isn\u2019t? It looks like the older those thoughts have been around, the likelier it is to be declared a religion. If you\u2019ve been around 1,000 years you\u2019re a religion, and if you\u2019ve been around 100 years, you\u2019re a cult. That\u2019s how people want to divide the kingdom. Religions have edited themselves over the years to fit the times, so I\u2019m not going to sit here and say Scientology is an illegitimate religion and other religions are legitimate religions. They\u2019re all based on belief systems. Look at Mormonism! There are ideas that are as space-exotic within Mormonism as there are within Scientology, and it\u2019s more accepted because it\u2019s a little older than Scientology is, so are we just more accepting of something that\u2019s older?\n\n\n\nThe line I\u2019m drawing is that there are religions and belief systems, and objective truths. And if we\u2019re going to govern a country, we need to base that governance on objective truths\u2014not your personal belief system.\n\nThe separation of church and state\u2014which we\u2019re not too great at practicing in this country.\n\nYeah. The Constitution makes no mention of Jesus, God, or anything. The Constitution is religion-free on purpose, which I\u2019ve read was controversial. They were smart. They said, \u201cWell, if we mention god, then it establishes a religion, and that would give the government power to influence your belief system, and you would no longer have a free country.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re seeing it right now with this \u201creligious freedom law\u201d in Indiana.\n\nI just think it\u2019s a little weird that there\u2019s a law that allows you to earn less money. I think that\u2019s weird within a capitalist democracy. If you\u2019re a company and you don\u2019t agree with it, you don\u2019t put your factories there, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s good for your economy. Usually the economy wins in the end in terms of decision-making, so we\u2019ll see what comes of this.\n\nAs a scientist, does homophobia strike you as particularly odd? There are many species within the animal kingdom that are attracted to the same sex, and perhaps if people were more educated in the sciences instead of religious dogma, then there would be less homophobia.\n\nWell, it almost always entirely stems from religion. But the point here is that if you\u2019re religious, and your religion tells you that being gay is bad, then don\u2019t be gay. But you have to remind yourself that that\u2019s your belief system, and there are other belief systems that don\u2019t agree with that, so you should not be in the position to make legislation that affects other people.\n\nI enjoyed your Daily Show riff on The Walking Dead disproving the likelihood of zombies.\n\nEverything I know about The Walking Dead is because my son watched every episode, so he clues me in. They brought me in on it, so I have some fluency in The Walking Dead. I\u2019m intrigued by how they do it. I like watching the odd characters rise up in the face of this apocalyptic Earth, and you know that these people would be there\u2014the people you think you know but you don\u2019t, and there\u2019s something weird about them. That\u2019s what makes the show intriguing\u2014not just learning how people would react in the face of aliens, but how people would react with each other in the face of aliens. That\u2019s what makes it a rich tapestry.\n\nSee any movies recently?\n\nI just saw Whiplash. It was interesting. Here\u2019s why I take issue with it. It\u2019s one jazz musician and one overbearing coach, so I get that, but I come from a world where true success is completely driven from within the individual and not from someone outside of them. While the case portrayed there is some fraction of cases that are out there, at the end of the day, Einstein became Einstein not because someone said, \u201cKeep studying, keep studying!\u201d and someone didn\u2019t say, \u201cIsaac Newton, go invent calculus!\u201d He invented it on his own. So in my world, there is no success without people being self-driven, and to believe that you only achieve greatness because someone pushed you there? I don\u2019t see that. The story was nonetheless intriguing, but I feel it may be the minority of cases who have succeeded in a singular way in life. If someone treats you that way, you may become really good at something but you won\u2019t become the greatest at it, and you\u2019ll resent them and you might even turn away from the subject entirely.\n\nPresident George W. Bush named you to a pair of aerospace commissions, but how do you feel about Bush\u2019s relationship with science? He was also someone who believed in \u201cintelligent design\u201d and is widely known to have suppressed scientific discussion of global warming during his administration.\n\nPeople can say and think what they want, but what matters is whether or not it becomes policy or legislation, and I don\u2019t remember any legislation that restricted science. In fact, the budget for the National Science Foundation went up. What matters is money in Congress. What does Congress do? Allocate money. That\u2019s really what they do. So the science budget of the country went up during the Bush administration, and the budget for NASA went up 3 percent\u2014and it had actually dropped 25 percent in real spending dollars under the eight years of President Clinton. I don\u2019t care what you say or think. I care about legislation, and policy.\n\nAlso, he appointed me! There may have been some science that he hadn\u2019t learned yet or didn\u2019t know fully, but he\u2019s not creating legislation based on it. Speeches are politics, so you can\u2019t fault a politician for saying something political.\n\nI think it\u2019s been proven, though, that the Bush administration was systematically suppressing and altering reports on global warming from the scientific community. This has been proven multiple times.\n\nRight. But did he succeed? He was caught. There were some documents where someone was caught rubbing out the term \u201cbig bang\u201d and it was found, and the guy lost his job. What I\u2019m saying is I\u2019ve become much more pragmatic about all of this. Washington is about politics, and Bush has an electoral base that want him to behave certain ways, but what matters is policy. People were saying there was a \u201cRepublican War on Science,\u201d and I say, \u201cWhat war are you talking about?\u201d And they say, \u201cWell, they\u2019re suppressing stem cell research. Oh, and there\u2019s the environment. And the Republicans are in bed with oil companies.\u201d So I check those boxes and say, \u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Well, no, not really. The budget for the NSF went up. The budget for NASA went up. The budget for the National Institutes of Health that gives grants for health research went up. So it\u2019s not really a war on science. It\u2019s a resistance to things that interfere with their two political agendas: one religion-based, the other oil-based. There it is. It\u2019s called politics.\n\nI really enjoyed Cosmos, and it was such a huge hit. Is it coming back?\n\nWe\u2019re in conversations now, we\u2019re just trying to figure out if we do it again how we would do it, could we do it more efficiently\u2014since the first one was stretched out over such a long period of time, and we were figuring stuff out as we went along. We\u2019re in conversations now, but nothing\u2019s been announced yet. There\u2019s more than 13 hours of universe.

{"entityId": 1959, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The socialist and the billionaire agree on what\u2019s ailing America\u2014and that\u2019s a notion that should scare all of us.\n\nApart from surprising popularity, weird hair, and zero chance at actually becoming president, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could hardly seem more different. One\u2019s a socialist-hating billionaire and the other is a billionaire-hating socialist, right? Yet there they are, delivering boffo poll numbers long after everyone in the smart set had written them off as flashes in the pan.\n\nPerhaps, like Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, they\u2019re not so different after all. Indeed, the unanticipated appeal of Trump and Sanders to Republican and Democratic primary voters comes from the same psychological wellspring. They represent, in the words of Pittsburgh Tribune-Review columnist Salena Zito, \u201cpopulism born of frustration.\u201d They are angry candidates, bitching and moaning about the sorry shape of the United States and they are unabashedly protectionist. Each identifies immigrants and overseas competition as the root cause of most if not all of our problems. They both believe that if only we can wall off the country\u2014literally in The Donald\u2019s case and figuratively in Sanders\u2019\u2014we could \u201cMake America Great Again!\u201d (as Trump puts it in his campaign slogan).\n\nTrump notoriously looks at Mexicans sneaking across the border and sees crime lords, drug dealers, and rapists, though he has magnamimously granted that \u201csome, I assume, are good people.\u201d Sanders, for his part, looks at the same hard cases and sees a reserve army of future wages slaves for the Koch brothers.\n\nIn an interview with Vox, Sanders was asked what he thought about increasing immigration in order to help poor foreigners increase their standard of living. \u201cThat\u2019s a Koch brothers proposal,\u201d he huffed, \u201cThat\u2019s a right-wing proposal, which says essentially there is no United States.\u201d So much for the internationalism and universal brotherhood on which socialism once prided itself.\n\n\n\nBeing anti-immigrant isn\u2019t a new position for Sanders. As Politico noted earlier this year, Sanders\u2019s loyalty to the AFL-CIO and other labor unions undergirds his consistent opposition to opening up borders and his contempt for free-trade agreements.\n\nIn regularly complaining about China, Sanders sounds just like\u2026Donald Trump. Riffing in post-industrial Michigan on August 11, Trump noted China\u2019s currency devaluation and announced, \u201cDevalue means, suck the blood out of the United States!\u201d\n\nFor good measure, Trump also attacked Sanders as a weakling even as he saluted him as a brother in spirit. Commenting on how the Vermont senator lost the microphone to a Black Lives Matter activist at a recent event in Seattle, Trump said, \u201cI felt badly for him, but it showed that he was weak. You know what? He\u2019s getting the biggest crowds, and we\u2019re getting the biggest crowds. We\u2019re the ones getting the crowds.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s most worrisome is that other candidates who are more likely to actually succeed in 2016 will try to win over Trump\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s supporters by co-opting their Fortress America mentality.\n\nIndeed, they are. Even after gracelessly implying Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly suffered from PMS during the first Republican candidates\u2019 debate, Trump leads among GOP voters with 23 percent and Sanders has \u201csurged\u201d ahead of Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire polls.\n\nDespite this, there\u2019s no chance either will win his party\u2019s nomination, much less become president. As Jack Shafer has noted, they are less candidates and more demagogues, who trade in \u201canger and resentment to attract supporters.\u201d Such intensity can get you a hard-core band of supporters\u2014just ask George Wallace or Ross Perot\u2014but it also ultimately limits the broad-based support necessary to pull enough votes even in hotly contested three-way elections.\n\nWhich isn\u2019t to say that Trump and Sanders haven\u2019t already had a major impact. In the early stages of the campaign, they are tapping into immense voter dissatisfaction with not just the Republican and Democratic Party establishments but a 21st-century status quo that is in many ways genuinely depressing and disappointing. Trump and Sanders offer seemingly authentic responses to and truly simplistic solutions for what ails us. Close the borders! Fuck the Chinese!\n\nWhat\u2019s most worrisome is that other candidates who are more likely to actually succeed in 2016 will try to win over Trump\u2019s or Sanders\u2019s supporters by co-opting their Fortress America mentality. All of the GOP contenders except Jeb Bush have called for some type of impenetrable border with Mexico as a precondition for discussing any changes in immigration numbers. By and large, they have also signed on to mandatory use of E-Verify, a national database that would effectively turn work into a government-granted privilege while increasing the reach of the surveillance state.\n\nThough she pushed for President Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal while secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has flip-flopped and now is a critic of the deal. If Sanders continues to eat her lunch or even nibble around its edges through the end of the year, look for her to rethink her generally positive position on immigration too.\n\nTrump\u2019s and Sanders\u2019s appeal isn\u2019t hard to dope out.Twice as many of us\u201460 percent\u2014think the country is headed in the wrong direction as think it\u2019s going in the right direction. Trust in government has been skidding since the 1960s and the general loss of faith has accelerated since the 9/11 attacks. Trump and Sanders speak to our anxieties with a mix of shouty slogans, moral certitude, and magical policies on everything from health care to the minimum wage to ISIS.\n\nIn the current moment, it\u2019s the billionaire and the socialist who feel our pain. But if their Republican and Democratic opponents adopt their xenophobia and protectionist ideas, they will have helped increase our pain long after they\u2019ve inevitability sunk in the polls.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:36.827+0000"}

Let\u2019s see how he does if he runs against an actual Clinton.\n\nLITTLE ROCK, Ark. \u2014 The story of Mike Huckabee is forever intertwined with the Clintons. And it looks like that connection will get deeper after Huckabee\u2019s appearance on FOX News Friday night saying that he plans to announce his White House plans on May 5 in Hope, Ark.\n\nThe choice of Hope is a not-so-subtle jab at Bill Clinton, who, like Huckabee, was born in Hope and who used it strategically as a slogan in his 1992 campaign for president with his slogan: \u201cI Still Believe In A Place Called Hope.\u201d\n\nHuckabee\u2019s nascent campaign offered no details on staffing, but Democrat and Republican sources say that the Huckabee camp has already leased office space in Little Rock. The Washington Post reported earlier on Friday that the former governor told reporters that a Super PAC has been established for his presumed campaign, and that a network of supporters in Iowa was being built up. He\u2019s in New Hampshire tonight.\n\nAnd Huckabee seems like he\u2019s itching for a fight. On April 12, he tweeted to Hillary: \u201cCongrats. Your announcement makes me nostalgic for our days doing political battle in Arkansas\u2026#ImStillStanding.\u201d\n\nBy choosing Hope as the site for his announcement, it appears that he plans to make the Clintons one of his main campaign objectives.\n\n\u201cGovernor Huckabee would be well-equipped to run against the Clinton machine since he has overcome it on several occasions in which he won elections that they campaigned against him or against individuals who he supported,\u201d said Doyle Webb, chairman of the Republican Party of Arkansas.\n\nThe Clinton-Huckabee feud may exist mainly in Huckabee\u2019s head, but there\u2019s little doubt that without the election of Clinton to the White House, Huckabee may never have become governor of Arkansas.\n\nHuckabee became lieutenant governor in a special election in 1993 after Clinton became president. In 1996, Huckabee ascended to the governor\u2019s office when then-Governor Jim Guy Tucker resigned after his conviction in the Whitewater scandal. From there, Huckabee went on to serve from 1996 until 2007 as governor until he was term-limited.\n\n\n\nThe Huckabees moved from Arkansas to Florida in 2010 but have maintained ties in the state through family. Marco Rubio has already claimed Florida, and Arkansas, which is now entirely Republican-controlled, offers Huckabee a spot in Middle America to continue his battle against Hillary Clinton\u2014if he survives a Republican primary\u2014one source said.\n\nJay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College in Conway, Ark., said that the 1993 special election set the stage for a long-standing connection between Huckabee and the Clintons.\n\n\u201cYour announcement makes me nostalgic for our days doing political battle in Arkansas...#ImStillStanding.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that campaign, beginning a theme that he would use throughout his Arkansas career, Huckabee said his campaign was about \u2018unplugging the [state Democratic party] machine\u2019 at a moment of exceptional unpopularity for Clinton nationally,\u201d Barth said. \u201cWhile there really was no \u2018Dem party machine,\u2019 the theme resonated with voters and helped Huckabee eke out a very close win.\u201d\n\nNewspaper articles highlight the long-standing feud between Huckabee and the Clinton machine. A 1993 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled \u201cBill\u2019s Backyard,\u201d said: \u201cMr. Huckabee ran against a Democratic machine that pulled out all the stops against him.\u201d\n\nIn every race Huckabee ran in Arkansas, the Clintons maintained a presence, and Democrats deeply connected to Clinton controlled both chambers of the legislature during Huckabee\u2019s governorship. In 1998, Bill Clinton campaigned for Huckabee\u2019s opponent, Bill Bristow, who was a lawyer for one of Clinton\u2019s state troopers in the Paula Jones saga.\n\nFour years, later in 2002, Clinton\u2019s long-time friend Jimmie Lou Fisher ran against Huckabee but lost. Clinton campaigned on Fisher\u2019s behalf and raised money for her. In that race, Huckabee said, \u201cIf you liked Bill Clinton for 12 years, then elect Jimmie Lou Fisher, because that\u2019s basically what you\u2019re going to have. She\u2019s pretty much listened to him for political strategy, for philosophy, and he\u2019s raised her funds. I think he\u2019s had his turn.\u201d\n\nJanine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas, said that while there is a long history between Huckabee and the Clintons, the feud has been blown out of proportion.\n\n\u201cThe characterization of it as some kind of epic rivalry, though, is likely one-sided,\u201d said Parry. \u201cGovernor Huckabee has tremendous political talent: he\u2019s good one-on-one and (at) working a room. But he hasn\u2019t yet parlayed those talents to the world stage. Hillary has, and for far longer, meaning she probably perceives Huckabee as only a slightly more interesting competitor than any of the apparently dozens of others.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:36.984+0000"}

(Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n\u201cWhen individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they\u2019re not protesting, they\u2019re not making a statement, they\u2019re stealing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not a protest, that is not a statement, it\u2019s people\u2014a handful of people taking advantage of the situation for their own purposes, and they need to be treated as criminals.\u201d\n\nBut he made equally clear that the police cannot be the long-term solution any more than they were the immediate cause of the unrest.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just leave this to the police,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there are police departments that have to do some soul searching. I think there are some communities that have to do some soul searching. But I think we, as a country, have to do some soul searching.\u201d\n\nArrest sheets will indicate how many of the rioters came from the high schools that let out just before the trouble erupted in Baltimore. The demographics of those schools are already well documented.\n\nThe most prestigious of them\u2014as well as the one adjacent to the Mondawmin Mall, where the riot started\u2014is Frederick Douglass High School. Its alumni included not just Cab Calloway and the father of Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, but also Thurgood Marshall, class of 1925.\n\nHe summoned some of his old audacity, the hope that had carried him to the White House.\n\nMarshall went on to successfully argue Brown v. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court, the 1954 case that led to the desegregation of the nation\u2019s public schools. Marshall then became the first African-American Supreme Court justice.\n\nBut 60 years after official end of segregation, the 789 students at Marshall\u2019s alma mater are 99 percent minority, only a couple of whites more than when there were none at all.\n\nWhat has changed is that most of the middle-class black families that once filled the surrounding neighborhood have moved away. They were largely replaced by the poor\u2014working and non-working.\n\nOf the present students at Frederick Douglass, 83 percent are listed in a U.S. News and World Report index as economically disadvantaged. Only 53 percent are listed as proficient in English, just 44 percent proficient in algebra.\n\nThe worst kind of example was set by former principal Antonio Hurt, who was convicted last year of stealing nearly $2 million from a program intended to feed disadvantaged children. He had diverted the funds to his pocket, buying bling and fancy automobiles.\n\nGALLERY: Scenes From the Chaos in Baltimore (PHOTOS)\n\n\n\nBrendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty\n\nThe present principal, Iona Spikes, is a decided improvement. She was unavailable for comment yesterday, not answering calls placed at her home and office. All of the city\u2019s schools were closed yesterday.\n\nThat included the other high schools in the vicinity of the Mondawmin Mall.\n\nCarver Vocational-Technical High is 100 percent minority, with 79 percent of the students economically disadvantaged.\n\nCoppin Academy is 100 percent minority, with 77 percent economically disadvantaged,\n\nInstitute of Business and Entrepreneurship is 98 percent minority, with 97 percent economically disadvantaged.\n\nBaltimore Civitas is 99 percent minority, with 77 percent economically disadvantaged.\n\nConnexions Community Leadership Academy is 98 percent minority, with 76 percent economically disadvantaged.\n\nSuch numbers and the social ills that accompany them are well known to our president. But he has seldom addressed them with the clarity and forthrightness he demonstrated in the Rose Garden on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cThis is not new,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for decades. And without making any excuses for criminal activities that take place in these communities, what we also know is that if you have impoverished communities that have been stripped away of opportunity, where children are born into abject poverty; they\u2019ve got parents, often, because of substance abuse problems or incarceration or lack of education themselves, who can\u2019t do right by their kids.\u201d\n\nHe cited the equation of what he termed a \u201cslow-rolling crisis\u201d that nobody should report as new.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more likely that those kids end up in jail or dead, than that they go to college. In communities where there are no fathers who can provide guidance to young men. Communities where there\u2019s no investment and manufacturing\u2019s been stripped away. And drugs have flooded the community, and the drug industry ends up being the primary employer for a whole lot of folks.\u201d\n\nHe charged on.\n\n\u201cIf we are serious about solving this problem, then we\u2019re going to not only have to help the police, we\u2019re going to think about what can we do, the rest of us, to make sure that we\u2019re providing early education to these kids, to make sure that we\u2019re reforming our criminal justice system so it\u2019s not just a pipeline from schools to prisons, so that we\u2019re not rendering men in these communities unemployable because of a felony record for a non-violent drug offense; that we\u2019re making investments so that they can get the training they need to find jobs.\u201d\n\nHe summoned some of his old audacity, the hope that had carried him to the White House. He sounded as if he belonged there.\n\n\u201cBut if we really want to solve the problem, if our society really wanted to solve the problem, we could. It\u2019s just it would require everybody saying this is important, this is significant, and that we don\u2019t just pay attention to these communities when a CVS burns and we don\u2019t just pay attention when a young man gets shot or has his spine snapped. We\u2019re paying attention all the time because we consider those kids our kids and we think they\u2019re important and they shouldn\u2019t be living in poverty and violence.\u201d\n\nObama apologized to Abe for having spoken so long in response to a lone query about Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Mr. Prime Minister, but this is a pretty important issue for us,\u201d Obama said, adding at the end, \u201cThat was a really long answer, but I felt pretty strongly about it.\u201d\n\nToo bad he did not say more sooner.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:37.199+0000"}

They took the bait, and after he released the footage, ACORN collapsed.\n\nHis other perpetually-costumed truth hunts have failed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about the willingness to break the law,\u201d O\u2019Keefe told the room full of reporters on Tuesday.\n\nIn 2010, he was arrested in New Orleans for trying to make illegal recordings at Democratic Senator Mary Landrieu\u2019s office. Two of the activists accompanying him were dressed up as telephone repairmen. In 2014, he donned an Osama Bin Laden mask and crossed the U.S.-Mexico border to prove how easy it is (Bin Laden had been dead, by this point, for three years).\n\nO\u2019Keefe says he\u2019s a journalist who wants to expose \u201cwaste, fraud, abuse, corruption, dishonesty and malfeasance in society,\u201d but he is, at his core, a showman. And if it weren\u2019t so goddamn funny, the \u201cbombshell\u201d he dropped on Tuesday wouldn\u2019t have been much of a show at all.\n\nTo the right of O\u2019Keefe\u2019s stage was a TV airing footage from inside Hillary Clinton\u2019s June 7 campaign launch on Roosevelt Island. The camera focused unsteadily, like a scene out of the Blair Witch Project, on Clinton\u2019s merchandise booth, where her campaign sold T-shirts and buttons.\n\n\u201cHi, can I get a hat and a rainbow button, please?\u201d O\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover agent, a female whose name he refused to reveal, asked.\n\nO\u2019Keefe, narrating the video, informed us that two women working the booth were in fact high-ranking Clinton staffers: Molly Barker, the national director of marketing for the campaign, and Erin Tibe, the campaign\u2019s national compliance manager.\n\nAnd then, the bombshell.\n\nWhen O\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover agent approached the merchandise booth, she found herself standing next to a Canadian tourist. But when it came the tourist\u2019s turn to make her purchase, there was an issue: Campaigns cannot legally accept donations from non-U.S. citizens.\n\nO\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover agent, apparently outraged on the Canadian woman\u2019s behalf, protested: \u201cShe traveled all the way from Canada to support Hillary!\u201d\n\nBut the Canadian woman, whose identity O\u2019Keefe said is unknown (he claims his organization tried to track her down, but was unsuccessful), had a solution: O\u2019Keefe\u2019s undercover agent could just take her money and make the purchase for her.\n\nUpon this suggestion, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s agent asked Barker, \u201cCanadians can\u2019t buy them, but Americans can buy it for them?\u201d\n\nBarker replied, \u201cNot technically. You would just be making the donation.\u201d\n\nUnder a false name, according to O\u2019Keefe, his agent gave the campaign $75 in cash.\n\n\u201cThese senior Hillary campaign officials are not rookies,\u201d O\u2019Keefe narrated. \u201cThey know the ins and outs of the election code, and we\u2019ve shown you that they\u2019re willing to break the law.\u201d\n\nHe ended the video with a promise: There would be more bombshells like this one. \u201cStay tuned, Hillary, and check your email,\u201d he joked.\n\nThe video ended with AOL\u2019s \u201cYou\u2019ve got mail\u201d alert.\n\nTo O\u2019Keefe, this footage is proof that the Clinton campaign is inclined toward criminal behavior. \u201cIt\u2019s about the willingness to break the law,\u201d he told the room full of reporters on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the amount of money.\u201d\n\nBut there is a problem: If Clinton\u2019s campaign broke the law, so did O\u2019Keefe\u2019s organization.\n\nA close reading of the Federal Election Commission\u2019s campaign finance laws makes it clear that campaigns cannot \u201csolicit or accept\u201d donations from foreign nationals, and that individuals cannot \u201cknowingly provide substantial assistance\u201d by \u201cacting as a conduit or intermediary for foreign national contributions and donations.\u201d Individuals can\u2019t legally make donations under a false name, either, meaning that if you\u2019re keeping score: Clinton\u2019s campaign appears to have violated the law once, and O\u2019Keefe\u2019s organization twice.\n\nThe FEC said they couldn\u2019t comment on O\u2019Keefe\u2019s video because in order to determine whether or not the law was broken, someone would need to file a complaint against the Clinton campaign and the FEC would need to vote on whether or not they violated the law. Even if O\u2019Keefe did file a complaint, this would never happen because the FEC is dysfunctional.\n\nBut O\u2019Keefe admitted to reporters that he didn\u2019t contact the FEC and he doesn\u2019t have plans to file a complaint. Instead, he sent a letter to Clinton\u2019s campaign, in which he seeks to have them return the $75 (though, since O\u2019Keefe doesn\u2019t know who the Canadian tourist is, it seems unlikely that the money will ever be returned to her).\n\nAsked by The Washington Post\u2019s Dana Milbank if they were admitting to breaking the law, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s lawyer said that their offenses were illegal, too, yes, but akin to \u201cjaywalking.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s offenses, though, are gravely criminal. How this adds up, it\u2019s not clear.\n\nPaul Ryan, of the Campaign Legal Center, told me that according to my description of the video, it seemed O\u2019Keefe\u2019s staffer violated the law, and so did Clinton\u2019s staffers who knew the money came from the Canadian tourist.\n\nClinton\u2019s campaign has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nAfter his bombshell revelation, I asked O\u2019Keefe the obvious question: \u201cIs this a joke? It feels like a prank.\u201d\n\nHe replied, \u201cIs this a joke? Well, the Clin\u00adton cam\u00adpaign doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a joke, be\u00adcause they\u2019re talk\u00ading to The Wash\u00ading\u00adton Post about it. And we sent the let\u00adter to the Clin\u00adton cam\u00adpaign, so no, this is not a joke.\u201d\n\nAfter stumbling through questions for half an hour and failing to make a convincing case that this was the \u201cbombshell\u201d he promised, O\u2019Keefe\u2019s spokesperson asked, \u201cOlivia, do you have a follow-up?\u201d\n\nYeah, I said, were they sure this wasn\u2019t a joke?\n\nO\u2019Keefe, now defensive, gave his soaring answer while maintaining eye contact. \u201cWell, you know, I understand where you\u2019re coming from. You\u2019re trying to use ridicule, and I appreciate that\u2026The Hillary campaign disagrees with you. They disagree with you. And I think a lot of people in this room also disagree with you\u2026And I promise you that in the next couple years we\u2019re going to have an army of people, 100 people, across the country investigating everything. And when that happens? These politicians are going to clean up their act. We\u2019re going to create an army of exposers and if you are lying or stealing or cheating, we are going to find you and make you an unwilling Internet celebrity. I\u2019m telling you that right now. And I\u2019m very excited because this is just the beginning! We\u2019ve got more. Every few days we\u2019re gonna release another tape.

Eight years later, he has changed his tune to match the rest of the Republican field.\n\nIn 2007, Rand Paul gave his first interview to Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist radio host and founder of Infowars.com.\n\nPaul was helping his father, then-Congressman Ron Paul, campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and, Jones said, the entirety of his audience helped to make up the elder Paul\u2019s base of fervent supporters.\n\nJones was struck by the younger Paul\u2019s similarity to his father. \u201cYou know, talking to you, you sound so much like your dad,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThis is great! We have, like, a Ron Paul clone!\u201d\n\nWhen Jones noted that the elder Paul was the only anti-war candidate, Rand replied, \u201cI tell people in speeches, I say you know, we\u2019re against the Iraq war, we have been since the beginning, but we\u2019re also against the Iran war\u2014you know, the one that hasn\u2019t started yet. You know, the thing is I think people want to paint my father into some corner, but if you look at it, intellectually, look at the evidence that Iran is not a threat.\u201d\n\nAs evidence of this, he said, you needn\u2019t look further than the fact that\n\n\u201cIran cannot even refine their own gasoline.\u201d\n\nAnd further, Paul said, \u201ceven our own intelligence community consensus opinion now is that they\u2019re not a threat. My dad says, they don\u2019t have an air force! They don\u2019t have a navy! You know, it\u2019s ridiculous to think that they\u2019re a threat to our national security. It\u2019s not even that viable to say they\u2019re a threat to Israel. Most people say Israel has 100 nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nEight years later, Paul\u2019s beliefs are very different.\n\n\u201cEven our own intelligence community consensus opinion now is that they're not a threat.\u201d Rand 2007\n\nIn response to the agreement reached Tuesday between Iran, the United States, the UK, France, China, Russia and Germany to diminish Iran\u2019s nuclear program, Paul, now the junior Senator from Kentucky and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, released a statement outlining his opposition.\n\n\u201cThe proposed agreement with Iran is unacceptable for the following reasons:\n\n1) sanctions relief precedes evidence of compliance\n\n2) Iran is left with significant nuclear capacity\n\n3) it lifts the ban on selling advanced weapons to Iran\n\nI will, therefore, vote against the agreement. While I continue to believe negotiations are preferable to war, I would prefer to keep the interim agreement in place instead of accepting a bad deal.\u201d\n\nAsked how Paul\u2019s position had shifted so dramatically since he was campaigning for his father, Doug Stafford, his senior campaign adviser, said, \u201cForeign policy should reflect events and events change. Senator Paul has always thought Iran getting a nuclear weapon was a bad idea and dangerous. But over the last eight years, as Iran has made progress in their nuclear enrichment program, it\u2019s become more of a threat. Not allowing your opinions to reflect changing threats would be foolish.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s just frankly not true, as the Alex Jones interview demonstrates.\n\nWhat is true is that the Iran deal places Paul in an impossible bind. Paul\u2019s positions are usually so nuanced that they escape criticism of flip-flopping, but his shift on Iran is unusually clear\u2014even if it was gradual.\n\nWhether compromise is a wise strategy for Paul in the primary is uncertain. Paul is currently polling at 6.6 percent\u2014behind Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Scott Walker, Marco Rubio, Ben Carson and Mike Huckabee. Paul is not going to vault back into the top tier by siphoning off votes from more establishment candidates, whose supporters will never buy him as one of their own. And he won\u2019t mobilize his libertarian base by taking them for granted.\n\nIn April, reporter David Weigel, outlined in detail Paul\u2019s transformation for Bloomberg Politics. In 2011, while in the Senate, Paul was still vocally opposed to war, telling reporter Zaid Jilani he wanted to \u201cinfluence\u201d Iran instead. In 2012, while again campaigning for his father, he reiterated their anti-war position while clarifying that Ron Paul \u201cdoesn\u2019t want Iran to nuclear weapons\u2026But should they get nuclear weapons, he thinks that there are some choices.\u201d A few weeks later, Paul explained to CNN that when it came to preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, \u201cI did finally come down to the conclusion that doing something was better than doing nothing.\u201d\n\nBy 2013, Paul was saying that \u201cthe most pressing issue of the day\u201d was how to contend with Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and said that although he still did not want war, if he were in the White House while a deal collapsed, \u201cI would say all options are on the table, and that would include military.\u201d\n\nBack in March, Paul was faced with a choice: sign the open letter penned by his Senate colleague, Tom Cotton, which Cotton explicitly said was designed to halt negotiations, or be the only presidential contender in the Senate to not sign it, and risk losing support in the fallout.\n\nDespite the fact that Paul had maintained\u2014and continues to maintain\u2014that he favors negotiations, he compromised and opted for the first choice, contorting himself uncomfortably in his effort to explain his decision and irking some of the longtime libertarian supporters he inherited from his father in the process.\n\nHe has pursued a similar strategy with the deal.\n\nThe Atlantic\u2019s David Frum made what on its face felt like a reckless prediction on Tuesday: \u201cThe Rand Paul Candidacy for the Republican Nomination Is Over.\u201d Frum\u2019s case was that throughout the course of his short Senate career, Paul has been able to carve out space for himself within his party by mostly focusing on the issue of domestic surveillance, which comfortably placed him in opposition to the hawks he bemoans and to President Obama. The deal presented for Paul a no-win: Were he to support the deal, however, Frum argued, he would \u201cfind himself isolated with the old Ron Paul constituency,\u201d but were he to oppose it, he would vanish amid a sea of similar voices in the primary field.\n\nThe best explanation for Paul\u2019s new position may come from Paul himself.\n\nIn an interview with The Today Show\u2019s Savannah Guthrie in April, the same day two attack ads were released tying him to Obama on the issue, Paul said, \u201c2007 was a long time ago and events do change over long periods of time. We\u2019re talking about a time when I wasn\u2019t running for office, when I was helping someone else run for office.\u201d\n\nSo when the facts change\u2014be they the facts of the issue at hand or the facts of Paul\u2019s personal political objectives\u2014Paul changes his mind.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:38.762+0000"}
{"entityId": 1964, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The handshake between corporate and religious conservatives has sustained the GOP for decades. Are the corporatists changing sides?\n\nThe Republican governor of that reddest of red states, Arkansas, just refused to sign the anti-gay Religious Freedom Restoration law his Republican legislature produced. Wal-Mart, the second-largest employer in the state (after the government itself), told him not to. This would be newsworthy in itself.\n\nEven more important than this victory is that it is the first real crack in the deal that built the Republican revival of the last nearly 40 years: secular capitalists and religious fundamentalists agreeing on the marriage of free-market economics and a conservative religious social order.\n\nAs early as the mid 1970s, secular conservatives like Howard Phillips and Richard Viguerie consciously undertook to make a coalition with the religious right and succeeded beyond all imagining. Sincere or not, each party agreed to embrace the others\u2019 agenda, and they began to win elections. Probably nothing has been more central to the movement\u2014and the Republican Party\u2019s\u2014success than the stability of that deal. Much evidence suggests that neither faction really embraces its partners\u2019 programs. But sincerity is not the currency of electoral politics. As long as the two parts of the Republican machine held together, progressive politics did not stand a chance.\n\nNo one represents the fruits of that electoral bargain better than the players in Arkansas: religious fundamentalists behind the last-ditch defense against LGBT victory in the name of \u201creligious freedom\u201d on the one hand and the lowest of low-wage employers, Wal-Mart, on the other. This week it cracked wide open. Deliciously, the breach happened at the behest of the LGBT movement, a tiny minority, underfunded, and still often closeted. Wal-Mart told the religious freedom crew to stop the restoration.\n\nThe Arkansas Moment may have taken some by surprise, but it was completely predictable. In 2012, former Solicitor General Paul Clement, a leading partner in the uber-establishment law firm King & Spalding, agreed to represent the Republican House of Representatives in fighting for the Defense of Marriage Act in the Supreme Court. By the time the firm\u2019s largest client (Coca-Cola) called to ask King & Spalding what they could have been thinking, LGBT operatives were already preparing a law school campaign to ensure that K&S would never again hire a desirable young associate. Days later, management magically found that Clement had not followed the proper procedure when he agreed to take the case. The ink was still wet on the Human Rights Campaign signs (\u201cShame on you King & Spalding\u201d) when Clement quit his job.\n\nAs early as the mid 1970s, secular conservatives like Howard Phillips and Richard Viguerie consciously undertook to make a coalition with the religious right and succeeded beyond all imagining.\n\nHow did the LGBT movement achieve the great progressive triumph? Victory has a thousand parents.\n\nImportantly, a thousand fathers. No. 1, gay people are increasingly mainstreamed into corporate America. Sure, Apple\u2019s Tim Cook was nominally in the closet, but as he even acknowledged in coming out recently, everyone knew. And still he rose. He was not alone. Many American companies have LGBT employee affinity groups, and many of those employees occupy critical positions in their businesses. They are the business manifestation of the old Gay Liberation motto, \u201cJust come out!\u201d The flipping of the business community is a particular example of the impact of people coming out in all parts of life. But once the mostly male LGBT people scaled the ramparts of rampant capitalism, their presence turned the force of the market actors against their old conservative ally.\n\nTwo, relentless, brilliant management of the new political weapon of social media and the bottom-up threat of real boycotts. Katie Blair, the young, savvy advocacy coordinator at the Indiana ACLU, has a communications degree from the University of Missouri. Within days of Indiana moving on the RFRA, the hashtag #boycottIndiana was trending on Twitter. Arkansas happens to be the home state of activist Chad Griffin, president of the largest LGBT organization, the Human Rights Campaign. As soon as the RFRA action moved to Arkansas, pictures of Chad\u2019s mother demonstrating against the law went viral on the Internet.\n\nSome economic institutions are fragile, as the panic at King & Spalding reflected. Southern-based, family-owned businesses like Chick-fil-A might be able to resist a gay boycott, but most institutions seek a broader market. Fragile, low-wage Arkansas isn\u2019t California. It doesn\u2019t have a million employers. They need customers, and, like King & Spalding, they need people to want to work for them.\n\nThird and maybe most importantly, the LGBT movement has conquered the moral high ground. Once, the religious had an iron grip on the moral high ground. Religion was for most of human history the source of most moral teaching. Initially, only the religious right used moral arguments\u2014\u201clife\u201d against \u201cconvenience\u201d for women seeking abortions, \u201cfamily,\u201d \u201cdefense\u201d of marriage. But in time the marriage equality activists took a moral stance in favor of love and commitment in the marriage arena. Now the gay revolutionaries have broadened the argument in the most ambitious way. It\u2019s \u201cdiscrimination\u201d that\u2019s immoral again in America. Anti-discrimination is the new moral high ground.\n\nYou can see it in the statements the businesses put out. They aren\u2019t saying, although it is true and is not shameful, that they are looking after the bottom line. They see themselves as noble defenders of right and justice. As Arne Sorenson, president of Marriott Hotels, put it: \u201cThe law is not just pure idiocy from a business perspective\u2026 to discriminate against people just because of who they are, it\u2019s madness.\u201d\n\nNow of course it is possible that the Republicans can patch the alliance together again. They\u2019ve done it before. Attention will lag. But the religionists have gone more and more to their corner of the culture and business has spread more and more to every corner of the culture. With every move, the gap widens. The LGBT movement saw it happening and is exploiting it brilliantly.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:39.013+0000"}
{"entityId": 1965, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "We\u2019ve told you before about our funny Muslims poster campaign. It was all set. Then the MTA changes the rules. So now it\u2019s off to court.\n\nThe MTA does NOT want riders to laugh. No joviality on the 6 train platform, no smirking on that long connection from the F to the 7, no guffaws, chuckling, chortling, or even wide-mouthed smiling. And we learned that the hard way, because we tried to put up funny posters about a marginalized group throughout the New York City subway system, and the MTA took out a large hook and pulled us off stage.\n\nThe Fighting-Bigotry-with-Delightful-Posters Campaign was an outgrowth of our 2013 comedy documentary, The Muslims are Coming!, which used comedy to counter the nation\u2019s Muz-haters. Part of the reason we launched this poster campaign was in hopes of getting more people to check out our film, which stars luminaries like The Daily Show\u2019s Jon Stewart, Rachel Maddow, Lewis Black, David Cross, Russell Simmons, Janeane Garafalo and oh-my-God could this name drop be any longer!? (If you haven't seen the film on Netflix, then stop reading this now and go watch it\u2014we\u2019ll wait. Or download the film for $4.99 on iTunes. We\u2019ll still wait.)\n\nSix months ago we approached the MTA to put up funny ads about Muslims in subway stops. At the time a certain anti-Muslim bigot\u2014whom we won\u2019t mention because why add to this person\u2019s Internet fame?\u2014was going to put up a second series of anti-Muslim ads throughout the NYC transit system, or maybe it was the fourth series, who can keep track?\n\nThanks to the kindness of strangers, coupled with the sheer power of groveling, we raised $19,000 for an MTA ad buy and printing costs. We were relieved. Finally we could get our posters up! Posters like, \u201cThe Ugly Truth About Muslims: They have great frittata recipes.\u201d Or a poster declaring: \u201cBeware! The Muslims Are Coming! And they shall strike with hugs so fierce that you\u2019ll end up calling your grandmother and telling her you love her!\u201d\n\nBut raising the money wasn\u2019t the hard part. The hard part was dealing with the MTA. They red-lined the pants out of our ads. For example, we had small print along the bottom of the posters that said \u201cDraw your penis here________,\u201d\u2014you know, because subway posters are like a penis-drawing invitational so we figured we would get ahead of it by satirizing the practice. \u201cNuh-uh,\u201d said the MTA. Not only that, they made us change fonts! Over 25 percent of our ad was a disclaimer! We couldn\u2019t even use the word \u201cpoop\u201d!\n\nThe MTA\u2019s editing torture went on for months. At the third month, we reached out to the New York City Public Advocate, Letitia James, for help. Thankfully, James and her staff did just that, and finally our ads were approved in early April. We were told that come April 28, 2015, funny Muslim ads would be gracing 140 subway stations. New Yorkers would really know about our thing with frittatas. The MTA even gave us a list of each and every station where our posters could be seen.\n\nWe gleefully printed 144 posters and delivered them to the MTA at a cost of $4,000. We also paid their $15,000 ad space fee. (We stifled vomiting because that\u2019s like several months rent and an untold number of Mister Softee cones.) There we were the night before the posters were scheduled to go up, excited like a coupla kids about to go trick-or-treating. The media was even covering the rollout, there was so much anticipation.\n\nBut on April 28, the posters were nowhere to be found. The next day, still no posters. Then, we did what any comedian would do, we began freaking out. Was the MTA reneging on its promise? Did the legal department just realize they had approved ads that might make straphangers actually laugh?\n\nThen on April 29, the MTA changed its regulations about acceptable posters. The new policy restricted \u201cdisputed political content\u201d\u2014maybe the MTA considers Muslims who like frittatas \u201cdisputed political content.\u201d Our freakout escalated. How could these new rules apply to a decision made a month before? Had the MTA developed time travel? Is any of this fair?\n\nBut the words \"fair\" and \u201cMTA\u201d don\u2019t go together (unless you are talking about \u201cfare,\u201d since the MTA is raising it again). On May 7, more than a month after the ads were approved, after we had entered into a contract and spent over $19,000, we were officially told by the MTA lawyers: Sorry, no funny Muslims ads for you.\n\nThen on April 29, the MTA changed its regulations about acceptable posters. The new policy restricted \u201cdisputed political content\u201d\u2014maybe the MTA considers Muslims who like frittatas \u201cdisputed political content.\u201d\n\nWe tried to reason with the MTA. We tried appealing to their sense of fairness. We even tried groveling. But to no avail. MTA lawyers made it clear that our ads, ads intended to show that Muslims are ordinary people with a sense of humor (and a sense of hummus), had no place in their New York City subway system.\n\nWhat\u2019s a comedian to do? A) Forget about the project; B) sneak into the subway at night and put the posters up using Elmer\u2019s glue; C) use the posters as giant coasters; or D) file a lawsuit against the MTA. We chose D.\n\nThe Fighting-Bigotry-With-Delightful-Posters Campaign has morphed into the Fighting-the-MTA-with-a-Delightful-Lawsuit Campaign. So on Thursday, June 25, 2015, with the good people at Muslim Advocates and the law firm of Latham & Watkins, we filed a lawsuit against the MTA.\n\nWhat do we want from them? We want to ride the subway for free forever. But that\u2019s not part of our lawsuit. We are asking that the MTA live up to its promise and put up our posters.\n\nWe\u2019re not anti-MTA. The MTA gets us to work on time (almost) every day. It\u2019s a sorely needed public service for millions of New Yorkers. You can eavesdrop on some of the best conversations on a subway platform! The subway is GREAT. But on this score, the MTA is wrong.\n\nOur lawsuit will travel through the legal system slower than the G train. But at least it\u2019s moving. The hope is that in the near future you will see funny posters about Muslims in the New York City subway system. In the meantime, why not check out our film, The Muslims are Coming!

But if she raises $2.5 billion and gets to the White House, she\u2019ll have Citizens United to thank!\n\nDuring Hillary Clinton\u2019s first campaign event in Iowa, the (finally) announced presidential candidate laid out the four main goals of her campaign, including the need to fix our \u201cdysfunctional\u201d political system and to get \u201cunaccountable\u201d money out of politics, even if it requires a constitutional amendment. And thus we have the latest chapter in Clinton\u2019s unique and evolving relationship with Citizens United v. Federal Exchange Commission.\n\nIt may be easy to forget that the basis for the claim that led to the controversial Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. FEC was a barely watchable film titled Hillary: The Movie, featuring prominent conservatives such as Dick Morris and Ann Coulter that was trying to damage Hillary Clinton on eve of the January 2008 Democratic presidential primaries. The film was produced by Citizens United, a D.C.-based conservative nonprofit organization.\n\nThe film was supposed to be distributed on cable television and video on demand, but the federal government blocked the airing of the film because it violated the McCain-Feingold Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 that prohibited corporate and nonprofit funded advocacy ads that mentioned a candidate\u2019s name within 30 days of a primary or caucus, or 60 days of a general election.\n\nAt the time, no one could have predicted that Clinton would finish third in the Iowa caucuses behind Barack Obama and John Edwards, so many conservatives thought that more than just attack ads would be needed to defeat her eventual rise to the presidency: Attack movies were the new and necessary medium.\n\nWell, roughly a year into President Obama\u2019s first term, the Supreme Court made its decision on Citizens United v. FEC, saying that certain provisions in the McCain-Feingold BCRA were unconstitutional, and this brought us into the modern era of a nearly unrestricted and confusing flow of cash into our electoral process through various 501(c)(4)s, PACs, and Super PACs.\n\nStephen Colbert may have actually best explained how this absurd network of constantly flowing political money works when he announced on his show that he was officially forming an exploratory committee for his potential candidacy for President of the United States of South Carolina, and therefore could no longer run his Super PAC. See the videos here and here.\n\nAnd here we are today. Less than a week into Clinton\u2019s second official presidential bid, she has already done two things that may completely alter Citizens United v. FEC and our electoral process. Her support of a constitutional amendment limiting or regulating campaign finance is a smart and popular decision among liberal voters, but her campaign\u2019s announcement that it intends to raise a staggering $2.5 billion combined by the official campaign, Hillary for America, and various unaffiliated 501(c)(4)s, PACs, and Super PACs has completely altered our political landscape.\n\nRoughly eight months before the Iowa caucuses, the fundraising machine that will drive or greatly influence Clinton\u2019s campaign has set goals that dwarf those of Obama\u2019s in 2012, and may scare away potential Democratic challengers.\n\nAll told these fundraising efforts may make her the unstoppable, inevitable candidate that she wanted to be in 2008.\n\nThe 2012 presidential election between President Obama and challenger Mitt Romney was the most expensive campaign in history, with each candidate\u2019s election team and supporting groups raising $1.123 and $1.019 billion respectively. Clinton\u2019s campaign intends to surpass that entire amount on its own, and she is allowed to do so because of a case brought to the Supreme Court because a conservative group wanted to have a larger impact on hopefully preventing her from winning the presidency in 2008. The irony is so rich.\n\nWho knows if Clinton will be able to defeat the GOP and Republicans at the game they insisted on creating, but she most likely will at least be able to match them dollar-for-dollar in the general election.\n\nThe brilliance surrounding all of this is the fact that Clinton has steadfastly been against this sort of external influence into politics. She articulated her objections on her first day of campaigning in Iowa, and the main reason why campaign finance laws have changed in recent years was due to her objection to the previously unlawful attempt to disseminate a campaign attack video denouncing her in 2008.\n\nClearly, her campaign\u2019s $2.5 billion fundraising estimate may point to the contrary, but the fundraising strategy of her campaign is actually based around small donations. Additionally, she has not named a finance chair for her campaign.\n\nAccording to an internal campaign memo obtained by Politico, Hillary for America intends to have a \u201cflat fundraising structure\u201d and a \u201cgrassroots donor base and a merit-based finance organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe campaign will have the resources needed to compete,\u201d continued the memo. \u201cInitially fundraising will be a challenge\u2014with lower limits and a smaller list than Obama in 2011.\u201d\n\nThe campaign has moved away from her 2008 strategy of seeking mega-donors, but it also knows that it has the support of unaffiliated organizations such as Ready PAC, formerly Ready for Hillary, that desperately want a Hillary Clinton presidency. (According to FEC regulations, Ready for Hillary was forced to change its name once Clinton officially announced her candidacy.)\n\nArguably against the wishes of many Clinton supporters, two Clinton 2008 volunteers launched Ready for Hillary in 2013 and have raised more than $15 million for Clinton\u2019s campaign and amassed a 4 million strong grassroots fundraising list that will be given to Hillary for America. Clinton\u2019s campaign has already hired six Ready for Hillary staffers, including co-founder Adam Parkhomenko. These former staffers can no longer coordinate with remaining staffers, and Ready PAC intend to shut down completely in the coming days.\n\nEssentially, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign can develop only the fundraising strategy that the candidate supports, but the numerous other political groups that independently support her can fundraise how they see fit. Independent of each other they all collectively believe that these various efforts should enhance candidate Clinton\u2019s chances of moving back into 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAll told these fundraising efforts may make her the unstoppable, inevitable candidate that she wanted to be in 2008. The big difference now is that she did not have Citizens United v. FEC to support her campaign.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton becomes the 45th president of the United States, the GOP may want to give themselves a nice pat on the back for all the hard work they indirectly have done to fund her presidential campaign.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:40.014+0000"}

Experts say that millions of mines are in place, and they are systematically replaced by both sides of the conflict.\n\nSome of the civilian death toll comes from the fact that South Korea\u2019s mines can move due to heavy rain and landslides. Many more mines have been hidden in other areas for years, and the military simply does not know where they are. For example, a South Korean farmer fell victim to a landmine while plowing his field in 2013.\n\n\u201cI just can\u2019t imagine what it was like for the parents of those children,\u201d Craig said this week, referring to the people in a mined area in Cambodia. \u201cI think that\u2019s what struck me most, the fear of\u2026unexploded ordnance that\u2019s just littered around after conflict.

Loudspeakers alternated between blasting the country's newly composed national anthem and President Obama\u2019s \u201cYes We Can\u201d speech. For many South Sudanese, the speech, with its references to slaves and abolitionists, resonated at a visceral level.\n\nNow, nineteen months into a new civil war, as President Obama lands in neighboring Kenya, that marketplace and the dream of a peaceful future for the world\u2019s newest country lies in ruin.\n\nMalakal, which sits at the gateway of South Sudan\u2019s remaining productive oil fields, has become the most visible prize of a war that cannot be won through armed combat, yet continues to be fought with increasing ferocity. South Sudan\u2019s warring sides have exchanged control of the town at least 10 times. Malakal\u2019s diverse population has been forced to flee, leaving its market a charred and empty shell.\n\nPresident Obama will not be far from refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia housing tens of thousands of women and children displaced by South Sudan's war.\n\nOver 20,000 people who speak five different languages live huddled together in a little over a half square mile at a UN peacekeeping base. South Sudan\u2019s national anthem, with its pledge to \u201cuphold us in peace and harmony,\u201d has been discarded. The clarion call that \u201cyes we can\u201d represented to so many is being ignored by leaders who used their power to accumulate wealth instead of building a nation.\n\n\n\nPresident Obama will not be far from refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia housing tens of thousands of women and children displaced by South Sudan\u2019s war. He is meeting with two of the heads of state currently mediating South Sudan\u2019s peace efforts and is addressing the African Union on issues of regional security.\n\nTo maximize impact, President Obama should work with South Sudan\u2019s neighbors to dismantle the complex system of corruption and illicit financial flows that are funding and profiting from the conflict in South Sudan. In addition, by making a public commitment to a hybrid court, with international judges, an investigative wing and jurisdiction over economic crimes, President Obama will help combat what has become an accountability-free zone.\n\nThis week, Human Rights Watch published evidence of brutal gang rapes, unlawful killings of civilians, and the deliberate destruction of seeds intended for planting as a part of the South Sudanese government\u2019s recent scorched earth campaign. Previous reports from the UN peacekeeping mission\u2019s human rights division have implicated the armed opposition in cold-blooded massacres at hospitals and mosques. Without clear financial and legal consequences for those directing and fueling atrocities, abuses like these will continue.\n\nPresident Obama can also bring new energy to the UN's multilateral asset freeze and travel ban regime for South Sudan, which recently added six military commanders from the government and opposition to its sanctions list. To build on this momentum, President Obama should encourage his counterparts in the region to ensure asset freezes and travel bans are enforced in their countries and urge them to support a new round of high-level designations against politically influential individuals and their enablers.\n\nIn South Sudan, targeting field commanders alone is ineffective. The country\u2019s political elites who are responsible for the looting of South Sudan\u2019s natural resource wealth, however, are much more vulnerable to international financial pressure. President Obama should also urge regional leaders to support an arms embargo to limit the warring parties\u2019 access to military hardware used to attack civilians.\n\nBeyond this, billions in oil revenues have been stolen from the country\u2019s treasury and stashed abroad. The real leverage over South Sudan's elites will come through a transnational effort to trace, seize, and return these ill-gotten gains to the people of South Sudan. President Obama can jumpstart this effort by urging Kenya and Ethiopia to share intelligence about stolen money. At the same time, he should prioritize support to the Department of Justice\u2019s Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative as it seeks to identify actionable cases of grand corruption from South Sudan with a strong connection to the United States.\n\nFinally, President Obama should use his trip to pressure Kenya and Uganda to adjust their laws to increase transparency about the real owners of corporate assets and trusts. In his public remarks, he could connect the proliferation of shell companies and tax havens in Africa with the broader problem the continent faces with the massive illicit financial outflows, now more than double what Africa receives in foreign aid. A global push for greater ownership transparency, including a strong final rule from the Department of the Treasury in August to implement greater customer due diligence transparency in the United States, will help ensure that sanctions enforcement and asset recovery efforts are not stymied by anonymous companies and opaque business records.\n\nThe hope that filled the South Sudanese at the cusp of independence has been replaced with utter despair at their leaders\u2019 shameless corruption, tit-for-tat scorched earth campaigns, and the looming threat of famine. South Sudan\u2019s citizens are still waiting for their chance to say \u201cyes we can\u201d to the opportunity and prosperity that independence promised. U.S. leadership on anti-corruption efforts and financial consequences targeting those most responsible for the escalating violence can help make that dream less of a distant reality.\n\n\n\nJohn Prendergast and Akshaya Kumar are Founding Director and Policy Analyst at the Enough Project.

Ted Cruz\u2019s Jesus-huffing father vs Rand Paul\u2019s gold-shilling doomsday dad?\u201d\n\nAmericans are already familiar with Ron Paul\u2019s wild ideas and chin-stroking over his cost-benefit to Rand has been a staple of punditry since Rand first hinted at interest at his own political career.\n\nBut the equally far-from-mainstream opinions of Ted Cruz\u2019s dad, Rafael, are not as familiar to a national audience. But if you haven\u2019t already heard about his Obama conspiracy theories, homophobia or his unusually specific interpretation of Biblical prophecy, don\u2019t fret: Liberal outlets have all put on lobster bibs and staked out space on Rafael\u2019s lawn for what is, in all honesty, probably going to be fantastic television.\n\nYou can already anticipate the pushback to such attacks: They are not their father\u2019s keeper. I would advise the candidates\u2019 offices to draft some fill-in-the-blank press releases (all ending with \u201cdoes not speak for the Senator\u201d) to save time.\n\nThis defense is not just predictable; it has the added advantage of being true. Of course no one is responsible for a family member\u2019s opinions. If everyone in every family agreed on every political issue, then how would we bond with our spouse after Thanksgiving?\n\nThat the Cruzes and the Pauls admittedly endorse each other\u2019s opinions on most issues doesn\u2019t make it any less of a defense. Sure, according to a college friend, Ted\u2019s ideological inclinations were flash-frozen at 18: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing he says today that I didn\u2019t hear in college. It all came from his father and from the Constitutional Corroborators.\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019m willing to believe that he doesn\u2019t agree with his dad that Obama should \u201cgo back to Kenya\u201d (this is, for some reason, the only charge that Cruz\u2019s office has taken an official stance on). I\u2019m also willing to believe that the \u201c99%\u201d of the things Ron and Rand agree on does not include the presumption that Osama bin Laden got a raw deal, or that heroin should be legal.\n\nIf you think it\u2019s even possible that sitting at the knee of Frank Marshall Davis could turn Obama into the Manchurian Candidate, then shouldn\u2019t you care that in the Cruz and Rand households, the ideological indoctrination was intentional, specific, and continued long into adulthood?\n\nBut whatever their differences with their sons, none of those defenses or denials mean Ron Paul and Rafael Cruz opinions shouldn\u2019t matter to the average voter.\n\nWe should care about what Ron Paul and Rafael Cruz believe because, to be frank, young Rand and Ted were not raised like the average voter. Their childhoods and political educations\u2014guided by two fathers of unusually strong opinions and personalities\u2014are mirror images of the Right\u2019s own fantasy about Obama.\n\nThose paranoid fantasies go something like this: Obama was supposedly indoctrinated into virulent anti-colonialism and/or socialism by his father and/or a series of father figures, from the actual Barack Sr. to Frank Marshall Davis to Bill Ayers to Jeremiah Wright. The myth that Obama has a secret ambition to \u201cfundamentally change\u201d the country into a totalitarian dystopia is anchored in the depiction of these men and their dark, conspiratorial theories about the nature of the American project.\n\nGrowing up believing there is pervasive threat laying in wait and a scheme by those in power to keep you down would certainly engender a certain attitude toward government and politics. It\u2019s not the attitude Obama has, however: It\u2019s the one shared by the families Rand and Paul.\n\nThere are few visions of America darker than Ron Paul\u2019s, whose squeaky doomsaying is the stuff of Internet memes. Just this January, he warned that \u201cthe Republic is no more. We now live in a police state,\u201d and both our social security system and foreign policy are \u201call based on lies and ignorance.\u201d\n\nRafael Cruz is marginally cheerier: He believes we live in the end times\u2014but that there will be a great \u201cwealth transfer\u201d in the meantime, brought about by \u201ckings, anointed to take dominion\u201d in various sectors of society. After that, well, Jesus comes back, and that ends badly for a lot of people.\n\nI will stop short of my opposite numbers\u2019 insistence that the politician raised by a father of apocalyptic temperament himself intends to bring his own end to the country.\n\nBut if you think it\u2019s even possible that sitting at the knee of Frank Marshall Davis could turn Obama into the Manchurian Candidate, then shouldn\u2019t you care that in the Cruz and Rand households, the ideological indoctrination was intentional, specific, and continued long into adulthood?\n\nLegends about Obama\u2019s father figures\u2019 influence draw equally from daytime talk-show-level psychological assumptions about Obama\u2019s lack of \u201cclosure\u201d regarding his father and positively postmodern, obsessive textual analysis.\n\nOthers have debunked the specifics of each individual\u2019s overarching influence (see here, here, here); in general, the idea that Obama political ambitions are just a graft from some older generation is hard to believe because Obama has been unprecedentedly transparent about his intellectual development and his search for a father figure. He hasn\u2019t brushed off comparisons and associations, he\u2019s written whole books and given speeches to explain both what he learned from the teachers in his life, and where he split from them.\n\nThis just isn\u2019t what we\u2019ve seen from Ted Cruz and Rand Paul. Senator Cruz still talks \u201cdeep into the night\u201d with his father, and \u201cuses his father for the kind of guidance you\u2019d expect from a consultant.\u201d Senator Paul has been more deliberately distant, in pure physical terms, from his father, but some of Ron Paul\u2019s most disturbing theories peak out from the edges of Rand\u2019s carefully edited image: His invocation of Lysander Spooner, an anti-Lincoln/anti-slavery Civil War-era anarchist, during his 2013 filibuster drew excited attention from Ron Paul diehards. He\u2019s raised the theory that Christianity ought to be enough of a basis for society, without many other laws\u2014\u201c98% percent of us won\u2019t murder people, won\u2019t steal\u201d\u2014a tenet of the same Christian Reconstructionism Rafael Cruz loudly preaches and a long-observed facet of Ron Paul\u2019s worldview.\n\nAgain, the concern is not that the younger Rand and Cruz have belief systems that exactly duplicate their fathers\u2019. The issue is that their beliefs so clearly have roots in those dinner table rants.\n\nTurn the radical socialism of Davis/Ayers/Wright on its head and you get the free market fundamentalism and evangelical paranoia of both Rafael Cruz and Ron Paul. Substitute for a call to revolution against colonial powers, one against big government power. Paul\u2019s version of America-at-the-precipice is less explicitly Biblical than Cruz\u2019s belief in Christian dominionism, but the two share a theory of politics that begs for the same kind of transformative, charismatic leader to save the country from itself.\n\nAnd both fathers think their son is that leader.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:41.826+0000"}

And he wants everyone to know it.\n\nRick Perry has been slapped with many nicknames since he entered politics back in the mid-eighties, but \u201cthought leader\u201d has never been one of them.\n\nSince his epic \u201coops\u201d moment ended his 2012 presidential ambitions, Perry has seemed determined to change the perception he was just another Texan who was all swagger and no substance.\n\nAnd his efforts go beyond his hipster-approved, dark-rimmed glasses.\n\nAs the former governor\u2014who majored in animal husbandry\u2014addressed Republican activists in New Hampshire this afternoon, his comments were a curious blend of red-meat talking points and wonk name-dropping.\n\nThe audience of Granite State conservatives who listened to him over their lunches of soggy stuffed shells and green beans probably didn\u2019t include too many monetary policy enthusiasts\u2014but that didn\u2019t stop Perry. His remarks were practically footnoted with references to the academic legwork he\u2019s been doing since his ill-fated bid.\n\n\u201cI spent the last three years in that mode,\u201d he said of his study sessions.\n\nHe said he focused on, \u201cbeing able to stand up and discuss all of these issues and do it in a way that is very profound and impactful, and sitting down\u2014from the Hoover Institute to the Brookings Institute and everything in between.\u201d\n\nPerry seemed delighted to share that he\u2019d spent time \u201csitting with Richard Fisher and Jim Rickards at the same table, which was rather interesting, to talk monetary policy.\u201d\n\nRecalling the memory, he gave a knowing chuckle. Noone else in the room seemed to get the joke.\n\nApparently Fisher and Rickards\u2014the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the chief global strategist of West Shore Funds, respectively\u2014don\u2019t have particularly high name ID in New Hampshire.\n\nRick Perry seemed delighted to share that he\u2019d spent time \u201csitting with Richard Fisher and Jim Rickards at the same table, which was rather interesting, to talk monetary policy.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t matter.\n\nPerry has had a million meetings, and he wanted to share them all.\n\nPerry jumped into the presidential contest for the first time just a few months after the Texas state legislature finished its session in 2011 (those sessions only come every two years), and just one month after back surgery\u2014that turned out to have a tougher recovery time than he had expected.\n\nFrom the moment he declared in August 2011, he was the center of attention.\n\nSo when he headed to the debate stage with paltry preparation to talk about national issues, it wasn\u2019t pretty.\n\nThis time may be different. Now that he\u2019s out of the governor\u2019s mansion, Perry has the time to prepare and refine his pitch to voters.\n\nIt might not matter; the \u201coops\u201d video will be omnipresent if he becomes a top contender, and much of that damage is as irrevocable as it is amusing.\n\nStill, hitting the books seems to be paying off, at least among academics.\n\nJames Carafano, a foreign policy expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, has met with the governor and said he found him impressive.\n\n\u201cIt was really good, he was really thoughtful,\u201d Carafano said.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t like, \u2018Well I haven\u2019t heard of that,\u2019\u201d he added. \u201cIt was generally what you would hope for. I don\u2019t expect the president to be an expert on all these issues.\u201d\n\nAnd Brooke Rollins, who helms the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation and worked for Perry\u2019s administration from 2001 to 2003, said he has inundated Austin with policy experts.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s flown a lot of people in over the last couple years and spent hours upon hours and days upon days with some of the country\u2019s and really the world\u2019s best experts,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a johnny-come-lately effort,\u201d she added.\n\nAnd, per Rollins, things were very different in 2011. Perry made the decision to run for the first time with much less forethought, and he didn\u2019t do nearly the same amount of prep work.\n\n\u201cIt all happened very, very quickly,\u201d she said.\n\nSo now Perry is bending over backwards to let New Hampshire Republican primary voters know that this time, he\u2019s studied up. It might not help, as the Real Clear Politics average of 2016 Republican primary polls gives him a dinky 2.8 percent average.\n\nBut at least he\u2019s learning.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:42.081+0000"}

Why is the Obama administration trying to bury this material?\n\nScattered around the U.S. Capitol complex are a series of Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facilities, or SCIFs, which are typically used to hold Top Secret information.\n\nBut today in these deeply secure settings are a series of unclassified documents\u2014items dealing with the Iran nuclear deal that are not secret, but that the Obama administration is nevertheless blocking the public from reading.\n\nThe Obama administration delivered 18 documents to Congress on July 19, in accordance with legislation requiring a congressional review of the nuclear deal. Only one of these documents is classified, while the remaining 17 are unclassified.\n\nYet many of these unclassified documents cannot be shared with the public or discussed openly with the press. The protocol for handling these documents, set by the State Department and carried out by Congress, is that these unreleased documents can only be reviewed \u2018in camera\u2019\u2014a Latin term that means only those with special clearance can read them\u2014and must be held in various congressional SCIFs.\n\nMost staffers were hesitant to discuss\u2014let alone share\u2014a number of these documents, even though they\u2019re not classified, because they require security clearances to view. By mixing a classified document with unclassified documents, critics of this arrangement contend, important facts are being kept from the public just as Congress is deciding whether to support or oppose the Iran deal.\n\n\u201cThe unclassified items\u2026 should be public. This is going to be the most important foreign policy decision that this Congress will make,\u201d a Republican Senate aide told The Daily Beast. \u201cThis is the administration that once said it would be the most transparent administration in history. They\u2019re not acting like it.\u201d\n\n\u201cMany in Congress view the administration\u2019s tactic of co-mingling unclassified documents with classified documents and requiring congressional staffers to have secret clearances just to view certain unclassified documents as an attempt by the administration to limit open debate,\u201d a second senior Republican congressional staffer said.\n\nAmong the 17 unclassified documents are important texts related to the Iran nuclear deal: One document, titled \u201cElements of Iran\u2019s R&D Plan,\u201d is based on the \u201csafeguards confidential plan [between] Iran and the IAEA,\u201d or International Atomic Energy Agency, a State Department official said, and so it can\u2019t be released publicly. The document describes how Iran\u2019s research and development on its nuclear program, including on its centrifuges, could progress over time.\n\nOther unclassified documents may be diplomatically sensitive: One is a letter from the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the U.K. to Secretary of State John Kerry; another is a letter from Kerry to the three foreign ministers and his Chinese counterpart as well.\n\nThe set includes a discussion paper written before the final agreement, on how sanctions would be dealt with in the interim. Yet another is a draft statement by the U.S. government, to be issued on a future Iran deal implementation day.\n\nBloomberg View\u2019s Eli Lake and Josh Rogin previously reported the existence of the 18 documents submitted by the Obama administration to Congress, as well as some descriptions of what the set contained.\n\nThe Iran nuclear deal is unlike other arms control agreements \u201cbecause it\u2019s so complex and has so many moving parts,\u201d said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. \u201cIt goes into jaw-dropping detail.\u201d So it\u2019s not a complete surprise that there might be some sensitive ancillary documents to go along with the arrangement. Iran might not want the particulars of its nuclear research program in full public view, for instance.\n\nThe unreleased, unclassified documents are informative for Congress but not for public consumption, the State Department contends.\n\n\u201cSome of the documents are the types of documents which, like State Department cables and other internal USG documents, we would not post publicly but would share with Congress in appropriate circumstances. Others are documents that, while not part of the [Iran nuclear agreement] itself, pertain to it and we were clear with the other P5+1 members and Iran that we would be sharing those documents with Congress, and we have,\u201d a State Department official said.\n\nAdded the official, \u201cCongress has every document that we have, and every Member of Congress and every staff [member] with the necessary security clearance can review all of the documents.\u201d\n\nSome Democrats were supportive of the administration\u2019s hush-hush approach. The documents are part of a sensitive diplomatic process involving Iran\u2019s nuclear program, they argue, so it\u2019s not surprising that there are some restrictions to the level of transparency the government will allow.\n\n\u201cThe essential elements to make the decision on the deal are out there,\u201d a senior Democratic aide said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lack of transparency or discussion on [the Iran deal], because you\u2019ve had very detailed briefings and every member of Congress has been able to view these documents\u2026 The way they are stored is consistent and not unreasonable, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything nefarious.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the administration that once said it would be the most transparent administration in history. They\u2019re not acting like it.\u201d\n\nOpen-government advocates, on the other hand, were appalled that unclassified documents this important were being kept both from public view\u2014and, in a real way, from serious congressional scrutiny.\n\n\u201cKeeping unclassified documents in a SCIF is overkill, even if the documents are sensitive or confidential. They simply don\u2019t need the kind of sophisticated protection against clandestine surveillance that SCIFs are intended to provide,\u201d said Steven Aftergood, a senior research analyst at the Federation of American Scientists, working to reduce government secrecy.\n\n\u201cThe primary obstacle to congressional review that is created by this arrangement is the requirement to physically be present in the SCIF. Members of Congress cannot review the material in their offices, or share it with trusted colleagues or with subject matter experts. It is a significant hindrance to review,\u201d he added.\n\nCongress passed a law called the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, also known as Corker-Cardin, requiring the administration to formally submit the Iran nuclear deal, an unclassified verification assessment with any secret annexes, and other relevant materials to Congress.\n\nThe intention of that provision was for unclassified materials to be freely available so that an open debate on the public interest could occur. Members of Congress are pointing out that this is not what is happening\u2014and are urging the Obama administration to allow their release.\n\n\u201cA lot of both documents and discussion that have been held in a classified setting doesn\u2019t have classified characteristics to it\u2026 to the extent that many [documents aren\u2019t classified,] they should be made totally public, as far as I\u2019m concerned, so that the public can evaluate for themselves,\u201d Democratic Senator Bob Menendez told The Daily Beast.\n\nRepublican Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, agrees. His spokesperson told The Daily Beast that Corker \u201cbelieves that the administration should make these unclassified documents available to the public so the American people can see the details of the Iran nuclear deal.\u201d\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Alexa Corse and Noah Shachtman", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:42.361+0000"}
{"entityId": 1973, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "He\u2019s out there whacking away at Hillary, and he\u2019s right. But the Texas Senator has got some disclosure issues of his own to fess up to.\n\nLast week, would-be Republican presidential nominee Ted Cruz tore in to Hillary Clinton for having sacrificed America\u2019s national security while the Clinton Foundation was reportedly benefiting from millions in foreign largesse. Yet, Cruz\u2019s stridency belies the fact that Cruz has his own foreign money and transparency problems, and that his campaign has refused to respond to inquiries from The Daily Beast about his business dealings. Like the Bonnie and Clyde of Little Rock, it appears that Cruz too has a penchant for crony capitalism and foreign money, and a disdain for disclosure.\n\nUnderstandably, Cruz has no interest about talking about his own brushes with the Senate Select Committee on Ethics, his own spotty financial, his ties to Caribbean Equity Partners Limited, a Caribbean investment vehicle, or to CEP\u2019s principal, David Panton. You see, as a Senate candidate in 2012, Cruz was required by law to come clean publicly about his holdings and finances\u2014except that, according to a report in Time magazine, he didn\u2019t, or at least not immediately\u2014that is, not until Time forced Cruz\u2019s hand.\n\nFor the record, Cruz did not initially own up to the fact that CEP owed him money, and then further messed up by failing to make a complete disclosure about CEP\u2019s indebtedness, according to Time\u2019s review of Cruz\u2019s congressional filings. Indeed, in an October 21, 2013 letter to the Secretary of the Senate, Cruz acknowledged that his 2012 financial disclosures \u201cinadvertently omitted certain financial information.\u201d (PDF)\n\nBut for Cruz, all that is just so yesterday. Panton, who was Cruz\u2019s best man at his wedding, is now a driving force of a Cruz super-PAC, named Stand for Principle. Panton described his relationship with Cruz this way to the Jamaica Observer: \u201cI speak with and see Ted frequently as a close friend, but deliberately do not discuss his campaign strategy.\u201d Panton added, \u201cAs an active supporter of a super-Pac that supports him, I am not able to discuss campaign strategy with him.\u201d\n\nAll this would be interesting enough, except for the fact that Panton is the son of the late Keith Panton, a Jamaican cabinet officer who was also the former head of Alcan Jamaica. And it gets even better. David Panton was a member of the Jamaican Senate until he resigned in 2004 to pursue a career in finance in the United States, and the Panton family was tight with Jamaica\u2019s former Prime Minister, Edward Seaga, and with the Jamaican Labor Party, which had its own issues and ties to drugs and violence. Traditional family values, indeed.\n\nSo how did Cruz come to know the Pantons, what exactly was CEP, and how much did Cruz actually profit? Cruz first met David Panton at Princeton, where the pair were roommates and members of the school\u2019s debating team. As Panton told The Daily Beast two years ago, \u201cUnlike what others may say, I consider Ted to be very kind. He is a very, very gentle-hearted person \u2026 He took me under his wing and was a mentor to me. He was very kind to me. I am a much smarter and much better person today because of Ted Cruz.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Cruz, a dual- national until he got called-out, sees no parallel to Hillary when he looks into the mirror.\n\nThe two would then move on to Harvard Law School, where Panton would be the second African American to be elected president of the Harvard Law Review. Like Cruz\u2019s father, Panton\u2019s father was also a minister, albeit in the Anglican Church.\n\nAs for CEP, it was established in 1998, and Cruz was one of CEP\u2019s founding directors and shareholders, according to Time. Cruz had invested $6,000 in CEP, but watched that sum grow to $100,000 when he cashed out in November 2002 (PDF). For his troubles, Cruz received $25,000 up front, and a $75,000 IOU from Panton\u2019s firm, CEP Investments Holdings Limited, Kingston, Jamaica, which is presently valued by Cruz to be worth between $100,000 and $250,000 (PDF), once a \u201creasonable rate of interest\u201d is factored in to the equation (PDF), according to Cruz\u2019s congressional financial disclosures, made available at the Open Secrets web site.\n\nStill, for his part, Cruz would like the world to believe that CEP was just another private equity fund. Except CEP wasn\u2019t any old private equity fund. Heck, to the untrained eye, CEP looks awfully like Hillary Clinton\u2019s old cattle futures investment, where she parlayed $1,000 into $99,540, courtesy of James Blair, a Clinton crony and the top lawyer of Arkansas-based Tysons Foods, America\u2019s largest poultry company.\n\nHere\u2019s what I mean. CEP seemed to be about as crony-capitalist an arrangement as it could get. For all intents and purposes, CEP could have been called Jamaica\u2019s version of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. CEP managed an investment fund established by the Jamaican government, which received investment backing from the Caribbean Development Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, according to The Gleaner, a Jamaican newspaper.\n\nAlso according to The Gleaner, in 2000 CEP and \u201cCaribbean Basin Investors Limited (CBIL) \u2026 recently formed the Caribbean Investment Fund to make investments in the 14 member countries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \u2026 Caribbean Equity Partners will manage the Fund on behalf of CBIL and the Fund\u2019s investors.\u201d Oh, and while CEP was doing its thing in the Caribbean, Cruz was working on the 2000 Bush campaign, and would be rewarded for his troubles with appointments at the Department of Justice as Associate Deputy Attorney General, and then at the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nTo be clear, there was nothing illegal about CEP managing the fund. But for Cruz, who was a Bush political appointee at DOJ and the FTC, to simultaneously hold an interest in an offshore semi-sovereign investment vehicle raises questions, especially when he was there at the fund\u2019s genesis. Indeed, when Cruz\u2019s wife, Heidi Nelson Cruz, joined Treasury, both she and Cruz were forced to offload their holdings because they could have given rise to a conflict of interest, and CEP was one of those holdings, according to Time.\n\nWhether Cruz is proud of profiting from a crony capitalist venture is not known, as his campaign has declined to comment to The Daily Beast. But one thing\u2019s for sure, he despises it in others, or at least when the game is played north of Jamaica. At CPAC 2014 Cruz announced, \u201cWashington is corrupt. There is a corrupt and inter-locking system of lobbyists and lawyers and consultants that are suckling off Washington \u2026 We need to end the corruption. We need to end corporate welfare and crony capitalism.\u201d\n\nThen just last week, Cruz told Breitbart, \u201cHillary Clinton embodies the culture of corruption in Washington, where politicians enrich themselves and expand their own power\u2014Washington only gets more and more powerful\u2014and the lives of hardworking Americans get harder and harder and harder. Of course, Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation should return the money they received from foreign nations particularly when she was Secretary of State.\u201d\n\nCruz is spot-on when he takes Clinton to task.

Trump claimed the story \u201cvirtually torpedoed\u201d his dreams, according to the Associated Press, by depicting his would-be tower as \u201can atrocious, ugly monstrosity\u201d even though, Trump said, he hadn\u2019t even yet hired an architect or drawn a plan.\n\nTrump threatened to sue ABC in 2005, after he learned the network was planning to produce a two-hour biopic about him and his family.

Trump now claims he\u2019s worth \u201c$8,737,540,000.\u201d\n\nPlaces Donald Trump Has Sued\n\nIn 1989, Trump threatened to sue Palm Beach County if it couldn\u2019t figure out a way to muffle the loud noises coming from Palm Beach International Airport.\n\nTrump sued New York State in 1995 when a video game, Quickdraw, based off the casino game Keno, was introduced in New York restaurants and bars. The game presented a rival to Trump\u2019s Atlantic City casinos where Keno was played, but he claimed he was really just worried that the game\u2019s presence in New York would bring \u201ctremendous amounts of crime\u201d and \u201cdestroy businesses in New York,\u201d according to CNN, because gambling addiction would render residents unable to pay their rent.\n\nIn 1997, Trump sued the state of New Jersey. At the time, Trump wanted to prevent Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn from encroaching on his Atlantic City territory with the construction of a $330 million tunnel leading to Wynn\u2019s very own resort. Trump filed suit against the state, claiming it was illegal for New Jersey to aid Wynn\u2019s tunnel project in any way with money it collected from casinos. The Star-Ledger reported Trump claimed that if the state used casino funds to support the tunnel, it would be \u201ctaking money from widows and orphans,\u201d the elderly, and people with disabilities.\n\nIn 2002, Trump sued New York City for $500 million, claiming that a tax assessor scandal had forced him to sell apartment in his 72-story Trump World Tower near the United Nations for below market prices.\n\nTrump sued the town of Palm Beach, Florida. in 2006 for $10 million after he was cited for violating zoning codes by flying a too-big (for non-patriots) American flag over his club, Mar-a-Lago. The lawsuit claimed \u201ca smaller flag and pole on Mar-a-Lago\u2019s property would be lost given its massive size, look silly instead of make a statement, and most importantly would fail to appropriately express the magnitude of Donald J. Trump\u2019s and the Club\u2019s members\u2019 patriotism,\u201d according to the Associated Press. Trump promised any damages awarded to him would be donated to Iraq war veterans. In 2007, Trump and the town settled. The Tampa Bay Times reported the town dropped the fines, and Trump donated $100,000 \u201cto various charities for veterans of the war in Iraq, the American flag or veterans\u2019 hospitals.\u201d\n\nIn 2011, Trump sued Scotland. Trump claimed the government had assured him a planned offshore wind farm would never actually be constructed, and so he built a golf course and made plans for a neighboring hotel. When the wind farm was built, Trump sued the government. He ultimately lost.\n\nBusinesses Donald Trump Has Sued\n\nTrump purchased Eastern Air Lines\u2019s shuttle service in 1988 for $365 million and planned to relaunch it as \u201cTrump Shuttle.\u201d But a problem arose\u2014a different company, Trading and Finance Corp. Ltd., was already using the name. In 1989, Trump sued for the rights to the name.\n\nIn 2008, Trump sued Crescent Heights Diamond, a real estate developer, because, Trump said, they had licensed his name for a 70-story building in Ramat Gan, near Tel Aviv, and then cut him out of the profits.\n\nIn 2011, Trump sued H. Pixel International Trade Ltd., an Israeli company he discovered was using his name and likeness on vodka bottles without his consent. Trump has over 700 trademarks and as of 2011, his name was commercially protected in 80 countries.\n\nIn 2014, Trump sued Trump Entertainment Resorts, which he holds a 10 percent stake in, to remove his name from the Trump Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza casinos in Atlantic City, which he said did not live up to his standard of quality.\n\nMisc.\n\nIn 2003, Trump announced that he planned to sue the Eastern Pequots, a Native American tribe of less than 1,000 from southeastern Connecticut. Trump claimed he had spent close to $10 million helping to promote the tribe\u2019s brand in exchange for the right to negotiate the tribe\u2019s casino agreements. Ultimately, the tribe selected a different developer to handle their deal, which was the source of Trump\u2019s ire.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:42.793+0000"}

He\u2019s \u201ca barking carnival act\u201d and \u201cbloviating Godzilla,\u201d He\u2019s \u201ca Mobius strip seamlessly moving from perception to reality,\u201d \u201cthe world\u2019s greatest troll\u201d and a \u201csuperhero \u2013 but not in a good way.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe is a \u201cloose-haired agent of chaos,\u201d with \u201cthe complexion of a creamsicle,\u201d whose \u201chair swirls atop his head with disconcerting translucence \u2014 a cotton candy sculpture in the shape of a vending machine honey bun.\u201d Trump\u2019s \u201csuits have a cut and sheen as if they came from the trunk sale of a visiting Bombay tailor staying in a cheap hotel in Trump\u2019s native Queens and taking a nip between fittings.\u201d\n\n\n\nHis stage presence is the result of \u201cmethod acting that eventually supplanted whatever human-like personality he once possessed.\u201d He is a \u201cfat-haired yapping caricature of capitalism\u201d currently \u201cyelling crazy shit on his way through a Republican presidential primary while sporting a sad trombone haircut\u201d as he serves up \u201ca smelly soup of billionaire populism and yahoo nationalism\u2014all flavored with a tangy dollop of old-timey racism.\u201d\n\nBut wade through the purple prose and you will bark your shins on the same few points again and again. Almost all of Trump\u2019s exhaustive coverage\u2014both reporting and analysis\u2014falls into a few categories.\n\nThe day-to-day coverage, the part of campaign reporting that for most candidates is made up of \u201cwent to this place, did this thing\u201d facts, has its own consistent Trumpian rhythm: 1) Outrageous thing said or done. 2) Quotes from strategists about whether this will be it! 3) Nope!\n\n(All three steps can probably be summed up as a collective \u201cWelp!\u201d)\n\nWhen it comes to explaining his appeal, to figuring out what this improbable, sustained performance can mean, even our most thoughtful pundits scrabble after the same few tired tropes.\n\nLiberals argue he\u2019s the logical result of the GOP\u2019s rightward trajectory, the inevitable end-game of Angry White Guy Bingo (Place a chip on the square marked \u201cimmigrants!,\u201d etc.).\n\nSome aim wider and proclaim that pervasive disillusionment explains the Trump phenomenon. He\u2019s a vote against a corrupt system, for rebellion, \u201che\u2019s the ultimate anti-politician.\u201d (My own contribution fell in this genre, ticking off supporters\u2019 \u201czero-sum mentality and vengeful nihilism.\u201d) Particularly confounded conservatives try to rescue some dignity when they use him as an indictment of politics as a whole. Voters are responding to his authenticity, because, obviously, the billionaire \u201ccarries himself like an up-from-the-streets, never back down guy, who despises the elites as much as they hate him.\u201d It\u2019s the realnesss, not the racism! Though sentences such as, \u201cIt is precisely because people have lost their awe for the presidency that they imagine Mr. Trump as a viable president\u201d do imply it\u2019s all Barry O\u2019Bummer\u2019s fault.\n\nOthers ascribe the appeal of this \u201cplutocratic populist from hell\u201d to aspirational, greedhead brashness, Gordon Gecko without the suspenders, \u201cGlengarry Glen Ross\u201d but everyone gets steak knives. He symbolizes wealth, and \u201chow ardently certain blowhards pursue it, how much the rest of us forgive in those who attain it, how thoroughly we equate money and accomplishment.\u201d He\u2019s perfected hip-hop\u2019s \u201cun-ironic American self-homage,\u201d and, \u201cIf elected, he\u2019s less likely to represent George W. Bush\u2019s third term than Kanye West\u2019s first one.\u201d\n\nTrue cynics blame his rise on country as a whole, our political-entertainment-industrial complex that gives celebrity importance and trivializes true civic engagement. It\u2019s not a campaign; \u201cIt\u2019s great programming.\u201d\n\nIndeed, these Trump Tropes are so rote that some journalists don\u2019t feel the need to do actual reporting on the Trump phenomenon: They just gather up some New Hampshire-ites and prompt them to recite variations on the themes.\n\nMy own, hitherto private convictions about What Trump Means have swung between the suspicion that American voters are in some way in on the joke (come October he\u2019ll pull off the rubber mask and reveal he\u2019s been Stephen Colbert all along) and paranoia that whatever social progress we\u2019ve made has, in fact, called down the wrath of Someone\u2014it can\u2019t be the God I\u2019m familiar with\u2014and Trump is our punishment. I mean, I believe gay marriage was worth it and everything but, geez. I have also considered the possibility that we are living in a science fiction dystopia. (To be sure, Thursday\u2019s debate looks to be a combination of a Dark Mirror episode and the Red Wedding.)\n\nThe only thing that\u2019s really changed in media\u2019s month-long experiment in extended irony is the tone. It\u2019s gone from reassuring dismissiveness to simmering dread, as writers find themselves having to hedge around the once-authoritative pronouncement of his ever-approaching demise. \u201cThe smart money's been on a bit of a losing streak,\u201d admitted the Washington Post. And, in USA Today: \u201cHispanics for Trump? Oh yeah. Get ready. That\u2019s a thing.\u201d Pollster Charlie Cook squeezes in a qualifier \u2013 \u201cTrump's candidacy is almost certainly destined to fail\u201d \u2013 as 52 percent of Republicans say they want him to stay in.\n\nI have told myself that this trepidation I feel is about the fate of the country, it stems from my concern over what kind of policy insanity could come from an actual Trump administration (with VP Mark Cuban and Secretary of State Sarah Palin, the production, and moral, values would seem to be less Game of Thrones and more Sharknado).\n\nBut I wonder if my unease\u2014an apprehension I seem to share with many of my colleagues\u2014is not about what might happen to the country, but what is in the process of happening, right now, to us in the media.\n\nJonah Goldberg, wading around in the pop-cultural tide pool for a Trump analog, likened him to the faux-bumpkin Machiavelli from \u201cA Face in the Crowd,\u201d Lonesome Rhodes. Goldberg deserves points for taste and proximity: The film\u2019s tale of a talk-show radio host whose \u201cplain talk\u201d for \u201creal folks\u201d hides authoritarian, plutocratic ambitions certainly fits the general shape of the GOP\u2019s last twenty years. In the movie, he falls from grace when a live microphone broadcasts his scheming;\n\nBut Rhodes today is better represented by Rush or Rove; most of the Republican party\u2019s elected officials are the bought-and-paid-for genial suits that Rhodes controlled from behind the scenes. Trump is something else entirely, neither Rove nor Rush nor Rhodes nor complacent Koch-brother placeholder. Certainly, Trump could not fall prey to the same accidental exposure of unseemly opinions and plans that unraveled Rhodes (or Mitt Romney): Trump\u2019s hypocrisy and offensiveness are on constant public display.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if pop culture can offer the exact right avatar for Trump\u2014but A Face in the Crowd is still instructive, we just need to cast it differently. Lonesome Rhodes isn\u2019t Trump, he\u2019s us, he\u2019s me\u2014he\u2019s the media in general.\n\nThe richness of our language about Trump as a man exposes the poverty of our analysis of him as a phenomenon. His refusal to go away exposes the superfluousness of our predictions. The churn of \u201cTrump takes\u201d is a real-time erosion of confidence in our ability to provide the only real service punditry provides: to make sense of what\u2019s happening. His survival has shown how ephemeral narratives can be, and how permanent biases are. Our failure to adequately explain Trump, to tame him, reveals machinations and mistakes that usually go unnoticed. The Trump candidacy is the media\u2019s ongoing hot mic moment.

Yes, there are always the rehearsed soundbites and bitter sideswipes, but a healthy portion of debates is always about policy\u2014you know, what presidents actually do with their power in office.\n\nNo one\u2019s expecting the Lincoln-Douglas debates to suddenly break out this Thursday. But Donald Trump has so dumbed down the political conversation this year that he\u2019s got other candidates wondering whether they should bother formulating policies. Because the shtick that\u2019s elevated the rusty combover to the top of the polls is hilarious stuff if you dig insult comedy aimed at the American electorate.\n\nTalking health care last week, the onetime supporter of single-payer told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that he would \u201cRepeal [Obamacare] and replace it with something terrific.\u201d When pressed about this \u201csomething terrific,\u201d Trump patiently explained: \u201cWe are going to have to work out some kind of a very, very smart deal with hospitals around the country.\u201d\n\nOn immigration, the demagogic heart of his campaign, The Donald assured Bash that \u201cI have been giving it so much thought,\u201d building on his promise to have Mexico pay for a wall across the Southern border by engaging in a mass deportation to \u201cget the bad ones out.\u201d When pressed on just how he\u2019d accomplish this, Trump patiently explained: \u201cPoliticians are not going to find them, because they have no clue. We will find them. We will get them out.\u201d\n\nAll this makes Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201csecret plan to win the war\u201d during Vietnam look like a model of clarity and foresight. And so it\u2019s no wonder that demagoguery is beating details on this campaign to date.\n\nBut there are notable, heartening exceptions, and those brave souls refusing simply to play to the lowest common denominator deserve a shout-out for making an effort.\n\nEven before kicking off a campaign, Chris Christie issued a plan to reduce the growth of entitlement spending by $1 trillion over 10 years through means-testing Social Security and raising the retirement age. These are the kinds of bold fiscal conservative proposals that used to unite the GOP until polls showed the Tea Party didn\u2019t want the government to touch Medicare.\n\nJeb Bush is still learning how to light up a crowd, but the former Florida governor is a true policy wonk who has courageously continued to back education reform and immigration reform despite overheated disapproval from the conservative populist base.\n\nBut the surprise award for GOP policy substance goes to the freshman libertarian Senator Rand Paul. Rather than simply ducking out of his elected duties to run for president, Paul has used his office to advance controversial policies. These include backing bipartisan proposals that push forward debates ranging from criminal justice reform to NSA reform, taking on mandatory drug minimum sentencing and restoring felony voting rights\u2014not exactly policies that are high on the priority list of Republican primary voters.\n\nYou\u2019d have to jump over to the other side of the aisle to see the most substantive policy-based campaign to date.\n\nBut Paul also has proposed the most detailed tax reform plan of any conservative candidate to date, pushing a 14.5 percent flat tax while eliminating most deductions and the regressive payroll tax. The plan might be politically implausible and even unwise, but it ain\u2019t painted with pastel colors. I only wish he\u2019d extend the same bold thinking to backing the obvious libertarian position of supporting the freedom to marry rather than trying to tiptoe around the issue for fear of offending traditionalists who aren\u2019t going to vote for him anyway.\n\nBut you\u2019d have to jump over to the other side of the aisle to see the most substantive policy-based campaign to date.\n\nTraditionally, front-runners play it safe for fear of losing their lead. That usually means putting forward as little specific policy as possible. But over the past few weeks, Hillary Clinton has trotted out detailed proposals on issues ranging from the economy to energy and the environment, calling for quadruple the amount of electricity generated by renewables by the end of the next decade. She didn\u2019t flinch or think of Florida when backing an end to the Cuba embargo, and while championing decisions like the war in Libya will bring deserved increased scrutiny, she\u2019s got a detailed record as secretary of state to add real ballast to the typical campaign bluster.\n\nThe economy is issue No. 1 in all the polls, and Clinton\u2019s uncommonly thoughtful speech on the problems that come from \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d deserves more discussion.\n\nSpeaking at NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business, Clinton offered a wide-ranging series of prescriptions aimed at adjusting the perverse incentives that too often force our country and corporations to think about short-term tactics rather than long-term strategy, rampant speculation rather than long-term investment. This is proving to be the Achilles\u2019 heel of liberal capitalist democracy, which she rightly called \u201cthe greatest engine of economic opportunity and potential that has ever been invented.\u201d\n\nThe core of her proposals include a sliding scale that would reduce the capital gains tax rate for investments held over six years while eliminating cap gains for long-term investments in startups and small businesses, especially in distressed areas. She would make the Research and Experimentation tax credit permanent while ending tax-break subsidies to established industries like oil and gas, and close the carried interest loophole for hedge funds. She would encourage profit-sharing across corporations while reining in activist shareholders and executive pay-packages that incentivize short-term gains rather than long-term growth.\n\nThere\u2019s plenty to quibble with in Clinton\u2019s specifics. For one, she addresses the 3.8 percent Affordable Care Act tax only in a footnote, meaning that all her rates are higher than advertised. Second, she would have been well-advised to cut long-term capital gains rates\u2014for example, those investments held over 10 years\u2014in half to really make a clear, bold point about rewarding investment.\n\nBut her broad argument for the proper role of government still stands\u2014smart regulation creates incentives toward societally beneficial behavior. This is at the heart of what Cass Sunstein has called \u201clibertarian paternalism,\u201d and there\u2019s an urgency behind these sorts of reforms right now.\n\nEspecially in an era of high-frequency trading, there is a fundamental sense that the game is rigged against responsible long-term value investors in favor of short-term speculators\u2014and that undercuts trust in our system of government and economics while the middle class gets squeezed for yet another decade. In the larger sense, America and its liberal capitalist democratic allies are facing a critical challenge from \u201cMarket Leninist\u201d countries like China and Russia, which are trying to push an alternative international system based in large part around the idea that democracies are decadent, inefficient, and unpredictable when it comes to long-term planning.\n\nAmid the polarization of our two parties, responsible policy specifics carry risks from the base as well as the opposition. Clinton is walking a difficult line at a time when Democrats are wrestling with the increased influence of a left-wing Tea Party. And while her proposals to rein in the excesses of \u201cquarterly capitalism\u201d drew cheers from centrist organizations like Third Way, their very support provoked a Pavlovian response on the part of progressive activists like Democracy for America. Executive Director Charles Chamberlain finger-wagged at Clinton for not \u201caggressively taking on the powerful, greed-driven institutions that have dominated the Democratic Party and held back the prosperity of the American people for too long.\u201d In the face of such a response, the Clinton folks could be forgiven for thinking that no good deed goes unpunished. But the Berniacs already have their candidate, and he\u2019s not in any danger of winning a general election any time soon.\n\nOne reflection of the rampant short-term thinking in our culture is the reluctance of most presidential candidates to wade into the deep waters of policy. Yes, there are political risks, but it\u2019s a dangerous world. And the blustery idiot wind of bumper-sticker politics is insufficient for the office they want to occupy.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:43.116+0000"}

Here comes first gentleman Bill Clinton.\n\nFinally! \u201cMadame President Hillary Rodham Clinton cordially invites you to The White House\u201d\u2014this is what the Hillary camp with today\u2019s launch of her campaign envisions. A Hillary Clinton presidency will shatter the glass ceiling so many of our grandmothers, mothers, sisters and friends have hit. But if the former First Lady, two-term New York senator and secretary of state takes her experience inside government and on the campaign trail all the way to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, she won\u2019t be the only Clinton to break new ground.\n\nIf Hillary Clinton wins, it will be a surprise if the First Gentleman and former President William Jefferson Clinton sets a fashion trend or spends his time playing host, picking out china patterns, or reviewing state dinner menus. The co-presidency pitched in 1992 may finally arrive, but with her at the helm, not him. Now they both could hold the honors of being our nation\u2019s president and first spouse. They both will have had each other\u2019s jobs. How about the advice they can give each other? Imagine the briefing on Inauguration Day. Think about the White House operator who gets a call for President Clinton and has to sheepishly ask, \u201cWhich one? Current or former?\u201d\n\nThe Office of the First Lady began as a uniquely American institution. The term was initially used to describe the \u201cfirst\u201d lady, Martha Washington. Following Lady Washington, first spouses chose titles at their discretion, but the coinage only really caught on after a 1911 play about Dolley Madison titled The First Lady in the Land. By the 1930s it had become the norm.\n\nThe role of the first lady has continually been transformed. Madison elevated the station though her dedication to orphans and women. She risked her life to protect American artifacts as the War of 1812 left Washington burning. Edith Wilson\u2019s detractors called her \u201cPresidentress\u201d after her husband, President Woodrow Wilson, suffered a stroke and she took over her husband\u2019s schedule.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt, an admired model for Secretary Clinton, transformed the office as a popular columnist, radio show host, U.N. Commission for Human Rights chairwoman, and public proxy for her paralyzed husband.\n\nAll of the ladies who followed in Ambassador Roosevelt\u2019s wake chose a cause and tweaked the role, including becoming a prominent presence on the campaign trail.\n\nThe Kennedys credited Lady Bird Johnson with winning them the Lone Star State. Jackie Kennedy, a reluctant icon whose beauty was unparalleled, set fashion trends that persist today. (\u201cMadmen,\u201d pillbox hat, Chanel suits, anyone?) Nancy Reagan had her \u201cJust Say No [to drugs]\u201d campaign, and both Barbara and Laura Bush championed literacy. Michelle Obama, a lawyer with degrees from Harvard Law and Princeton, has been lauded for her support of military families and programs against childhood obesity.\n\nThe Clintons will do what they do best. Re-invent. Change.\n\nSince Eleanor Roosevelt, no other first lady has transformed the office more than Hillary Rodham Clinton, who turned it into a persevering power pantsuit of policy. Though she had her critics\u2014especially from the Gingrich Republican-led Congress\u2014she overcame their jabs and from her East Wing office launched a successful New York Senate campaign. This led to her becoming a serious contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 and then secretary of state.\n\nHer husband, by virtue of being a popular former president, stands to change the Office of First Lady even more. First, there will be a new title, in addition to the presidential prefix held for life. Who will former President Clinton model his own time as the \u201cFirst Spouse/Gentleman\u201d? Washington, Madison, Wilson, Roosevelt, Lady Bird, Jackie, Nancy, Michelle, or his own wife, Hillary? Maybe a combination of all of them? Or what about other \u201cfirst dudes\u201d around the world? Maybe there\u2019s a model for the mega power couple there?\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel is arguably the most powerful woman in the world. Her husband, Joachim Sauer, is a reclusive quantum theoretical chemistry professor, who watched his wife\u2019s inauguration from \u201ca TV in the lab.\u201d Smart but not exactly someone Bill could emulate or relate to, though he did a brief stint as a professor at the University of Arkansas way back.\n\nAustralia elected Julia Gillard their 27th prime minister. Her partner, Tim Mathieson, was a hair salon owner and took on an unpaid role with charities. Got himself grilled for recommending a certain sized woman for a prostrate exam. Can\u2019t really see Bill doing an everyday job or discussing medical procedures. Also the Office of the First Lady has its own paid staff. So no help from down under.\n\nMaybe Argentina? It has a woman president and\u2014get this\u2014her husband was president before her. Right before her. Cristina Kirchner was married to N\u00e9stor Kirchner before his death in 2010. N\u00e9stor served as president from 2003 to 2007, and before that, he was a governor. Sounds familiar. Then he became Argentina\u2019s first gentleman when Cristina was elected in 2007. She was re-elected in 2011. High notes of former President N\u00e9stor Kirchner\u2019s time as first gentlemen include being elected national deputy for Buenos Aires Province, negotiating to release hostages, participating in a government conflict with the agricultural sector, and serving as secretary general of the Union of South American Nations representing the entire continent. Now that\u2019s more like it. Of course, he was a Peronist (dictatorial, polarizing, unpopular) who became friends with Hugo Chavez. OK, maybe not so much a model.\n\nSo, the Clintons will do what they do best. Re-invent. Change. The Office of the First Lady/First Gentleman will be changed forever. No one can argue the presidency isn\u2019t a hard, busy job. Why not get some help from your mate? Especially if your partner happens to be a popular former president with what has been called one of the best political minds around.\n\nWith Bill back in the White House, if not the Oval Office, the country may see a first gentleman at the direction of Madame President advising on domestic and foreign policy, barnstorming key districts after the State of the Union, quelling Middle East diplomatic tensions and mediating on behalf of various party agendas. He could do this while stopping by his alma mater, Georgetown, to give a lecture or two while continuing to work on his family\u2019s foundation.\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely future first spouses, following in the pioneering shoes of the former president, would not be given the same liberty as Bill to blaze their own paths\u2014and may God help any conservative relic who argues otherwise. President Bill Clinton may be the most interesting, powerful person to occupy the Office of the First, er, Lady since, well, Hillary Clinton. And he might be the best thing to ever happen to the office.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:43.256+0000"}

(This is not to suggest many Southerners fit this description. There are many things about the South I love. But this is a stereotype.)\n\nThe injection of Southerners into the Republican coalition\u2014a coalition they ultimately came to dominate\u2014couldn\u2019t help but change the image of the GOP. There were racial, cultural, political, and even religious implications. Republicans captured the South, yes, but the South also captured the GOP.

But it also guaranteed we would eventually see a day of reckoning.\n\nFirst, though, some background. You\u2019ve probably heard of The Southern Strategy, but might not know exactly what it means, or how the Republican Party allegedly employed it. The Southern Strategy, As Mike Allen defined it in the Washington Post, \u201cdescribed Republican efforts to use race as a wedge issue\u2014on matters such as desegregation and busing\u2014to appeal to white southern voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe electorate is rapidly becoming less white, less rural, and better educated. Yet the GOP is still culturally synonymous with, well, white, rural, less-educated southern whites, who remain a major pillar of the party\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nWhether or not you accept that this was an intentional strategy, or just how things shook out, this much is true: Around 1964, the once reliably Democratic South started to become a Republican stronghold. We may differ about what this means, and about whether the GOP deserves culpability for stirring up racial animus in order to achieve it. (As Sean Trende notes, the trend actually began in the 1920s, and that long before civil rights became a hot-button political issue, \u201cFDR performed worse in the South in every election following his 1932 election.\u201d)\n\nIn one of the chapters, Too Dumb to Fail details the many ways the so-called Southern Strategy impacted conservative policy\u2014but the impact it had in terms of cultural signaling is among the most important, if more superficial, effects.\n\n(And here I\u2019m not talking about overt racism, which I think we all condemn, but instead subtle cultural customs and signals that may seem out of touch in an America that is increasingly cosmopolitan.)\n\nLet\u2019s take George W. Bush, the most successful Republican politician of the post-Southern Strategy, post-Reagan era. After losing a congressional race, George W. Bush (possibly as a reference to a much worse George Wallace line?) vowed \u201cnever to get out-countried again.\u201d This was smart politics for Bush, who ultimately went on to become President of the United States, but it helped reinforce the image of a Republican as someone who, well, looks and talks like George W. Bush. (I realize that Texas is often considered more Western than part of the \u201cDeep South,\u201d but you get my point.)\n\nThis brings us to today. As we all know, the demographics of the country are changing rapidly. The electorate is rapidly becoming less white, less rural, and better educated. Yet the GOP is still culturally synonymous with, well, white, rural, less-educated Southern whites, who remain a major pillar of the party\u2019s support. And so you get to the point where guys like Scott Walker and Rand Paul spend a week ducking questions about whether the Confederate flag should be flown on government property\u2026in 2015.\n\nSo here\u2019s what the GOP has to figure it out: How do they continue to get the Bubba vote while shedding appeals to the cultural symbolism of the past? How do they sell their conservative ideas about free markets, strong national defense, and conservative family values to 21st-century Americans?\n\nThe seeds of this challenge were partly planted when the GOP became the de facto party of the South\u2014with all the good and bad that that entails. And now the chickens have come to roost. As you watch Republicans scramble to address the changing political landscape\u2014some more nimbly than others\u2014keep in mind this is the backdrop.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:43.414+0000"}
{"entityId": 1979, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "My new book looks at the raw truths of Southern history, but my family has been living that complicated heritage for generations.\n\nThe great Atlanta newspaperman Ralph McGill, writing in the tumultuous 1950s and 1960s, used to say \u201cthere are many Souths,\u201d and in my family, I might say, there are many Southerners, none of them quite the same.\n\nThey are a baffling and occasionally shameful array of people whose motives and attitudes are impossible to compress into any one category. In the old days they were Confederates and Unionists (one great-great-grand-uncle in the hills of North Georgia was named William Tecumseh Sherman Dickey). They were slave owners and dirt farmers, a gandy-dancer on the railroad, and a wealthy snake-oil salesman (with a sure cure for syphilis!). More recently, there was a modern-day Civil War ordnance expert, my uncle; and the poet-novelist author of Deliverance, my father, who, as it happens, also played the genteel \u201credneck\u201d sheriff in the movie.\n\nAs a result, the half-remembered and sometimes wholly fictional histories of the War Between the States that I grew up hearing were a jumble of contradictions that I only began, truly, to sort out in recent years. And my book published today, Our Man in Charleston: Britain\u2019s Secret Agent in the Civil War South, is part of that exploration.\n\nBased on years of research, it takes a close look at the self-destructive Confederate madness in the epicenter of secession through the eyes of a relatively impartial observer, Her Majesty Queen Victoria\u2019s consul in South Carolina, Robert Bunch, who reported to the Crown in bitter, cynical detail on the way the slave-owning elite inspired and led hundreds of thousands of people to their deaths in defense of an indefensible institution.\n\nThere is nothing complicated about racism, I realized. All that is complicated is the way excuses are made for it in the North as well as the South.\n\nThe more I have learned over the years about my own family, meanwhile, the more I have come to appreciate the diversity as well as the perversity of a very Southern heritage.\n\nThe defusing of a 100-pound shell in my uncle\u2019s basement with a sponge, a screwdriver, and a hammer is unforgettable for reasons I hadn\u2019t originally intended.\n\nFamily lore had it that my father\u2019s mother\u2019s father, a Rebel colonel, I was told, raised a defiant Confederate flag of some sort over one of the surviving buildings in Atlanta after the Federals burned the city. He went on to make a fortune selling a supposed cure for venereal disease, which he happily peddled to people of every race. On my father\u2019s father\u2019s side, the towering figure in the family was Hannah Dickey, one of the few slave owners in the hills of Fannin County, Georgia. She is buried on Hogback Mountain in the same plot with several of the people she owned. Yet she was not a Confederate; she was a Unionist, who named one of her many sons William Tecumseh Sherman Dickey after the Union general who cut a swath of flames and destruction through Georgia to the sea. My mother\u2019s family was from west Tennessee, the Confederate part of the state, and in the 1970s I read a report that the bodies of two Union soldiers had been found in the old family house during a remodeling.\n\nBut the most vivid of my Civil War \u201cmemories\u201d are associated with my late uncle, Tom Dickey, who was not crazy, really, but who certainly was passionate about the Civil War. Or rather, he was passionate about its guns and bullets and cannonballs and shells. Nobody in the world knew more about Confederate and Federal artillery projectiles than Tom, because from the 1950s to the 1980s he went all over obscure battlefields every chance he got, from suburban Atlanta to South Carolina swamps and Louisiana backwaters, searching with a World War II mine detector for the long-buried armaments that men had used to slaughter each other in the War Between the States.\n\nMy father, James Dickey, the poet and novelist, found it fascinating that his brother tried to \u201center the past through its munitions,\u201d and wrote a moving poem called \u201cHunting Civil War Relics at Nimblewill Creek,\u201d about searching with Tom through a forgotten killing field and watching the battle, in a sense, by watching Tom\u2019s expression as the pulse of the mine detector told him what lay beneath the surface: \u201cThe dead have waited here a hundred years to create only the look on the face of my one brother, who stands among them, offering a metal dish afloat in the trembling weeds.\u201d\n\nWhen I was a kid making documentary films in the 1970s, my friend David Goldenberg and I produced one about Tom and his obsession that tried to get at the basic question of how we in the South remembered the Civil War.\n\nI had discovered a couple of years earlier at the Library of Congress the vast trove of photographs from the battlefields that were rarely if ever published in those days, many of them gruesome pictures of dead and bloated bodies, several of them printed on 3-D stereo cards. I thought I could use those images and Tom\u2019s obsession to tell a story contrasting an eccentric hobby and the real horror of the war.\n\nIn the event, Tom\u2019s Southern charm took over, and the climax of the film\u2014the defusing of a 100-pound shell in his basement with a sponge, a screwdriver, and a hammer\u2014is unforgettable for reasons I hadn\u2019t originally intended. But that film, posted here, was my first try at reconciling the way we think about war and talk about war, and the way war actually is, which is something I\u2019ve since spent most of my life trying to understand and explain as a foreign correspondent covering modern conflicts in several different parts of the world.\n\nAt the end of the film, we\u2019re in Tom\u2019s backyard at night on a quiet suburban street in Atlanta when he lights some powder from one of his shells. The flame casts a strange glow on his face. \u201cI do worry about it sometimes,\u201d he says. \u201cIf this house caught on fire, it could do a lot of damage around the neighborhood. You\u2019d hear the last shots fired during the Civil War.\u201d\n\nTom died of natural causes in 1987. His house never did catch on fire and the shells were destroyed or moved to a museum. But the last shots fired in the Civil War, sadly, do continue to be heard.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:43.574+0000"}

Not only does the current frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination have a history of controversial remarks about sexual assault, but as it turns out, his ex-wife Ivana Trump once used \u201crape\u201d to describe an incident between them in 1989. She later said she felt \u201cviolated\u201d by the experience.\n\nMichael Cohen, special counsel at The Trump Organization, defended his boss, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re talking about the frontrunner for the GOP, presidential candidate, as well as a private individual who never raped anybody. And, of course, understand that by the very definition, you can\u2019t rape your spouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is true,\u201d Cohen added. \u201cYou cannot rape your spouse. And there\u2019s very clear case law.\u201d\n\nIvana Trump\u2019s assertion of \u201crape\u201d came in a deposition\u2014part of the early \u201990s divorce case between the Trumps, and revealed in the 1993 book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump.\n\nThe book, by former Texas Monthly and Newsweek reporter Harry Hurt III, described a harrowing scene. After a painful scalp reduction surgery to remove a bald spot, Donald Trump confronted his then-wife, who had previously used the same plastic surgeon.\n\n\u201cYour fucking doctor has ruined me!\u201d Trump cried.\n\nWhat followed was a \u201cviolent assault,\u201d according to Lost Tycoon. Donald held back Ivana\u2019s arms and began to pull out fistfuls of hair from her scalp, as if to mirror the pain he felt from his own operation. He tore off her clothes and unzipped his pants.\n\n\u201cThen he jams his penis inside her for the first time in more than sixteen months. Ivana is terrified\u2026 It is a violent assault,\u201d Hurt writes. \u201cAccording to versions she repeats to some of her closest confidantes, \u2018he raped me.\u2019\u201d\n\nFollowing the incident, Ivana ran upstairs, hid behind a locked door, and remained there \u201ccrying for the rest of night.\u201d When she returned to the master bedroom in the morning, he was there.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the front-runner for the GOP, presidential candidate, as well as a private individual who never raped anybody. And, of course, understand that by the very definition, you can't rape your spouse.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs she looks in horror at the ripped-out hair scattered all over the bed, he glares at her and asks with menacing casualness: \u2018Does it hurt?\u2019\u201d Hurt writes.\n\nDonald Trump has previously denied the allegation. In the book, he denies having had the scalp reduction surgery.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously false,\u201d Donald Trump said of the accusation in 1993, according to Newsday. \u201cIt\u2019s incorrect and done by a guy without much talent\u2026 He is a guy that is an unattractive guy who is a vindictive and jealous person.\u201d\n\nCohen acknowledged Monday that he has not read the entire deposition but said he had read the two relevant pages of it, including the rape accusation.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the word that you\u2019re trying to make it into,\u201d Cohen told The Daily Beast, saying Ivana Trump was talking about how \u201cshe felt raped emotionally\u2026 She was not referring to it [as] a criminal matter, and not in its literal sense, though there\u2019s many literal senses to the word.\u201d\n\n\n\nCohen added that there is no such thing, legally, as a man raping his wife. \u201cYou cannot rape your spouse,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s very clear case law.\u201d\n\n\u2018Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump\u2019 by Harry Hurt III. 447 p. W W Norton & Co Inc. (Amazon)\n\nThat is not true. In New York, there used to be a so-called marital rape exemption to the law. It was struck down in 1984.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyer then changed tactics, lobbing insults and threatening a lawsuit if a story was published.\n\n\n\n\u201cI will make sure that you and I meet one day while we\u2019re in the courthouse. And I will take you for every penny you still don\u2019t have. And I will come after your Daily Beast and everybody else that you possibly know,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cSo I\u2019m warning you, tread very fucking lightly, because what I\u2019m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting. You understand me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou write a story that has Mr. Trump\u2019s name in it, with the word \u2018rape,\u2019 and I\u2019m going to mess your life up\u2026 for as long as you\u2019re on this frickin\u2019 planet\u2026 you\u2019re going to have judgments against you, so much money, you\u2019ll never know how to get out from underneath it,\u201d he added.\n\nWhen Lost Tycoon was about to be printed, Donald Trump and his lawyers provided a statement from Ivana, which was posted on the first page of the book. In it, Ivana confirms that she had \u201cfelt violated\u201d and that she had stated that her husband had raped her during a divorce deposition. But Ivana sought to soften her earlier statement.\n\n\u201cDuring a deposition given by me in connection with my matrimonial case, I stated that my husband had raped me,\u201d the Ivana Trump statement said. \u201c[O]n one occasion during 1989, Mr. Trump and I had marital relations in which he behaved very differently toward me than he had during our marriage. As a woman, I felt violated, as the love and tenderness, which he normally exhibited towards me, was absent. I referred to this as a \u2018rape,\u2019 but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\u201d\n\nThe statement, according to a \u201cNotice to the Reader\u201d in the book, \u201cdoes not contradict or invalidate any information contained in this book.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Cohen, Trump\u2019s attorney, said that \u201cthere is nothing reasonable about you wanting to write a story about somebody\u2019s usage of the word \u2018rape,\u2019 when she\u2019s talking [about how] she didn\u2019t feel emotionally satisfied.\u201d\n\n\u201cThough there\u2019s many literal senses to the word, if you distort it, and you put Mr. Trump\u2019s name there onto it, rest assured, you will suffer the consequences. So you do whatever you want. You want to ruin your life at the age of 20? You do that, and I\u2019ll be happy to serve it right up to you,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nSwerzy/AFP/Getty\n\n\u201cI think you should go ahead and you should write the story that you plan on writing. I think you should do it. Because I think you\u2019re an idiot. And I think your paper\u2019s a joke, and it\u2019s going to be my absolute pleasure to serve you with a $500 million lawsuit, like I told [you] I did it to Univision,\u201d Cohen continued.\n\n\n\nThe 1990 divorce case between the two Trumps was granted on the grounds of Donald\u2019s \u201ccruel and inhuman treatment\u201d of Ivana. The settlement, under which the Trumps agreed on the division of assets, was finalized in 1991. Her divorce involved a gag order that keeps her from talking about her marriage to Donald Trump without his permission.\n\nDivorce records in New York state are not open to public inspection. But some of the legal documents surrounding the contract dispute over the Trumps\u2019 prenuptial agreement are still available and were reviewed by The Daily Beast.\n\nIn one such document, Ivana Trump\u2019s lawyers claim that in the three years preceding their divorce Donald Trump, \u201chas increasingly verbally abused and demeaned [her] so as to obtain her submission to his wishes and desires\u201d as well as \u201chumiliated and verbally assaulted\u201d her. The New York County Clerk\u2019s records office couldn\u2019t locate at least one box of documents relating to the contract dispute. (It\u2019s not uncommon for court files to go missing.)\n\nIvana Trump did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDonald Trump has a history of grandstanding on rape. His controversial campaign-trail comments this year about Mexicans were hardly the first time he has waded into the hot-button issue of sexual assault.\n\nTwo years ago, Trump weighed in on the alarming rate of sexual assault and rape in the military\u2014and in doing so, pinned the blame on the presence of women.\n\n\u201c26,000 unreported sexual [assaults] in the military\u2014only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\u201d he tweeted in 2013. \u201cThe Generals and top military brass never wanted a mixer but were forced to do it by very dumb politicians who wanted to be politically [correct]!\u201d he continued.\n\nIn 1989, the real estate mogul placed a full-page ad in four New York City newspapers calling for the execution of the five alleged rapists of Trisha Meili, the Central Park jogger who was put in a coma by her assailants. The defendants received different sentences and served between six and 13 years behind bars before new evidence of coerced confessions emerged that led to their convictions being vacated in 2002.\n\n\u201cCriminals must be told that their CIVIL LIBERTIES END WHEN AN ATTACK ON OUR SAFETY BEGINS!\u201d Trump\u2019s 1989 ad blared. \u201cBRING BACK THE DEATH PENALTY. BRING BACK OUR POLICE!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s other public statements on rape cases range from tone-deaf to offensive. In 1992, he floated the idea that convicted rapist and boxer Mike Tyson should be allowed to pay \u201cmillions and millions\u201d of dollars to rape victims instead of serving jail time. Trump\u2019s modest proposal did not go over well.\n\n\u201cHow offensive,\u201d shot back Dollyne Pettingill, spokeswoman for the mayor of Indianapolis, where Tyson committed the assault. \u201cWe have a judicial process for these matters and it\u2019s not for sale.\u201d\n\nWhether Trump\u2019s comments about rape\u2014or the accusation of assault from his ex-wife\u2014will hurt his burgeoning political career is an open question. So far, Trump has been able to shake off the sorts of scandals that would destroy any other campaign for president. Dissing Mexican immigrants and prisoners of war has not cost him his campaign, nor has his history of giving to Democratic campaigns. In the latest CNN poll, Trump leads all other candidates in the Republican presidential field, with 18 percent support.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Nina Strochlic and Asawin Suebsaeng\n\nUpdate 7/28/15 9:50 AM: Ivana Trump released a statement Tuesday morning to CNN.\n\n\u201cI have recently read some comments attributed to me from nearly 30 years ago at a time of very high tension during my divorce from Donald. The story is totally without merit. Donald and I are the best of friends and together have raised three children that we love and are very proud of. I have nothing but fondness for Donald and wish him the best of luck on his campaign. Incidentally, I think he would make an incredible president.\u201d\n\nIronically, Ivana says a story based on her own words in a divorce deposition are \u201ctotally without merit.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn further irony, Trump is distancing himself from his lawyer.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump speaks for Mr. Trump and nobody but Mr. Trump speaks for him,\u201d a campaign source told CNN.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:43.915+0000"}
{"entityId": 1981, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "How Terry McAuliffe\u2019s campaign for governor of Virginia was a dummy run for 2016.\n\nOn Friday, Hillary Clinton will return to Virginia, her first official visit to the Commonwealth since 2013, when she headlined a rally for Terry McAuliffe, a longtime friend vying to become governor.\n\nBut Virginia has a hold on Hillary.\n\nThat\u2019s because the playbook for Clinton to win the presidency in 2016 was written in that race, which saw McAuliffe eke out a closer than expected victory against Ken Cuccinelli, the sitting attorney general and a hero to Virginia tea partiers.\n\nMany of the same people that carried McAuliffe to victory are trying to do the same for Clinton. There is Robby Mook, Clinton\u2019s well-regarded campaign manager. Josh Schwerin, who works on rapid response out of Brooklyn, served as McAuliffe\u2019s press secretary. The campaign\u2019s political director, field director and research director have all found jobs with Team Clinton.\n\nAnd many of the operatives who battled against them have gone on to the various Republican campaigns vying for the chance to take on Clinton. Danny Diaz, a senior strategist for Cuccinelli, was recently named Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign manager. Chris LaCivita, another top aide, is now helping lead Rand Paul\u2019s campaign. Wesley Donehue, who ran Cuccinelli\u2019s digital operation, is close to Marco Rubio.\n\nNow, Team Clinton is set to take the strategy that won them a medium-sized state in a low-turnout, off-year election, and take it national, while Republicans are poring over that same playbook and looking for holes.\n\nEvery campaign is unique, but McAuliffe in 2013 faced, and Clinton in 2015 faces, a similar set of challenges. Back then, McAuliffe was trying to come back from an embarrassing defeat in a Democratic primary four years earlier, much as Clinton is now.\n\nMcAuliffe was a longtime front-person for the Clinton operation, and so he was relatively well known among voters. In order to reintroduce him to Virginians, the campaign embarked on a low-key listening tour of the forgotten corners of the state, where McAuliffe heard voter concerns while scribbling notes\u2014much as Clinton did with her campaign rollout this spring.\n\n\u201cI think you see a lot of similarities,\u201d said one Republican who worked on the race. \u201cMcAulifffe was a Democrat who was trying to run a, \u2018Oh, just ignore my political past, ignore my scandal, ignore all of the background noise,\u2019 a lot like Clinton is trying to do now. And whoever the Republican is is going to have the same kind of ideological edge that Ken had.\u201d\n\nAnd, like McAuliffe, Clinton faces historical headwinds. For four decades, Virginia had followed a pattern of electing as governors someone from the party that had lost White House the year before; McAuliffe broke that pattern.\n\nClinton\u2019s team, meanwhile, acknowledges that one of her biggest hurdles will be overcoming the pattern of voters looking to a new party for leadership after two terms in the White House by the opposing party.\n\nBoth trends are not merely historical oddities, strategists say, but evidence that voters are often looking for change and tire quickly of the ruling party. If ties to Obama could prove problematic for Clinton, the botched rollout of the Obamacare website\u2014a law, it should be noted, that McAuliffe loudly championed\u2014nearly finished McAuliffe.\n\nTo counteract the gathering clouds of bad news, the McAuliffe operation put a premium on data and organizing. It\u2019s much the same with Clinton now, who has pledged to put organizers in every state and who is counting on a data operation that surpasses even the sophistication of what the Obama team put together in 2012.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Republicans realize yet how we are able to get turnout in places that are favorable to us,\u201d said one veteran of the race.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think Republicans realize yet how we are able to get turnout in places that are favorable to us,\u201d said one veteran of the race.\n\nMcAuliffe avoided a primary (not unlike Clinton, who is so far avoiding a competitive one) but still took strikingly liberal positions on social issues regardless. This is proof, Democratic veterans of his campaign say, that the center of the electorate is shifting rapidly away from the Republicans.\n\nClinton is trying the same strategy, staking out liberal positions on gay rights, immigration, the economy, and the environment with the belief that the center of the electorate is far closer to the Democratic base on these matters.\n\nBut the governor\u2019s race was not one in which the Democrats touted McAuliffe much; rather, they made the race all about Cuccinelli, an unabashed conservative who bragged of his record of suing the federal government and who opposed gay marriage and abortion. This did not make for a particularly joyful campaign, with Time magazine branding it \u201cThe Dirtiest, Nastiest, Low-Down Campaign in America.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is significant is that McAuliffe was able to win it even with pretty low turnout, and he did it because the Republicans gave him a far-right candidate and he was relentless on the social issues,\u201d said Larry Sabato, the director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cThis is a transferable issue in 2016, and one that Republicans are vulnerable on, no question about it.\u201d\n\nMcAullife, he added, was merely \u201cthe non-Cuccinelli on the ballot. And if Hillary Clinton wins, it is for the same reason that McAuliffe wins\u2014not because they are exciting or because people love them but because they are the other guy on the ballot.\u201d\n\nAlthough Cuccinelli lost by a little over two points, Republicans say that he outperformed expectations. Polls in the final weeks of the race had Cuccinelli down by close to ten. He was outspent by $15 million, and swamped on the airwaves in the race\u2019s final weeks.\n\nBut Republicans from around the country have highlighted an exit poll that showed him beating McAuliffe among voters age 18-24. Republicans say this is proof that the youngest cohort of the millennial generation is less focused on social issues and less likely to vote Democratic when Obama is not on the ballot.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t enough. And the main lesson Republicans took from the near-upset hold has to do with the primary.

Team Bush has responded to the story, and \u2013 based on this Tweet from Jeb Bush, Jr. (which his dad Re-Tweeted) \u2013 the strategy appears to be to try to downplay the story by poking fun at it.\n\nThat might be there best hope, because there is potential this could turn into a big deal, electorally speaking. That's because this kind of symbolic thing is easy to mock (see Elizabeth Warren) -- and easier to understand -- than some policy proposal.\n\nThe most damaging gaffes are the ones that reinforce a preexisting narrative about someone. A very vocal and activist segment of the Republican primary base is vehemently opposed to anything that looks like \u201camnesty,\u201d and Jeb\u2019s support for immigration reform already has him in hot water with this contingent of the GOP. This latest revelation is amnesty on steroids. It personalizes what was, heretofore, a policy story. Bush can now be portrayed as someone who has \"gone native\" with the amnesty gang, and is no longer \"one of us.\"\n\nWhen Sen. Marco Rubio was pushing immigration reform, buttons started popping up branding him a \"RINO\" who wants \"AMNISTIA.\" The fact that these buttons looked similar to a Mexican flag, and featured Rubio wearing a sombrero, only added to the subtlety. Already, the New York Times and The Week (where I also write) have associated photos with stories about this topic showing Bush surrounded by mariachi bands and/or men wearing sombreros. Those are the mainstream outlets. Wait till the blogs get hold of this. (And don't get me started on talk radio...)\n\nI have no idea why he checked that box, but it is reasonable to say he's married to a Latina, his kids are Hispanic, and he lives in an area where he can probably go till lunch before speaking anything other than Spanish.\n\nUnless this gets fixed, the conservative base (which is decidedly and passionately opposed to immigration reform, and already hostile to Bush) will use this as a cudgel to relentlessly mock and attack Bush.\n\nTo a certain extent, they have a point: Bush's cultural experience is far different from that of most Americans. I have no idea why he checked that box, but it is reasonable to say he's married to a Latina, his kids are Hispanic, and he lives in an area where he can probably go till lunch before speaking anything other than Spanish. This is not to say he's un-American, but it is to say he's international and cosmopolitan, and really, to a lot of folks, that's pretty much a distinction without a difference.\n\nIn reality, though, the difference is huge. As noted earlier, there will be comparisons to Sen. Warren. But Elizabeth Warren presumably benefited from her bogus Native American status. Bush had nothing to gain (and as it turns out, a lot to lose) by identifying as Hispanic.\n\nJeb\u2019s political ideology is such that he doesn't think anyone should benefit from identity politics -- that merit, not ethnicity, is what should matter. Liberals like Warren believe that certain minority groups should get preferential treatment; Jeb, as a conservative, does not, and as such it doesn\u2019t really matter what ethnicity he chooses to identify as. Heck, as Florida governor, Bush even went so far as to end affirmative action in the state.\n\nAs the New York Times reported in 2000:\n\n\"There is widespread support among whites for Mr. Bush's program, which would end preferences for businesses owned by women and minorities in bidding for state contracts. And it would end college admissions preferences based on race, substituting a program guaranteeing admission to at least 1 of the 10 state universities for high school students who graduate in the top 20 percent of their class.\"\n\n\n\nBush is wise to try and diffuse this with humor, but only time will tell if that works. This could still be politically damaging. But that doesn't mean it should be. Jeb's WASPy family background only makes this story more delicious, but practically speaking, he probably is culturally Hispanic, and of course there's nothing wrong with that. What we should be interested in is the fact that, as governor, he supported conservative policies, and has a long history of rejecting identity politics. For that, at least, we should be saying \u00a1Viva Jeb!", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:45.662+0000"}

Bill Clinton has always been too much the quicksilver seducer wooing crowds to be the Churchillian orator delivering chisel-worthy lines. And although Hillary Clinton would happily forget some doozies, her most pungent lines have charted her public evolution\u2014and American women\u2019s journey\u2014since the 1990s.\n\nBack in January 1992, when most Americans first \u201cmet\u201d Hillary Clinton, she uttered a memorable, regrettable line. To refute accusations of adultery both Clintons denied for years until he confirmed them, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared on a special \u201cSixty Minutes\u201d segment, broadcast right after the Super Bowl. As Steve Kroft probed, asking, \u201cWhat do you mean \u2026 that your marriage has had problems?\u201d and Bill Clinton parried, Hillary finally snapped: \u201cYou know, I\u2019m not sitting here [like] some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.\u201d Her snide reference to a legendary country star\u2019s ode to fidelity offended millions of fans.\n\nTwo months later, with word of Whitewater financial chicanery first seeping out, Mrs. Clinton insulted millions of homemakers by boasting, \u201cI suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas. But what I decided to do was pursue my profession.\u201d Her sharp tongue confirmed anti-feminist stereotypes of career women disdaining American homemakers. Journalists cruelly branded her \u201cthe overbearing Yuppie Wife from Hell.\u201d\n\nIn the White House, the backlash against Hillary as the first Feminist First Lady ultimately required a retreat. Rather than function as \u201cco-president,\u201d rather than lead America toward a \u201cpolitics of meaning,\u201d as she hoped, she became a more traditional First Lady, with a modern twist. In September, 1995, her bold speech in China for the United Nations\u2019 Fourth World Conference on Women upset American and Chinese diplomats. \u201cIf there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s rights are human rights once and for all,\u201d she said, coining this memorable phrase. The New York Times said the speech \u201cmay have been her finest moment in public life.\u201d Alas, her husband undermined her by claiming \u201cThere was no attempt to single any country out.\u201d\n\nThe next year, her best-selling, Grammy-Award winning book, It Takes a Village, was the most dramatic mark of her makeover, while launching another epoch-defining phrase. In accepting the 1996 Republican nomination, Senator Bob Dole would sneer: \u201cit does not take a village to raise a child; it takes a family to raise a child.\u201d\n\nHillary\u2019s publicizing of this African folk teaching marked a milestone in American cultural history. Equal parts Martha Stewart, Nancy Reagan, and Jane Addams, her book reflected the odyssey of the Clintons\u2019 Baby Boomer peers who had rejected traditional mores only to rediscover them. Clinton publicized studies showing that divorce, drugs, and promiscuity are bad, and \u201cevery child\u201d needs an \u201cintact, dependable family.\u201d This was Hillary the super-mom and aphorist, helping her husband win re-election as America\u2019s \u201cGood Father.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, Bill Clinton was a better father than husband. In January 1998, as the Monica Lewinsky scandal unfolded, Hillary Clinton had to save her husband\u2019s presidency. The First Lady had long struggled over the First Family\u2019s \u201czone of privacy,\u201d a phrase from the 1965 Griswold v. Connecticut case reading into the Constitution a right of privacy that allowed married people to buy birth control. In April 1994, apologizing for awkwardly handling Whitewater files, Hillary had joked that her \u201czone of privacy\u201d was being \u201crezoned.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuman rights are women\u2019s rights and women\u2019s rights are human rights once and for all.\u201d\n\nFour years later, in 1998, Hillary Clinton spearheaded the counterattack against the \u201cvast right-wing conspiracy\u201d out to destroy her husband. Not since the widowed Jackie Kennedy waxed emotional about \u201cCamelot\u201d had a First Lady uttered a more potent phrase. The scandal would paralyze Washington for months\u2014but Hillary\u2019s words helped keep her wandering man living in the White House.\n\nRunning for president in 2008, Hillary Clinton was out-matched by the silver-tongued, \u201cYes We Can\u201d candidate Barack Obama. Her best line came from her campaign commercial asking: \u201cIt\u2019s 3 a.m., and your children are safe and asleep\u2026. Who do you want answering the phone?\u201d The ad then showed a serious, reliable, Hillary Clinton, answering the phone, protecting the nation.\n\nStill, Hillary lost. In her graceful concession speech, hailing the record number of votes cast for America\u2019s first serious female presidential candidate, she weaponized a by-now familiar clich\u00e9, \u201cAlthough we weren't able to shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling this time,\u201d she said, \u201cthanks to you, it\u2019s got about 18 million cracks in it.\u201d\n\nWhile repeatedly Bartlett\u2019s Book of Quotations-worthy, Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s success as America\u2019s wordsmith reflects her political career\u2019s defining paradox. These phrases have been weapons in America\u2019s gender wars, fired from various angles. Hillary Clinton has repeatedly rejected the shackles American expectations have foisted on her. She resisted being a stand-by-your-man woman, a stay-at-home mom, a cuckolded wife, or a loser limited by that \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling.\u201d She wants to be the human rights and women\u2019s rights campaigner. She wants to be the bold political navigator re-zoning the zone of privacy, defeating the vast right-wing conspiracy, emerging as the toughest, boldest, most visionary, most experienced, person in the room 24/7, not just at 3 A.M.\n\nYet the identity politics that boosted her career imprisons her. Following 1994\u2019s \u201cangry white man\u2019s\u201d revolt that elected a Republican Congress for the first time in 40 years, Mrs. Clinton concluded: \u201cI\u2019m the projection for many of those wounded men. I\u2019m the boss they never wanted to have.\u201d Fourteen years later, Fox News would inadvertently confirm her fears of sexism with an ugly \u201cexpert\u2019s\u201d report claiming that when male voters hear Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cnagging voice,\u201d they hear: \u201cTake out the garbage.\u201d\n\nJust as Barack Obama remains defined by the four-word headline, \u201cAmerica\u2019s First Black President,\u201d Hillary Clinton will be most defined by how far she goes\u2014or doesn\u2019t go\u2014as America\u2019s First Serious Female Presidential Candidate. Yet while that identity motivates millions of \u201cit\u2019s our time\u201d supporters, it risks preventing her from being seen as a president of all the people. How she solves that conundrum will determine her fate in 2016, and define her legacy.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:45.963+0000"}

Just hours after watching Rambo endure agonizing electrical torture by Vietnamese captors, Rafael piped up about the scene. It was a rare window into his treatment by the Batista regime.\n\n\u201cYou know, the Cubans weren\u2019t nearly that fancy in their torture methods. They would just come into your jail cell every couple of hours and beat the crap out of you. And then they\u2019d do it again and again,\u201d Rafael Cruz said, according to his son, a Republican senator from Texas and the author of a forthcoming book, A Time for Truth.\n\nRafael Cruz endured savage beatings and bleak conditions: \u201ca rotten cell, acrid with the smell of blood, grime, urine,\u201d the senator writes, according to excerpts of the book obtained by The Daily Beast. \u201cMen with clubs beat him. His captors broke his nose when they kicked him in the head with their army boots. They bashed in his front teeth until they dangled from his mouth.\u201d\n\nRafael never broke under torture, refusing to tell his captors who else he had been working with in the Cuban underground. And somehow, the senator writes, his father survived his captivity.\n\n\u201cHe had heard of too many rebels who had broken and had been shot, with their bodies dumped in the street. That fear kept him from breaking,\u201d Cruz writes. \u201cMy dad, a Cuban immigrant who sometimes seems larger than life, has always been my hero. He has always felt a visceral urgency about politics. Having the right people in office was vitally important to my dad, as if it were a matter of life and death. Because for him, in a very literal sense, it was.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear whether the hawkish senator\u2019s thinking on enhanced interrogation techniques might be affected by his family\u2019s experience with torture.\n\nWhen The Daily Beast has asked Cruz about the Bush-era interrogation techniques in the past, he hasn\u2019t specifically addressed or condemned them. He has instead responded by condemning torture in general terms, without weighing in on the specific techniques. In his book, the senator refers to Guantanamo Bay naval facility as a \u201crenowned U.S. military outpost.\u201d\n\nBut the Cruz family\u2019s experience with torture has influenced the senator\u2019s thinking on sexual assault. In recent years the Republican has teamed up with Democratic Senator Kirsten Gillibrand for a measure sought by military sexual assault victims\u2019 advocates: to remove the chain of command from decisions about whether sexual assault cases go to trial. Cruz\u2019s activism on sexual assault, which goes back at least to his college days, was inspired by his aunt\u2019s experiences in Cuba.\n\n\u201cWe were in front of a large computer screen gazing at explicit, hard-core pornography. As we examined the screen before us, I remember very distinctly what the sixty-five-year-old O\u2019Connor said.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn my own family, my aunt experienced terrible abuse in prison in Cuba, and that made protecting women from assault all the more personal,\u201d the senator told Business Insider in 2014.\n\nCruz addresses his aunt\u2019s abuse in a brief passage in the book\u2014which begins abruptly:\n\n\u201cShe fought against Castro, trying to topple him from power. And, sadly, she too faced prison and torture. Castro\u2019s goons threw Sonia and her two best friends in prison\u2014all of them were teenage girls\u2014and brutalized them. I love my T\u00eda Sonia\u2014she\u2019s a wonderful, passionate, loving person\u2014and we don\u2019t talk about what she experienced in that Cuban jail.\u201d\n\nIf nothing else, Cruz knows how to start a chapter. Writing about his law career, the senator mentions looking at pornography with Supreme Court Justices William Rehnquist and Sandra Day O\u2019Connor.\n\n\u201cWe were in front of a large computer screen gazing at explicit, hard-core pornography. As we examined the screen before us, I remember very distinctly what the sixty-five-year-old O\u2019Connor said,\u201d Cruz writes.\n\nSadly, the excerpt obtained by The Daily Beast doesn\u2019t include the end of that story.\n\nThe first chapter of Cruz\u2019s book is a deep dive into the senator\u2019s family history with a series of fascinating anecdotes. His father was born in the city of Matanzas, which means \u201cmassacre\u201d in Spanish, reflecting the place\u2019s violent past. His grandfather started from humble beginnings, purchasing a fruit stand, graduating to a grocery store\u2014and then losing it by overextending credit to customers. His grandmother faked insanity, screaming nonsense and foaming at the mouth, to get out of indoctrinating students with communist beliefs she opposed.\n\nBut it is in his father\u2019s story that Cruz finds common ground with Barack Obama, a president he has so frequently denounced. The senator writes in great detail about his father\u2019s decision to flee Cuba for Texas, landing with almost nothing and working as a dishwasher at an Austin diner. Rafael learned English in part by watching movies over and over again, learning words from context and intonation.\n\n\u201cAmerica, quite simply, saved my father. America gave him a chance\u2026The freedom of America was the dream that allowed him to endure the brutality of Cuba. It was and is a beacon of hope for all those who, like him, have endured oppression,\u201d Cruz writes.\n\nIt is on the uniqueness of the American safe haven that Cruz relates his family\u2019s experience to that of the Democratic president\u2019s.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama, noting his own rise from humble beginnings, has observed that \u2018in no other country on earth is my story even possible.\u2019 My family can relate to that sentiment.

{"entityId": 1985, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Reince Priebus isn\u2019t going to come down too hard on Donald. Trump has the power to elect Clinton, and both he and Priebus know it.\n\nDeflating as it is, the likely Donald Trump scenario is this: He burns hot for a little while longer; he says something really out there in the first debate that roils up the base but makes Reince Priebus and Karl Rove break out in canker sores; but by the time of the baseball playoffs maybe, his act gets old, and somebody else becomes the Herman Cain of October. Then, next year, the primaries will start, and he\u2019ll have to get votes. He\u2019s not going to be all that competitive in Iowa, so it\u2019s New Hampshire where he\u2019ll need to deliver something. And if he doesn\u2019t, he\u2019ll just go away.\n\nThat\u2019s the pattern anyway. I seem to recall that at this point in 2011, Michele Bachmann had a pretty good head of steam going. So maybe we shouldn\u2019t get too overheated about him.\n\nBut Trump is different from Bachmann, and even from fellow entrepreneur Cain, in one major respect: He doesn\u2019t give a crap about the Republican Party. He cares about Trump. And don\u2019t forget he has the power singlehandedly to make Hillary Clinton president. He knows it, and you better believe Priebus knows it, and it is this fact that establishes a power dynamic between Trump and the GOP in which Trump totally has the upper hand and can make mischief in the party for months.\n\nHow does he have the power to elect Clinton all by himself? By running as an independent. Two factors usually prevent candidates who lose nominations from running as independents. One, they lack the enormous amount of money needed to pursue that path (pay the lawyers to get them on 50 state ballots, etc.). Two, they have a sense of proportion and decency, and they figure that if primary voters rejected them, it\u2019s time to go home.\n\nWell, Trump has the dough and lacks the decency. In an interview this week with Byron York, he left the door open a crack to such a candidacy. And that would be all it would take. Given his fame and name recognition, he\u2019d likely hit the polling threshold needed to qualify for the fall debates. And with that kind of exposure, he\u2019d do well\u2014enough. All he needs to get is 5 percent of the vote in Florida, Ohio, Virginia, and Colorado, and the Republican, whoever it is, is sizzled. Another electoral landslide.\n\nHow does he have the power to elect Clinton all by himself? By running as an independent.\n\nThe question is, would he? And the answer is, who knows? To York, he expressed awareness of the obvious drawbacks, pointing to the spoiler role he says Ross Perot played in 1992: \u201cI think every single vote that went to Ross Perot came from [George H.W.] Bush\u2026Virtually every one of his 19 percentage points came from the Republicans. If Ross Perot didn\u2019t run, you have never heard of Bill Clinton.\u201d He is\u2014shocker\u2014wrong about this, but what matters for present purposes is that he believes it, so maybe that means he wouldn\u2019t follow through.\n\nBut he is an unpredictable fellow. Suppose Priebus and the GOP piss him off in some way, and he thinks the hell with these losers. Suppose he decides\u2014and don\u2019t doubt the importance of this\u2014that an independent run would be good for the Trump brand in the long run. And suppose he doesn\u2019t actually mind so much the idea of Hillary Clinton being president. We already know he retains a soft spot for old Bill. And he donated to Hillary Clinton\u2019s senatorial campaign.\n\nAll that\u2019s speculative. But even in the here and now this dynamic has consequences. It means the GOP can\u2019t afford to offend Trump. This is why Priebus\u2019s spokesman characterized the chairman\u2019s Wednesday evening phone chat with Trump as \u201cvery respectful.\u201d\n\nAnd it\u2019s why the other candidates\u2019 criticisms of him have been a little, ah, restrained. Politicians aren\u2019t always real smart about any number of things, but one thing in my experience that they almost always have a very keen sense of is risk. Members of Congress, for example, generally know exactly what percentage of their electorate they\u2019re going to sacrifice by casting X vote. Jeb Bush\u2019s Trump criticisms are muted because he has a lot to lose by offending Trump and his supporters. Chris Christie, who\u2019s little more than an asterisk in the polls, has less to lose, so he\u2019s willing to be a bit more blunt. Same goes for Rick Perry.\n\nWe\u2019ll see if Trump has developed that politician\u2019s sense of risk. If he goes too far, one or certainly two more equivalents of \u201cMexican rapists,\u201d it\u2019ll be open season on him. He\u2019s at a point of maximum leverage right now, and if he wants to stay there, he\u2019s got to tuck it in about 10 or 15 percent and start employing the kind of racialized euphemisms that are not only tolerated but celebrated within the Republican Party\u2014build the damn fence, no amnesty, al Qaeda is storming the mainland through Obama\u2019s porous border, etc. That way, he\u2019ll hang around. And he\u2019ll build enough of a following that the threat of a viable independent candidacy remains a real one. And that is Trump\u2019s trump card. And it makes Reince Priebus a very nervous man.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:46.714+0000"}

Here\u2019s why his lies matter.\n\nOh happy day\u2014freshman Texas Senator Ted Cruz is set to announce that he\u2019s running for president. And he\u2019s not going to announce at the Alamo or any other defiant Texas-type monument. He\u2019s making a pilgrimage straight to the birthplace of the Moral Majority, the Jerry Falwell-founded Liberty University. The setting makes sense for a man who believes that God has called him to politics. After all, the only way to top shutting down the government is to try to run the government into the ground himself.\n\nThis month, Cruz released a short video that\u2019s the best evidence yet for what a Cruz presidential campaign might be like. It\u2019s called \u201cA Time for Truth,\u201d and the title has to be intentional irony.\n\nCruz\u2019s Politifact track record for publicly-asserted falsehoods is the second-highest among front-runners, totaling 56 percent of all statements they\u2019ve looked at. The only other leading contender with a higher rating is Ben Carson, who has a 100 percent \u201cpants on fire\u201d history, the result mainly of his brief time in the national spotlight and only having given Politifact one assertion to check\u2014that people choose to be gay. (The investigative process on verifying that claim could have been entertaining, had Carson taken up Dan Savage\u2019s invitation to take a very personal version of the Pepsi Challenge. Politifact chose a less experiential approach.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just Cruz\u2019s habit of embellishment that makes the video\u2019s title more wish-fulfillment than description. One would expect a video entitled \u201cA Time for Truth\u201d to contain, you know, truth. Or calls to speak the truth, at the very least. Cruz\u2019s infomercial, on the other hand, is simply a collection of Cruz clips wherein he apparently confuses speaking the truth with speaking very dramatically and forcefully. It is the Ugly American approach to foreign language in moral form.\n\nWatch as Cruz loudly proclaims he will stand up for various things! He also asks for others to stand up for things! It\u2019s a tic in the vernacular of the evangelical subculture Cruz hails from to think of extravagantly passionate sincerity as evidence of honesty and probity. So perhaps Cruz\u2019s substitution of one for the other is not an intentional bait-and-switch.\n\nLet\u2019s indulge a thought experiment: What if, in all those cases where Cruz\u2019s passionate sincerity has been found to be trustworthy, he meant what he said at the time?\n\nWe take it for granted that politicians lie to gain votes, to make themselves more appealing, or to make someone else look bad. But what if Cruz wasn\u2019t craven, but instead as sincere as he sounds. What would that mean?\n\nCruz isn\u2019t just looking at different data, he\u2019s living in a different universe.\n\nThere are objective falsehoods that show Cruz could just be looking at a different set of data. Other, more telling whoppers show that Cruz isn\u2019t just looking at different data, he\u2019s living in a different universe.\n\nThe former category contains his insistence that there\u2019s no such thing as global warming. The latter kind of lie is why Cruz can look a child in the eye and tell her the world is on fire.\n\nMultiple news organizations have found fault with this standard refrain from his stump speech: \u201cThere are 110,000 agents at the IRS. We need to put a padlock on that building and take every one of those 110,000 agents and put them on our southern border.\u201d There are not 110,000 agents at the IRS. There aren\u2019t even that many employees. There are about 82,000, of whom about 14,000 are agents.\n\nBut that\u2019s just a fact-check of the first sentence; what about the underlying notion that there\u2019s some kind of equivalence between what accountants do and the kind of peacekeeping one might need at the border?\n\nThe most generous interpretation might be that Cruz thinks we\u2019re not keeping track of our immigrants; more paperwork is in order. (True enough!) The spookier option is that he thinks IRS agents are as militarized as your local police force, and they would be the group to finally wrest \u201c100 percent operational control\u201d (an Orwellian-sounding metric Cruz often invokes but never explains) in the region.\n\nCruz\u2019s fantasy life, understandably, gets warmer and fuzzier closer to home. Take his version of the aw-shucks, I-don\u2019t-deserve-her, backhandedly condescending marital anecdote that male candidates are required to have. It casts his decision to run for Senate as a moment of unexpected validation:\n\nHe recalled saying to his wife in the weeks before his Senate primary, when he was still behind in the polls, \u201cSweetheart, I\u2019d like us to liquidate our entire net worth, liquid net worth, and put it into the campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat astonished me, then and now, was Heidi within 60 seconds said, \u2018Absolutely,\u2019 with no hesitation,\u201d said Mr. Cruz, who invested about $1.2 million\u2014\u201cwhich is all we had saved,\u201d he added\u2014into his campaign.\n\nHeidi Cruz herself recalls the conversation differently. There was no movie-friendly smash cut \u201cabsolutely,\u201d or even assent. Rather, she told Politico, she \u201cwanted him to raise money from elsewhere first, to show that the support was out there.\u201d And even then, \u201cShe proposed that they not put their own cash into the campaign unless it made the difference between winning and losing.\u201d That\u2019s sort of the opposite of an instantaneous absolutely: a hesitant and conditional maybe.\n\nMaybe Ted\u2019s version is just the kind of face-saving white lie we tell ourselves to preserve harmony in a relationship. After all, it\u2019s easier and healthier than nursing a grudge. Or, in Cruz\u2019s mind, a hesitant and conditional maybe, if it relates to something he wants bad enough, is enthusiastic agreement.\n\nThis is delusion would explain almost everything Ted Cruz does.\n\nThat would explain Cruz\u2019s misguided belief that a wide swath of Americans want to repeal Obamacare. It would explain his quixotic crusade against the country\u2019s growing support for marriage equality. It would make sense, even, of his run for the presidency.\n\nCruz, after all, is a \u201ctop-tier\u201d candidate mostly in terms of name recognition. While he\u2019s an extremely popular speaker at base-flaming events such as CPAC (where he finished third in the easily gamed Straw Poll), wider swaths of GOP voters are not as kind. Even among the notoriously conservative Republican Iowa caucus-goers he\u2019s in single digits. In the even narrower category of self-identified Iowa Tea Partiers, he has only 10 percent of the vote, trailing Ben Carson (11 percent), Rand Paul (15 percent) and flavor of the month Scott Walker (33 percent).\n\nTo be fair, most politicians who run for president have some strain of the megalomania that seems to infect Cruz. Almost every politician who runs for president needs to have that curious mental twist, an ego like a funhouse mirror. Otherwise, no one except those already likely to win would run. Ask some liberal Democrats how they feel about that scenario.\n\nBut the most successful politicians seem to leaven self-importance with data. Obama\u2019s 2008 victory over the inevitable Hillary Clinton is often painted in terms of pure marketing, but it was number-crunching that made the difference in the nitty-gritty days of the final states. Bill Clinton often looks like an example of sentiment prevailing over smarts, but his career\u2019s lows reflect the times when he didn\u2019t turn off the charm.\n\nTell the truth, Ted Cruz says.

Praise David Dinkins.\n\nThe Bonfire of the Vanities came to Baltimore and, in the process, the Democrats may have lost their shot at regaining the Senate in 2016 and holding on to the White House. Perhaps I should explain.\n\nWe have been down this road before.\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon rode urban unrest and the failures of the Great Society to victory. Twenty years later, George H.W. Bush pummeled Mike Dukakis, a card-carrying ACLU member and the Democratic governor of Massachusetts, over weekend furloughs for convicted murderers, and won a third consecutive presidential term for the Republican Party, the first such term in 60 years.\n\nAnd now the question: Will the voters, as opposed to the pundits and bloggers, side more with Freddie Gray or with six cops, three of them black, and one of them a woman?\n\nAccording to a Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll released Sunday, a majority of Americans and almost three-in-five whites blame the rioters and looters for the rioting and looting\u2014not the cops and not the system. At the same time, 96 percent of America expect a hot summer ahead.\n\nMessage to Hillary Clinton: Law and order still counts.\n\nYet, Clinton has embraced the demands of the urban end of the Democrats\u2019 upstairs-downstairs coalition, history be damned. Her campaign rollout video had no footage of cops or firefighters. Then, last week, as the keynote speaker at Columbia University\u2019s 18th Annual David N. Dinkins Leadership and Public Policy Forum (the fate of Dinkins, defeated for reelection after a single term because of the law-and-order issue, ought to tell her something), Clinton demanded body cameras in every police department in the country, and the end to an \u201cera of mass incarceration.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s trite trope of there being no red or blue America is dead. The reality is that the Brazilification of America has arrived.\n\nThe speech, which has garnered praise among Democrats and their fans, will haunt her in the future because content and venue matter. Columbia is more than just Barack Obama\u2019s alma mater. In 1968, Columbia was home to student riots, during which the kids turned the office of Columbia\u2019s president into a latrine, took a dean hostage, faced-off against the NYPD, and had the chutzpah to demand the right to both riot and to collect academic honors.\n\nOh, and a-half-year later, Nixon beat Hubert Humphrey, against the backdrop of the Ivy League run amok, and riots in Baltimore, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Wilmington, Delaware \u2013 the heart of Blue America, what was then New Deal America. That was all just a coincidence, no cause and effect there?\n\nAs for Dinkins, crime and \u201cspiraling welfare rolls\u201d characterized his tenure as York City mayor between 1990 and 1993. With Dinkins as mayor, New York witnessed more than 2,000 murders annually. Times sure do change. The one-term Dinkins has been elevated to a Clinton prop.\n\nYet, all of this is ironic. It\u2019s not just that Bill Clinton actually was the law-and-order president who ended welfare as we knew it. It\u2019s that while Bill was scrambling to win the 1992 Democratic nomination, he got off of the campaign trail to preside over the execution of Ricky Ray Rector for the 1981 murder of Robert Martin, a Conway, Arkansas police officer.\n\nWhen executed, Rector had an I.Q. of around 70, after partially lobotomizing himself with a gunshot to the head after he committed his crimes. Not surprisingly, Hillary has said nothing about the late and not-so-great Mr. Rector. She\u2019s \u201cevolving.\u201d\n\nWhile Clinton was staying mum about her husband\u2019s record on crime, Barack Obama was taking Congress to task for not embracing his urban agenda. As Obama put it, \u201cI\u2019m under no illusion that under this Congress we\u2019re going to get massive investments in urban communities,\u201d as if prior investments in Urban America have been a cure-all.\n\nLet\u2019s go to the video. In the days since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society, Baltimore has gone from our seventh largest city to 23rd, Detroit has filed for bankruptcy, and Cleveland is a shadow of its old self. Sure, the Cavaliers have LeBron and are in the hunt for an NBA title, but Cleveland\u2019s population has shrunk to under 400,000\u2014the voters are now in the suburbs. As for Chicago, it has carved out a niche for gangs and gun violence, and Blue America is the hands-down home to our most segregated cities.\n\nObama\u2019s trite trope of there being no red or blue America is dead. Sure, it made for a great aspirational rallying cry, and it helped him win the presidency. But the reality is that the Brazilification of America has arrived. The Baltimore police officers charged in the Gray shooting were not a monolith. They were male and female, ebony and ivory.\n\nDemographics, however, don\u2019t fully explain why Obama is engaging in studied finger pointing. Rather, it\u2019s also about the failings of Obama\u2019s own 2009 stimulus, or what Michelle Obama acknowledged was the Great Society Redux. As Jonathan Alter recounted in his book, The Promise:\n\nA congressman approached the first lady at a White House reception after the bill\u2019s passage and told her the stimulus was the best anti-poverty bill in a generation. Her reaction was \u201cShhhh!\u201d The White House didn\u2019t want the public thinking that Obama had achieved long-sought public policy objectives under the guise of merely stimulating the economy, even though that\u2019s exactly what had happened.\n\nSo how did that work out? Well, the country is out of the Great Recession, but our economy has since crawled back to almost a halt. First-quarter GDP grew at an anemic 0.2 percent, while the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank projects second-quarter GDP to inch-up to a paltry 0.9 percent. Race and crime are all too tragically in the news, and now it looks like we have not gotten our money\u2019s worth from Obama\u2019s first social experiment a/k/a the stimulus.\n\nToday, Clinton is widely distrusted, even though she is the front-runner. Meanwhile, protesters chant, \u201cno justice, no peace; no racist police,\u201d and PBS\u2019s Tavis Smiley prophesies that \u201cprotests and riots\u2014uprisings\u2014could become the new normal. Welcome to the new America.\u201d\n\nNew America? More like 1968, and that portends badly for Clinton and the Democrats. If our cities go up in flames, Mitch McConnell may be sticking around for a while longer as Senate Majority Leader. As for Clinton, her ambitions may become roadkill to the Coalition of the Ascendant, and one more burnt offering to the Bonfire.\n\nOn Saturday night, Demetrius Johnson, an-ex con with a long and violent rap sheet, was arrested after he shot one of New York\u2019s Finest in the face. The officer, Brian Moore, is the \u201cfifth NYPD officer shot since last December,\u201d according to the New York Daily News. Mayor Bill de Blasio, who managed Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate campaign, lamented the shooting as an \u201cunconscionable act of violence\u201d and \u201ca reminder of the dangers that all of our officers face every single day.\u201d\n\nFunny, not a word about mass incarcerations.

It\u2019s a very different world but still frighteningly similar in the assumptions made about female candidates.\n\nClinton has shattered stereotypes about women and fundraising, and she\u2019s put in place a campaign infrastructure that surpasses any of her rivals. Fiorina is testing the boundaries of what once might have been dismissed as a catfight by taking direct aim at Clinton. And both camps are exploring how much gender solidarity exists with fewer glass ceilings and a millennial generation that is much more willing to elect a woman to the White House.\n\nDemocratic Representative Schroeder said the thing that made her nuts was people saying, \u201cI just can\u2019t imagine having a man for First Lady. How do you relate to that? Images are so hard to crack.\u201d For example, how do you show a woman working hard? With a man, he loosens his tie and rolls up his sleeves. Women look like unmade beds or models, she said.\n\nSchroeder coined the phrase \u201cTeflon president\u201d for Ronald Reagan, and she took on the sexism in Congress, declaring, \u201cI have a uterus and a brain and I use them both.\u201d A long-serving member of Congress on the Armed Services Committee, she dropped out of the \u201988 race in September \u201987, before any votes were cast. She said the media covered her only when she spoke to women\u2019s groups.\n\nAmbassador Braun was the first and still only African-American woman elected to the U.S. Senate. After serving a single term and losing her bid for reelection, she ran for president in 2004 after a short stint as ambassador to New Zealand. She dropped out before the Iowa caucus, but lives on in the highlight reel of debates with her quip that the black vote decided the 2000 election\u2014Clarence Thomas\u2019s vote in the Bush v. Gore Supreme Court decision.\n\nMoney was a problem for both women, but they were also running against ingrained images of what a president is supposed to look like.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the equivalent of looking large and in charge,\u201d said Braun in a conference call organized by the Barbara Lee Family Foundation, which is partnering with the Center for American Women and Politics to provide historical context for the current race.\n\n\u201cThe concept of a woman reviewing the troops is almost incomprehensible.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe concept of a woman reviewing the troops is almost incomprehensible,\u201d she said. \u201cWill we have the equivalent of Angela Merkel? I hope so\u2026You have to navigate cultural quicksand in a way no male candidate has to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe commander in chief thing is a hang-up,\u201d agreed Schroeder, who was criticized for crying in the press conference when she withdrew from the presidential race. Irked by what she perceives as a double standard, Schroeder for years kept a \u201ccrying folder\u201d filled with newspaper clips of men who were applauded for crying.\n\nA woman getting into it with another woman was always dangerous territory. Several times in a congressional career that spanned the \u201970s, \u201980s and \u201990s, Schroeder faced a female opponent for her congressional seat. \u201cWe had to be so careful. The media wanted to make it a catfight. We had to make it a tea party.\u201d\n\nLeslie Sanchez, a Republican consultant on the conference call, said she has gotten lots of calls about Fiorina and the way she goes after Clinton. Some say it\u2019s a catfight but Sanchez says, \u201cThat\u2019s her style, she\u2019s very direct. People can make of it what they want it to be.\u201d\n\nMuch of what Schroeder and Braun had to say is turned on its head by Clinton, who can hold her own on any of the standard ways a campaign is measured. Toughness doesn\u2019t appear to be her problem, and after watching her perform as secretary of state, reviewing the troops doesn\u2019t seem out of bounds as an image that Americans could get comfortable with.\n\nBut there are clues in these earlier campaigns to what some Democrats are giving voice to, and that is the lack of enthusiasm for Clinton and the historic nature of her candidacy. She is no Barack Obama, exciting young people and minorities; she doesn\u2019t have her husband\u2019s empathy with the voters, and she\u2019s not a one-woman reality show who can (almost) fill a stadium the way Donald Trump can.\n\nTo win, she needs the sisterhood to turn out in force, and the historical data isn\u2019t there. Kathleen Harrington, deputy campaign manager for Elizabeth Dole\u2019s 2000 presidential race, said on the call that older women\u2014women older than Dole, who was 54 at the time, were \u201cincredibly supportive.\u201d Among women over 60, \u201cThere was hunger for a woman president,\u201d said Harrington. Younger women, not so much\u2014they\u2019ve got time for history.\n\nThe rallying cry since the 1980s is that the time for women had come, and in 2008 when Clinton ran for president, \u201cWe really assumed women would gravitate toward a female candidate. And that was true for women over 45,\u201d says Sanchez. \u201cDemocratic women under 45 voted on personality and policy, not gender.\u201d\n\nSanchez did research across the aisle for her 2009 book, You\u2019ve Come a Long Way, Maybe. Her advice for Fiorina, who\u2019s used to being in business circles and the only woman in the room, is to remember the ladies. \u201cI don\u2019t see her talking to conservative women although they have evangelized around her. There are so many woman entrepreneurs she can talk to.\u201d As for Clinton, keep riding the Girl Power movement, as this piece of history has been a long time coming.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:49.501+0000"}

She grew up learning that hospitality is key in that business. That\u2019s why she is a leading voice, along with many other business owners, chefs and CEOs, in the fight against Arkansas\u2019s Religious Freedom Act, which Republican Governor Asa Hutchinson sent back to the legislature on Wednesday to make changes so the bill mirrors federal law.\n\n\u201cLocal independent restaurants all realized early on that we create hospitality for everyone,\u201d Peck said. \u201cWe serve and treat everyone whether they are our employees or customers like they are guests in our home. This bill strikes at the very nerve of what our business is about.\u201d\n\nThis week, Leo\u2019s Greek Castle, a restaurant in Little Rock\u2019s artsy Hillcrest neighborhood, posted on their Facebook page: \u201cIf House Bill 1228 isn\u2019t vetoed, we will exercise our newfound right to refuse service to bigots, homophobes, and racists.\u201d\n\nDave and Ray\u2019s Downtown Diner near the state capitol posted a sign in its restaurant that quoted Mark 12:31: \u201cLove thy neighbor as thyself\u2026\u201d and added, \u201cWe do not discriminate. All are welcome!\u201d\n\nThe controversy around the bill, which is similar to Indiana\u2019s, has left many Arkansans exasperated and angry, and some have called it a modern-day Civil War. As Hutchinson said in his news conference on Wednesday, \u201cIt has divided families and there is clearly a generational gap. My son Seth signed the petition asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill. It shows that there is a generational difference on these opinions.\u201d\n\nHis nephew, Jeremy Hutchinson, a Republican state senator and the governor\u2019s nephew, voted against the bill last week. He was the only Republican in the Senate to do so.\n\nJanine Parry, a political science professor at the University of Arkansas at Fayetteville and Arkansas Poll director, said that Hutchinson is right.\n\n\u201cThis is definitely generational,\u201d Parry said. \u201cData in Arkansas look much like nationwide samples: the younger people are, the more supportive they are of gay rights.\u201d\n\nStill, regardless of a generational shift, in the Bible Belt, homosexuality can have major consequences.\n\n\u201cArkansas LGBTQ youth face a multitude of risks, from hostile home environments to schools where the bully is often school personnel,\u201d said Kat Crisp, interim director of the Center for Artistic Revolution, the state\u2019s oldest LGBTQ-centric organization and the only drop-in center for LGBTQ youth. \u201cThe bullying that LGBTQ youth endure does not stop when they graduate from high school, as they go out into a world where it is legal to refuse to employ and fire them, refuse housing and access to public accommodations. A law like HB1228 emboldens those who would like to use their religious preferences to discriminate against LGBTQ Arkansans.\u201d\n\nHarold Hughes, a gay activist, said he has been told that he is going to hell because he has lobbied for LGBTQ people to be included in church. He said just a couple of years ago activists had to assist a lesbian couple after they were pulled over for a routine traffic stop. One woman was jailed on \u201ca trumped-up, resisting-arrest charge,\u201d Hughes said.\n\n\u201cThe police housed her with male prisoners,\u201d he said.\n\nJoining the small-business rebellion in urban Little Rock, corporations such as Acxiom and Walmart, chambers of commerce and mayors have also urged Hutchinson to consider the possible economic fallout from such a bill. Numerous protests in recent days throughout the state have called on Hutchinson to veto the bill.\n\nHowever, in Arkansas, it only takes a simple majority in both legislative chambers to override the veto. Both are controlled by Republicans. It is unlikely that legislators from Hutchinson\u2019s own party would have voted to override him, but anything is possible, said Jay Barth, a political science professor at Hendrix College.\n\n\u201cIn Arkansas, the veto power is formally a very weak one with only a simple majority of each house needed to overturn it,\u201d Barth said. \u201cHowever, Arkansas governors in the modern era have rarely been overturned by legislatures controlled by their party.\u201d\n\nSeveral Republican legislators attended Hutchinson\u2019s news conference on Wednesday. Barth said that\u2019s a good sign toward an amended bill.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the visibility of the legislative leaders this morning was so important as the governor attempts to develop a legislative fix,\u201d Barth said.\n\nThat fix, however, has a long way to go. A vote to recall the bill must pass both legislative chambers. If a recall fails, Hutchinson would have five days to veto it. If he does nothing, it will become law. If he vetoes it, the legislature has 30 days to override the veto, and that could happen when the legislature returns for one day in May to tidy up loose ends. The legislature could adjourn this week.\n\nWhile some Democrats praised Hutchinson on Wednesday for seeking balance, others have little trust in him.\n\n\u201cGovernor Hutchinson has shown a lack of trust with Arkansans when it comes to this bill,\u201d Candace Martin, executive director of the Democratic Party of Arkansas, said. \u201cFirst, he said he would sign it into law and that it didn\u2019t promote discrimination, even though it did. Now, he\u2019s asked for clarification with amendments but didn\u2019t specify what amendments he would like to see made. His lack of courage on this bill has given Arkansas families and business leaders reason to doubt his leadership when it comes to laws that promote discrimination.\u201d\n\nActivists aren\u2019t giving up. Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign and a native Arkansan, spoke on the capitol steps after Hutchinson\u2019s press conference.\n\n\u201cWe have to double down on our efforts and hold them accountable. \u2026 You have to continue to speak out,\u201d Griffin told hundreds of people who attended the afternoon event. \u201cAt the end of the day we will win this battle, but it is a long road ahead.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:49.772+0000"}
{"entityId": 1990, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Kentucky Senator Rand Paul announced his candidacy for presidency on Tuesday. Will his unconventional appeal be enough to overcome traditional GOP powers?\n\nSen. Rand Paul has officially announced he\u2019s running for president. But can a libertarian-leaning candidate win the Republican nomination and ultimately the presidency?\n\nIn a political world dominated by the liberal-conservative divide, there are many doubters. But there\u2019s growing evidence that Paul can broaden the Republican base and appeal to the broad center of the electorate.\n\nThe Republican base may be divided into establishment, tea party, Christian right, and libertarian wings. Paul starts out with a strong base in the libertarian wing, which gave his father, Representative Ron Paul, 21 percent of the Iowa Caucus vote and 23 percent of the New Hampshire Primary in 2012. With his strong opposition to taxes and spending and his book, The Tea Party Goes to Washington, he\u2019s also well positioned for the tea party vote. His opposition to abortion rights will make him acceptable to religious conservatives as the field narrows.\n\nThe wild card may be who can attract voters who don\u2019t usually vote in Republican primaries. Paul\u2019s stands on military intervention, marijuana, criminal justice reform, and the surveillance state give him a good shot at getting independents and young people to come out for him.\n\nThe race could come down to former Florida governor Jeb Bush as the establishment candidate against the last standing insurgent candidate, and Paul is, as pundit Peter Beinart wrote recently, \u201cas bold as any reformist in the race.\u201d\n\nPolitical observers usually talk about liberals, conservatives, and moderates. But not all voters fit into those boxes. Every year Gallup divides the public into liberal, conservative, libertarian, and populist. In the 2014 survey the firm classified 27 percent of respondents as conservative and 24 percent as libertarian. Paul has the libertarian field all to himself.\n\nIndeed, a 2006 Zogby poll for the Cato Institute asked respondents, \u201cWould you describe yourself as fiscally conservative and socially liberal?\u201d Fully 59 percent said yes, and only 27 percent said no. That\u2019s a huge untapped market for a candidate who can cut across red-blue barriers.\n\nEvents of the past few years have pushed voters in a libertarian direction, causing some observers to talk about a \u201clibertarian moment\u201d in American politics. The financial crisis, the Wall Street bailouts, the $18 trillion national debt, and Obamacare created the tea party. The revelations about spying and surveillance since 2013 have caused grave concerns about privacy. Less traumatically, growing support for gay marriage and marijuana legalization shows the strength of libertarian attitudes in a country founded on the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\n\nThe small band of neoconservatives who dominate conservative punditry have tried to ignore or dismiss Paul\u2019s chances on the grounds that his mildly non-interventionist foreign policy will make him unacceptable to Republican voters. They need to read more polls. Last June 75 percent of Americans, and 63 percent of Republicans, told CBS News/New York Times pollsters that the Iraq war wasn\u2019t worth the costs. Seventy percent of Republicans opposed military action in Syria. A massive Pew Research Center survey in December 2013 found that 52 percent of respondents, the highest number ever, said the United States \u201cshould mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own.\u201d\n\nHe yields to no other candidate in his opposition to taxes, spending, debt, regulation, and Obamacare. But he also talks to Silicon Valley about government spying, and African-American audiences about racial bias in the drug war, and college students about both.\n\nThe brutal rise of the Islamic State has made many Americans, including more Republicans, more hawkish. But nine months from now, when Republicans start voting in Iowa and New Hampshire, they\u2019re likely to be tired of endless wars and to notice that 15 years of military intervention under President Bush, President Obama, and Secretary of State Clinton have left the Middle East in chaos. As the only skeptic about promiscuous intervention running in the GOP primaries, Paul has a chance to gain support from the war-weary.\n\nRand Paul is trying something different in a Republican presidential race. He yields to no other candidate in his opposition to taxes, spending, debt, regulation, and Obamacare.

But when it comes to Hopes and Dreams and Everyday Americans, she sounds like latter-day Bruce Springsteen.\n\nOn his 2009 album Working on a Dream he sang of the \u201cQueen of the Supermarket\u201d who bags his groceries amid the \u201caisles and aisles of dreams.\u201d You get the feeling, listening to the song, that Springsteen, however noble his intention to pay tribute to the average worker, has probably not set foot in a supermarket in a very, very long time.\n\nLikewise Clinton uneasily meditated on the plight of \u201cthe single mom\u201d but it wasn\u2019t clear if this was one particular mom or a composite of many moms or just the proverbial single mom, or \u201cthe grandmother\u201d who provides child care but can\u2019t live on her paycheck, or \u201cthe young entrepreneur\u201d who wants to buy a bowling alley, or the \u201cmillions of hardworking Americans [who] tell similar stories.\u201d\n\nIn preparation for today\u2019s speech, Clinton and her aides reportedly spent months consulting with over 200 domestic policy advisers, including Neera Tanden, an adviser for her 2008 White House bid, and two former Obama Administration aides: Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein.\n\nStanding in front of 12 American flags at a Hillaryclinton.com-stamped lectern, Clinton spent 45 minutes making a series of ambitious policy promises to the packed West Village auditorium: higher incomes for the middle class through a change to the tax code to incentivize companies to \u201cshare profits with their employees\u201d; the appointment of harsher bank regulators; \u201cbreaking down barriers\u201d to get more Americans\u2014\u201cespecially women\u201d\u2014into the workforce; increased investment in clean renewable energy; \u201ccomprehensive immigration reform\u201d; and the reining in of \u201cexcessive risks on Wall Street.\u201d\n\nClinton uneasily meditated on the plight of \u201cthe single mom\u201d who she talked to, but it wasn\u2019t clear if this was one particular mom or a composite of many moms or just a proverbial single mom.\n\nClinton\u2019s economic philosophy is preventive rather than prescriptive.\n\nShe criticized short-term fixes for financial woes and decried a business environment which emphasizes end-of-quarter numbers rather than overall health.\n\nClinton focused her fire at the Republican field, hitting Marco Rubio, Scott Walker, and Jeb Bush by name, and tearing into trickle-down policies which, she claimed, have consistently led to disasters that Democrats, including her husband, have been forced to bail the country out of. Her Democratic rivals went unacknowledged, but traces of their influence were everywhere.\n\nShe borrowed the Howard Beale rallying cries of Elizabeth Warren and her left-wing primary rival Bernie Sanders, but adapted them to fit her tamer message. (In May, when The New Yorker asked Warren if Clinton was co-opting her message, Warren responded, \u201cEh.\u201d)\n\nWhereas Warren declares \u201cthe game rigged,\u201d Clinton said (as she has since her April announcement) that families feel \u201cthe deck is stacked.\u201d\n\nAnd the Sanders line, \u201cIf a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist,\u201d was edited to say the regulators she appoints will \u201cunderstand that too big to fail is still too big a problem.\u201d\n\nWarren and Sanders have called for jail time for big bank CEOs who helped cause the financial crisis. Clinton tiptoed up to that line and then ran away scared.\n\n\u201cWhile institutions have paid large fines and, in some cases, admitted guilt,\u201d Clinton said, \u201ctoo often it has seemed that the human beings responsible get off with limited consequences or none at all, even when they\u2019ve already pocketed the gains.\u201d She continued, \u201cThis is wrong, and on my watch it will change.\u201d How? She didn\u2019t say, instead promising, as another Democratic Martin O\u2019Malley did last week, that she would \u201crein in\u201d Wall Street. \u201cOver the course of this campaign,\u201d she said, \u201cI will offer plans to rein in excessive risks on Wall Street and ensure that stock markets work for everyday investors, not just high-frequency traders and those with the best or fastest connections.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:50.766+0000"}
{"entityId": 1992, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yes, it\u2019s true: If Obama can toughen the penalties for cheating and pivot to confronting Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, he will enhance Israel\u2019s security.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believes the Iran nuclear deal is a \u201cstunning historical mistake.\u201d Meanwhile, Israel\u2019s opposition Labor Party, Republicans here at home, and much of the American Jewish community are joining him in denouncing the agreement signed last week.\n\nBut many former senior intelligence and national security officials in Israel disagree. While they think the deal is flawed and that Netanyahu deserves credit for raising the alarm on Iran years ago, they also believe that the historic agreement is\u2014on balance\u2014in the national security interest of the State of Israel.\n\nI spoke recently with Ami Ayalon, a former head of Shin Bet, the Israeli internal security service, and a former chief of the Israeli Navy. Even as he explained that the issue \u201cis not black and white,\u201d he reeled off a list of former defense ministers and chiefs of Shin Bet and Mossad who agree with him that \u201cwhen it comes to Iran's nuclear capability, this [deal] is the best option.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen negotiations began, Iran was two months away from acquiring enough material for a [nuclear] bomb. Now it will be 12 months,\u201d Ayalon says, and the difference is significant to anyone with a background in intelligence. \u201cIsraelis are failing to distinguish between reducing Iran\u2019s nuclear capability and Iran being the biggest devil in the Middle East,\u201d he says.\n\nWhy has the response been more emotional than logical? \u201cIt\u2019s very easy to play with fears in a fearful society,\u201d he says.\n\nFor a country that usually has a sure sense of its own security interests, Israel can be strangely obtuse about the true existential threats it faces. Many Israelis and American Jews resent Jimmy Carter for his strong views opposing the occupation of Palestinian territories and his use of the word \u201capartheid\u201d to describe the situation there. They rarely recognize that by engineering the Camp David Accords, Carter removed the existential threat posed by the Egyptian army, the only force capable of driving Israel into the sea.\n\nNow they dislike President Obama for striking a deal that, at a minimum, delays Iran\u2019s ability to destroy Israel with a nuclear bomb.\n\nAyalon and several of the other Israeli war heroes who appeared in The Gatekeepers, an acclaimed 2012 documentary about Shin Bet, endorse Obama\u2019s best argument for the agreement\u2014that the alternative is much worse.\n\nJust imagine what would happen if Congress overrides Obama\u2019s veto and kills the deal. No one seriously disputes that the sanctions regime would quickly collapse; Russia is already planning its new business deals with Iran and the Europeans aren\u2019t far behind. The idea that a tougher United States could by itself force better terms is a dangerous fantasy. With rejection, we would get the worst of both worlds. Iran would have much of its oil money back, but without the most intrusive inspections in history (24/7 monitoring of its nuclear facilities), 98 percent reductions in uranium stockpiles, and the many other provisions that sharply reduce its existential threat to Israel.\n\nAt that point, Iran--freed of an international coalition arrayed against it, and led by Tehran hard-liners empowered by the American decision--would have no reason not to race to a bomb.\n\nThen we would risk a war full of unintended consequences that would be blamed by the world on the U.S. Congress buckling to Israeli pressure. And it wouldn't go well. Ayalon cites Israeli intelligence estimates that U.S. bunker-buster bombs would at best set back Iran\u2019s nuclear program by two to four years, or roughly a fifth as long as required by the terms of the new deal. And that\u2019s assuming a war-weary United States would even fight.\n\nAyalon and his colleagues believe the best way for Obama to reassure Israel and help sell the agreement at home is to ramp up his rhetoric.\n\nBut even with a deal, the U.S. needs to make it seem as if we would. Ayalon and his colleagues believe the best way for Obama to reassure Israel and help sell the agreement at home is to ramp up his rhetoric. They fault him for not spelling out more serious consequences for when (not if) Iran cheats, and for when the deal expires. Obama \u201cdoesn't have the right combination of the language of peace and the language of war,\u201d Ayalon told me. \u201cHe has to make it very clear that while he believes in diplomacy, he also knows how to use force.\u201d\n\nSound advice. Before long, the president should assert that violations of the agreement would bring not just \u201csnap-back\u201d sanctions but military action. In his weekly radio address on Saturday, he said that despite the deal expiring in 10 to 15 years, U.S. policy preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon is \u201cpermanent.\u201d That\u2019s a start.\n\nIn the meantime, the superiority of diplomacy to war may be best understood in the case of the Arak heavy water reactor, which produces the deadly plutonium most easily used to build nuclear weapons. Under the deal, Arak\u2019s plutonium threat is ended, an achievement that has been strangely downplayed this week. At the same time, the huge underground nuclear installation at Fordow will be much more effectively neutered by a corps of IAEA inspectors with unfettered access than by bombs that might have trouble penetrating the solid rock above it.\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s arguments against the deal, meanwhile, are getting pathetic. Last week, he latched onto the 24 days Iran can delay before allowing inspectors into its ostensibly non-nuclear military facilities. This is like giving a drug dealer 24 days to get rid of his stash, the prime minister said. Iran could just \u201cflush the meth down the toilet.\u201d\n\nWhat a perfect example of the level of debate in the U.S. and Israel, where a catchy sound bite substitutes for basic science and common sense. With the half-life of uranium-235 at 703.8 million years, 24 days is a nanosecond. Soil samples gathered by inspectors would quickly identify the presence of fissile material. As Obama drily pointed out, \u201cThis is not something you hide in a closet, put on a dolly and move somewhere.\u201d\n\nObama was right to be annoyed that Netanyahu and so many Israeli and American critics denounced the agreement before reading it. Compare that to 1978, when Jimmy Carter signed a hugely unpopular treaty turning over the Panama Canal to the Panamanians. Carter\u2019s White House privately asked all 100 senators to pledge to hold their fire until they were briefed on the details by the State Department. Ninety-nine of them (everyone except Jesse Helms) agreed. That was when the Senate actually was a \u201cdeliberative body\u201d instead of a television studio.\n\nAs the balance of power in the Middle East shifts more toward Iran, Obama is making it clear that Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf states will all get \u201cunprecedented\u201d security assurances from the U.S. (He has already provided record amounts of military aid to Israel, which Israelis and some American Jews rarely credit.)\n\nMore important, Obama has in recent days repeatedly mentioned troublesome Iranian arms shipments and support for terrorist organizations. Until now, Iranian proxy wars have been a third-tier presidential issue. Now they will move to the top of Washington\u2019s foreign policy agenda, with Republicans frustrated by the nuclear deal likely to pound away on these threats to Israel\u2019s security, thereby helping Israel confront them over time.\n\nAyalon and other Israeli intelligence experts believe it\u2019s inevitable that Iran will test Obama or his successor\u2019s resolve, likely by dragging its feet with the help of the complex dispute resolution process spelled out in the appendix of the deal.\n\nBy my reading of the appendix, the weakest sections involve the specifics of how the newly created Joint Commission will litigate claims. While majority rule on the Commission means that the U.S. and its European allies don't need Russia and China to enforce inspections, the complicated appeals system that includes vague \u201cadvisory groups\u201d is a feast for Iranian lawyers.\n\nObama must avoid the situation President Clinton faced in the 1990s, when North Korea cheated gradually on a nuclear deal and built a bomb without significant impediments. He\u2019ll need to identify and publicize every Iranian delay or lack of cooperation and spell out the consequences.\n\nOn Iran\u2019s regional misbehavior, Obama should now pivot to a much tougher policy of interdicting Iranian arms shipments, which would enhance Israel\u2019s security even if Tehran now has lots more money for mischief. An international peace conference on the future of Syria proposed by Russian President Putin\u2014now being considered by the U.S.\u2014would offer another chance for checking Iran, which is the primary backer of Bashir Assad\u2019s murderous regime. Any future cooperation with Iran on battling ISIS, which is inching closer to the Jewish State\u2019s borders, is also in Israel\u2019s interest.\n\nFor six years, Barack Obama has been cautious about calling out Iran. To convince China and Russia not to veto sanctions in the Security Council, he spoke softly. Harsh condemnations might have complicated the nuclear deal, which was rightly his first priority. The same went for pushing too hard on Iran\u2019s outrageous imprisonment of four innocent Americans.\n\nNow the president will have a much freer hand to confront Iran on its non-nuclear behavior, and has more political incentive to do so. Like the deal itself, that\u2019s good for the world in general, and Israel in particular.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:50.927+0000"}

She also shared that the feeling is mutual, noting that at the Glamour Women of the Year Awards Clinton told Schumer she related to one of Schumer\u2019s jokes. The joke in question? \u201cI said that in L.A. my arms register as legs, and she really liked that. She was like, \u2018I can relate,\u2019\u201d Schumer recalled.\n\nBut Schumer and Clinton actually have more in common than their sense of humor about the absurd physical expectations society places on women, particularly women in their chosen professions. For starters, they are both feminists whose political leanings have guided their work. But it is the differences in their approaches\u2014and how they are perceived by the public\u2014that may tell us more about Hillary\u2019s chances for winning the White House in 2016 than yet another poll. (Although we will get to the latest polls in a second.)\n\nWhen people think of Hillary Clinton, a lot of words come to mind. Polarizing is one of them. But even her detractors will acknowledge she\u2019s also smart, resilient, and tough. They\u2019ve thrown the kitchen sink at her over the years and she\u2019s still standing.\n\nHowever, even her admirers would acknowledge she\u2019s not what voters would call accessible. There\u2019s always a bit of a wall there. (Having that kitchen sink thrown at her may have something to do with that.) And even more damaging is the perception that she is not authentic. A growing number of voters find her dishonest, according to the latest Quinnipiac poll.\n\nSchumerhas been incredibly blunt about how trying it can be to be a woman in a man\u2019s world, but men are too busy laughing with her to resent her for calling out the patriarchy.\n\nSmart + inaccessible + inauthentic does not usually equal someone who can easily win a presidential race. Just look at Al Gore and Mitt Romney.\n\nAdd to that equation the fact that she\u2019s a woman and the climb is even tougher because, as unfair as it is, we all know women are judged by different standards. It is never enough to just be smart or talented or tough; we\u2019re also supposed to be attractive and likable at the same time. (Before anyone starts typing an angry tweet or comment dismissing the notion that women candidates are judged differently, ask yourself honestly what would happen if a female candidate stopped wearing makeup on the campaign trail and wore the same suit every day, something Clinton recently touched upon.)\n\nThis is what makes Schumer\u2019s ascent both fascinating and potentially instructive for Clinton, someone who Schumer has said she plans to campaign for.\n\nStandup comedy is not exactly known for being an easy place for women and very few female standup comics have truly cracked the boys club to become household names. Even fewer have managed to earn serious respect within the uber-male, uber-macho comic community. But Schumer\u2019s done it. She\u2019s managed to become a breakout star with as many male fans as female ones, and she\u2019s done it without compromising her feminist zeal. There wasn\u2019t a doubt in my mind Schumer was both smart and a feminist the first time I read one of her jokes. But I also realized the reason she would be a huge success is because:\n\nA) Even her comments about feminist issues, like women\u2019s body image, were ones men could laugh at.\n\nB) Even when a joke didn\u2019t really land, you could tell Schumer told it because she thought it was funny\u2014not because she spent hours calculating where that joke would land her career-wise.\n\nC) She would tell you the truth about how she saw things\u2014even if it were supremely uncomfortable for all involved, including her, the subject, or the audience.\n\nD) You can genuinely tell she has a sense of humor about it all\u2014including some of the unfair nonsense she knows she will have to put up with that a male comedian won\u2019t.\n\nPart of Clinton\u2019s problem is that she struggles with all of the above. Having met her more than once I know she has a great laugh\u2014but I doubt many Americans believe she has a great sense of humor, and that comes across.\n\nThere\u2019s this sense that the weariness of the last two decades on the national stage has robbed her of her sense of enthusiasm for the process altogether, and possibly stoked a resentment for it. I can\u2019t say I blame her. Unlike Hillary, I have a tough time hiding my disdain for stupidity, prying questions, and people I don\u2019t like. These are among the many reasons I would never run for office.\n\nBut Clinton is running, so that means she\u2019s going to have to find a way to see the humor in it all. From the stupid comments some commentator (likely male) will probably make about her appearance down the road, to the stupid question someone will ask her in a debate that he would never ask a man. Schumer has been incredibly blunt about how trying it can be to be a woman in a man\u2019s world, but men are too busy laughing with her to resent her for calling out the patriarchy.\n\nA big part of Schumer\u2019s effectiveness is that whatever she says, it\u2019s clear she says it because she either really believes it or really believes it is funny. Consider this: When Schumer faced her first round of negative publicity, specifically the criticism she faced for making racially insensitive jokes in the past, she did what few are willing to do in the age of Twitter outrage: she defended herself. That further enraged some people, but it also impressed others, me being one of them.\n\nThough she eventually came around to saying she had evolved past the jokes in question, whether you liked them or not, they reinforced a fundamental perception about her: If she thinks it\u2019s funny she\u2019ll say it out loud. You may not always love a person like that, but you also know you can trust her.\n\nThis week a thirty-something, white, female pro-choice friend mentioned to me she finds Clinton untrustworthy. She doesn\u2019t dislike her. But just doesn\u2019t trust her. When I pressed her on why, she mentioned the private email server, but fundamentally it wasn\u2019t about that. You either believe someone will tell you the truth, and show you who they really are, or you don\u2019t.\n\nIn her GQ interview Schumer said, \u201cI love being in my own skin\u201d and professed she wants others to feel comfortable in theirs.\n\nFor Clinton to win the presidency she\u2019s going to have to show Americans that she\u2019s not only smart, resilient, and tough, but comfortable in her own skin.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:51.274+0000"}

I give him credit for seeing things that others might not, but\u2014despite the optimistic headline: \u201cMike Huckabee Would Be a More Important Candidate Than You Might Think,\u201d he actually underestimates Huck\u2019s potential as a disruptive factor in this campaign.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear what\u2019s in the water in Hope, Arkansas, but that Bill Clinton and Huck are both from the same hamlet is nothing short of miraculous. Put aside the snake oil salesman stuff, and the numerous ridiculous things Huckabee has said to get attention, and you\u2019re left with a man who is essentially the love child of Clinton and Ronald Reagan. I recently argued that only the great politicians like The Gipper and Bubba can oscillate between indignation and compassion. Well, guess what: Huckabee can do both, too. This is a guy who\u2019s so compelling he actually got Jon Stewart to question his own abortion stance.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a conservative; I\u2019m just not mad about it,\u201d he often quips. Except he can be mad about it\u2014or feign anger, at least. So he can play the reasonable conservative or he can hurl red meat. As they say in football, he can play both sides of the ball. In 2008, Huckabee came out of nowhere to wow us in the debates. The competition will be stiffer this time around, but he can do it again.\n\nThe fact that Huckabee is a good communicator\u2014and that he can appeal to evangelical Christians, a hugely important constituency in Iowa\u2014is not exactly the most novel observation. But I think there are two additional things Huckabee has going for him that are not as widely appreciated.\n\nThe first is that he spent the last several years as a Fox News host. Now, let\u2019s be honest: It\u2019s unlikely that many people reading this have ever watched Huckabee\u2019s Saturday night show\u2014except to see if he was going to announce for president (or for purely ironic purposes). And I\u2019m not even suggesting you were watching Girls instead. A lot of us who watch Fox shows like Special Report wouldn\u2019t think to turn on Huckabee.\n\nBut millions of Americans did watch his show\u2014and guess what? Many of these same Americans will vote in Republican primaries. I think we probably underestimate the impact of hosting a weekly show on Fox News.\n\nLastly, though, I think there is a huge underserved constituency in the GOP\u2014and that constituency is what might best be termed populist conservatives. These folks tend to be white and working-class and who feel they\u2019ve been left behind in America. They are culturally conservative\u2014but they also want to keep government out of their Medicare.\n\nMitt Romney was arguably the worst candidate Republicans could have ever nominated to appeal to this constituency. But while candidates like Huckabee and Rick Santorum flirted with going full populist, something always seemed to keep them from really doubling down on it.\n\nThere are tons of Americans out there listening to country radio, clinging to God and guns\u2026and government.\n\nOne can only assume this is because there is a ceiling on how much populist demagoguery one is permitted to dole out\u2014and still remain a Republican in good standing. There\u2019s a fine line between attacking the \u201cfat cats\u201d and engaging in class warfare, and one doesn\u2019t want to get on the wrong side of that line. But having cashed in, and now finding himself in his post-radio, and possibly post-TV phase, Huckabee might well decide it\u2019s time to throw caution to the wind.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong: As a free market conservative, this brand of populism isn\u2019t my cup of tea. Nor do I think Huckabee can win the nomination. He\u2019s always lacked money and organization, and that won\u2019t change. But as a political observer, I can\u2019t help but suspect that there is a huge opening for a conservative candidate willing to be the working man\u2019s conservative.\n\nThe last time someone really tried this was when \u201cPitchfork\u201d Pat Buchanan, and then Ross Perot, ran in 1992. It resonated then, but that was before the \u201cgiant sucking sound\u201d really kicked in. Whether it\u2019s globalization or immigration\u2014or whatever \u201c-ation\u201d might have taken your job\u2014it stands to reason that the same grassroots phenomenon that helped Buchanan and Perot tap into an underserved constituency might be even more potent today.\n\nAlready known as a tax-and-spender, Mike Huckabee isn\u2019t soon going to win over Steve Forbes or Larry Kudlow or The Club for Growth, so why try? There are tons of Americans out there listening to country radio, clinging to God and guns\u2026and government.\n\nThe other day, when New Jersey Governor Chris Christie proposed some fairly modest reforms to save social security (means testing and raising the retirement age to 69), ostensibly conservative readers weighed in against it on the Facebook page of the Daily Caller, where I work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m entitled to social security because it\u2019s MY money that I have given to the govt since I was 16 years old with the PROMISE I would get it back when I was older. FU Christie.\u201d Yes, this is anecdotal\u2014but this comment was also representative of a lot of comments on that particular post. A lot of conservatives appear to believe there is some lockbox where \u201ctheir\u201d money is being saved for their retirement.\n\nA few days later came this headline from the Weekly Standard: \u201cHuckabee Bashes Republican Plans to Reform Medicare and Social Security.\u201d As Huckabee himself told The Daily Beast over the weekend, \u201cI\u2019m getting slammed by some in the GOP ruling class for thinking it wrong to involuntarily take money from people\u2019s paychecks for 50 years and then not keep the promise government made.\u201d\n\nSome of the same underlying trends behind the excitement over Elizabeth Warren are present, if dormant, on the right. So how can Huckabee break away from the pack? Most free market conservatives I know agree that \u201ccrony capitalism\u201d is a problem. This has become boilerplate language you can expect from everyone from Marco Rubio to Ted Cruz, and it\u2019s a kind of flirting with populism.\n\nBut Huckabee appears poised to do what no other Republican will have the ability or the inclination to do\u2014and that is to go full populist in a way that acknowledges the fact that a lot of folks need the government\u2019s help, that resents the fact that the game has been rigged by the rich and the corporations, yet still embraces a culturally conservative lifestyle. This will provoke serious pushback from the libertarian and pro-business wings of the conservative coalition. But if he does it\u2014if he sticks to it\u2014out there in the hinterland, there\u2019ll be a market for it.\n\nGet your pitchforks ready.\n\nEditor's note: Matt Lewis's wife previously consulted for Ted Cruz's senate campaign, and currently consults for RickPAC, the leadership PAC affiliated with Rick Perry.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:51.421+0000"}

Take California agribusiness, which contributes mightily to Republicans in the state. The industry generates more than $45 billion annually in revenue, and it would shrivel up like a raisin in the sun without illegal immigrants.\n\nIndeed, a big reason that the nation\u2019s most populous state is home to an estimated 2.5 million illegal immigrants is because it\u2019s also home to countless farmers, ranchers, restaurateurs, hoteliers, construction firms, small-businessmen, and homeowners who rely on illegal immigrant labor for their slice of the California Dream. This game is all about supply and demand, and you never hear those tough-talking Republicans say anything about cracking down on the demand side.\n\nMeanwhile, California Democrats want a gigantic expansion of rights, benefits and protections for the undocumented.\n\nTheir message is \u201cbienvenidos.\u201d In their language, that translates to: \u201cWelcome to California. Stay a while. You\u2019re just as good as anyone born in this country, and so we\u2019re going to give you the same rights and privileges they have. We can\u2019t give you legal status or a green card. But we can give you a lot of other things to make your stay more comfortable.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference in Sacramento, a group of Democratic legislators\u2014switching back and forth between English and Spanish\u2014recently unveiled a package of 10 bills that would, among other things: create an Office of New Americans in the governor\u2019s office to better serve the undocumented; provide illegal immigrants with subsidized health care by extending Medi-Cal coverage to all Californians, regardless of immigration status; limit use of \u201cE-Verify\u201d (the government-run database that employers use to check if prospective hires are legally eligible to work) and prevent \u201cabuse\u201d by employers; and ban businesses from discriminating against residents based on their immigration status, citizenship, or language.\n\nThe health care provision is the most expensive item on the menu, with a tab that was originally set at $1.3 billion.\n\nThat last one is a beauty. If it extends to hiring, it flies in the face of federal law, namely the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act that made it a federal crime to knowingly hire an illegal immigrant. Now California wants to make it a state crime to not hire one? Employers can now pick their poison: They can violate one law or the other.\n\nI question the motivation for this outburst of legislative generosity. And I have a theory as to why they are doing this now.\n\nFor the last few years, President Obama was deporting an average of 400,000 illegal immigrants every 12 months and unlawfully detaining thousands of women and children from Central America in horrendous conditions. Meanwhile, the Democratic members of the California legislature\u2014even the Latino Caucus\u2014were saying nada about it, and I\u2019ve wondered how they were going to work through their guilt and atone for this dereliction of duty.\n\nNow, with the California Democrats\u2019 grab bag of giveaways, freebies and protections, we have the answer.\n\nThere is some good in this hash, but you have to go digging for it. One of the bills proposed would protect immigrants from attorneys and consultants who prey on them and demand advance payment for services. It would also require that the clients of these practitioners be given a toll-free number so that, in case of fraud, they can report them to the State Bar of California. Both of these proposals should be welcomed.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s plenty of bad to go along with the good, and the pushback seems to have caught Democrats flat-footed. Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Le\u00f3n (D-Los Angeles), said the avalanche of bills\u2014which serves as a dramatic affront to nativists and other immigration restrictionists\u2014\u201cunequivocally state California\u2019s commitment to immigrants.\u201d And de Le\u00f3n says doesn\u2019t understand why anyone would object to what he and other Democrats are trying to ram through.\n\n\u201cWhat is it that we fear in opening our arms to the millions already here?\u201d he asked.\n\nWell, the cost for one thing. The health care provision is the most expensive item on the menu, with a tab that was originally set at $1.3 billion. Yet no one will say where the money is supposed to come from in cash-strapped California.\n\nAnd aside from the price tag, let me tell you what bothers me about this Bill of Rights for illegal immigrants.\n\nIt\u2019s not the feeble arguments offered by conservative pundits, columnists, and radio hosts. Liberals don\u2019t understand much about the immigration debate, but they look like geniuses next to conservatives who understand less.\n\nMost of what they\u2019re saying on the right is rubbish. These bills are not intended to lure illegal immigrants to California; we already do that with jobs. They do not signal that Democrats want an open border; the union members who control the Democratic Party oppose that, which could explain why, far from advocating for an open border, Democrats in Congress keep voting to fortify the border.\n\nAnd finally, it is not true that illegal immigrants pay no taxes; they pay sales, payroll, and property taxes whether they own or rent. In fact, some even pay federal income taxes because Uncle Sam was kind enough to create an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number to allow those who lack Social Security numbers to dread April 15 like the rest of us.\n\nSo what bothers me about these types of bills? Two things.\n\nFirst, the undocumented never asked for these things. I\u2019ve interviewed dozens of illegal immigrants over the years, and they always say they want three things and only three things from this country\u2014a work permit, a driver\u2019s license, and the ability to travel back and forth across borders to visit the families they left behind. The rest is just window dressing whipped up by politicians to serve their agendas, not those of immigrants.\n\nSecond, these kinds of legislative giveaways serve to legitimize unlawful behavior. It\u2019s still a crime\u2014correction, a civil infraction\u2014to enter the United States illegally or overstay a visa and we shouldn\u2019t be embarrassed about saying so. Every time we chip away at the infraction of trampling our borders\u2014whether it\u2019s by pressuring media companies to stop using the phrase \u201cillegal immigrant,\u201d or showering the undocumented with things they didn\u2019t even ask for, we make it more socially acceptable to be an illegal immigrant.\n\nHow is that in the national interest? And what incentive does it provide others to come to this country legally? For that matter, what incentive does it give the undocumented to attempt to change their status if there ever is anything resembling comprehensive immigration reform? Why bother if, thanks to well-intentioned but misguided Democratic legislators in California, you\u2019re already comfortable the way you are?\n\nThese questions deserve answers that the politicians who run this state won\u2019t provide. That\u2019s unacceptable, and it should spell the end of California\u2019s great immigrant giveaway.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:51.576+0000"}

In the second quarter this year he had raised just $1.14 million. By July 15, he had a paltry $883,913 in cash on hand. The campaign of fellow Texan Ted Cruz, by contrast, raised $14 million in the same period.\n\nNear bankruptcy used to mean something for a candidate. An old clich\u00e9 in politics is that campaigns don\u2019t end, they run out of money. By this point in previous presidential cycles it was typical to see a winnowing of the field, as poorly funded candidates realized fumes wouldn\u2019t be enough to keep them chugging along. In August 2011, for instance, former Minnesota governor Tim Pawlenty, who had raised more than $4 million in the second quarter, dropped out of the race after spending his campaign into debt.\n\nThings are different now. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision did not immediately usher in an entirely new way of campaigning. In 2012, super PACs\u2019 main function was to lob attack ads at the opposition. But to hear critics of the decision tell it, that was never going to last. The role of super PACs in presidential elections was inevitably going to mature into something more central and less transparent.\n\nAnd if Perry\u2019s campaign is any indication, that\u2019s exactly what has happened.\n\n\u201cThe court said, \u2018We\u2019re gonna allow a flood of unlimited money into our elections, but don\u2019t worry, America, the money will be independent of candidates so it can\u2019t corrupt them,\u2019\u201d said Paul Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center. \u201cFive years later\u2014predictably, in my view\u2014it\u2019s not at all independent.\u201d\n\nSuper PACs have brought Perry back to life. In the wake of the governor\u2019s campaign pay freeze, NBC News reported that the candidate\u2019s trio of super PACs\u2014Opportunity and Freedom PAC, Opportunity and Freedom PAC I, and Opportunity and Freedom PAC II\u2014was going to act where the campaign couldn\u2019t.\n\nAccording to NBC, Austin Barbour, the central adviser to the three super PACs, said the groups had been planning for some time how to fill the void left by the campaign\u2019s dire financial situation. \u201cWe saw several weeks ago, when the campaign finance reports first came out, that this was probably going to happen with the campaign,\u201d he told NBC. The actual campaign would focus on funding Perry\u2019s travel, Barbour said, and the super PACs would hire staff\u2014particularly in Iowa\u2014to build a competitive ground operation.\n\nIf campaigns and super PACs are supposed to operate independently from each other, it is difficult to see how Perry\u2019s could possibly remain within the confines of the law while aiding each other\u2019s operations in this manner. Jeff Miller, Perry\u2019s campaign manager, emphasized that the unpaid Perry staffers didn\u2019t join the Perry super PACs. \u201cNo Perry for President staffers moved over to the super PAC,\u201d Miller said. He added that since the campaign had stopped paying its staff \u201cat the first of August\u201d it has started to bring \u201cpeople back onto payroll in Iowa and South Carolina.\u201d\n\nIt is difficult to see how Perry\u2019s campaign and super PACs could possibly remain within the confines of the law while aiding each other\u2019s operations in this manner.\n\nBut whether Perry\u2019s aides were shifted from one payroll to another or not, there is little way to tell whether a campaign is playing by the rules, and if it isn\u2019t, there\u2019s little chance it will face any repercussions.\n\nAnd in 2016, Perry is hardly alone in testing the boundaries.\n\n\u201cThe FEC says only certain actions of theirs need to be independent of candidates,\u201d former FEC chairman Trevor Potter said of super PACs.\n\nOperatives at super PACs and campaigns can talk to each other without breaking the law. They can, until the fall, according to The Washington Post, \u201cconfer with a campaign\u201d about \u201cissue ads\u201d that feature a candidate, and a campaign can even, according to some interpretations of the law, receive a super PAC\u2019s \u201centire media plan\u201d on the condition that the campaign offers no input.\n\n\u201cNonetheless,\u201d Potter said, \u201cit appears that these groups may be violating even the commission\u2019s narrower rules.\u201d\n\nCertain relationships between the current crop of candidates and their super PAC staffers have appeared, on the surface, incestuous.\n\nHillary Clinton\u2019s campaign is working directly with Correct the Record, a pro-Clinton super PAC.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s super PAC, Right to Rise, is run by Mike Murphy, his adviser since at least 1988.\n\nRand Paul is supported by America\u2019s Liberty PAC, which is run by Jesse Benton, who is married to Paul\u2019s niece. (Benton was indicted this month, making his future at the PAC uncertain.)\n\nThere is no way to know whether these campaigns and super PACs are complying with the law, which stipulates that if a super PAC spends any money with the cooperation of, in consultation with, or at the request of a candidate, that money is a \u201ccoordinated expenditure\u201d and thus an illegal contribution.\n\nRealistically, Jeb Bush and Mike Murphy, or Hillary Clinton and the staff at Correct the Record, could be talking about the purchase of political ads while cuddling in bed together on a daily basis and nobody would ever know unless the FEC or the Department of Justice opened up an investigation.\n\nAnd they\u2019re not going to do that.\n\n\u201cWhat I think is going on, with respect to presidential candidates across the board, is a) they know the Federal Election Commission is mired in partisan gridlock and will not be enforcing the laws in this cycle; and b) that the Department of Justice has very little history of enforcing campaign law,\u201d Ryan told me. \u201cSo from the view of super PACs, there is no cop on the beat. It\u2019s a Wild West out there.\u201d\n\nPotter agreed. He said the FEC, which is run by three Republicans and three Democrats, has been \u201cessentially deadlocked since the new commissioners came on in 2008 and 2009.\u201d\n\nVotes by the six-person commission are often 3-3 ties, which Potter, Ryan, and FEC Chairwoman Ann Ravel blame on the body\u2019s Republican members: Lee Goodman, Matt Peterson, and Caroline Hunter. The three are, according to their critics, ideologically opposed to campaign finance regulation and are dedicated to carrying out the wishes of the Republican congressional leadership. But Goodman, in a May column for Politico magazine, argued that the makeup of the body is the problem, not its members.\n\nWhatever the cause, the result is gridlock. Nothing gets investigated, no one gets prosecuted, campaigns\u2014but who really knows?\u2014flout the rules.\n\n\u201dIt\u2019s the worst-case scenario,\u201d Potter told me, \u201cwhere you have all of this activity which appears to be in tandem with candidates and outside groups, but nobody is doing anything about it.\u201d\n\nRavel went as far as to bluntly admit to The New York Times that \u201cthe likelihood of the laws being enforced is slim\u2026I never want to give up, but I\u2019m not under any illusions. People think the FEC is dysfunctional. It\u2019s worse than dysfunctional.\u201d\n\nThere has been, so far, only one federal election law prosecution in the post-Citizens era, and it was conducted by the DOJ.\n\nTyler Harber, a Republican political operative from Virginia, pleaded guilty in February to illegally directing a PAC to buy ads in support of Chris Perkins, a congressional candidate whose campaign he managed. Prosecutors said the case was the \u201cfirst criminal prosecution in the United States based upon the coordination of campaign contributions between political committees.\u201d\n\nActivists at the time said the case should be viewed as a warning for candidates and their \u201cindependent\u201d organizations, but there is little evidence that the DOJ is making FEC violations a priority. And were the Obama Justice Department to begin aggressively investigating the 17 Republican presidential campaigns, there would be\u2014perhaps justifiably\u2014outrage on the right.\n\nBut that\u2019s not likely to happen, anyway. While President Obama was once a vocal critic of the corrupting influence of super PACs, he and his party have made peace with the new system, and he has refused to make campaign finance reform a priority.

Bush\u2019s real brother\u2014ideologically, at least\u2014is Senator Marco Rubio?\n\nRubio barnstormed the Granite State on Thursday, bringing with him a campaign stump speech that was heavy on the compassionate conservatism and deeply hawkish foreign policy closely associated with Bush 43.\n\nThe Florida senator can embrace George W. Bush\u2019s message and rhetorical stylings\u2014higher defense spending and domestic policies that will appeal to conservatives but targeted at lower-income Americans\u2014but with the personal authority to speak about the poor in this country. And he can do it without the dynastic baggage that fellow 2016er Jeb Bush brings to the presidential contest.\n\nThe Republican Party hasn\u2019t seen compassionate conservatism in a while. During the heyday of the Tea Party movement, Republicans around the country decried Obama as a food stamp president and demanded drug testing for welfare recipients. Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney came off as apathetic to the poor, and his \u201c47 percent\u201d comments cemented his reputation as a heartless plutocrat in the minds of many voters.\n\nBut Rubio grew up the son of a bartender and a maid, both immigrants. He has a mortgage\u2014just one\u2014that he and his wife pay on the fifth of every month. The Florida senator can speak with familiarity about being poor\u2014which couldn\u2019t be said of Romney, a gazillionaire memorably described by Mike Huckabee as \u201cthe guy who fires you\u201d; John McCain, the son and grandson of admirals; and George W. Bush, the son of a president.\n\nThere are a lot of negative connotations in being compared to George W. Bush. But with Bush\u2019s approval rating recovering with the passage of time, Rubio brings a new face\u2014and new personal authority\u2014to an older perspective on conservatism.\n\n\u201cWe have to reinvigorate our economy, and that begins with recognizing the plight of millions of Americans who today live paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Rubio told a small group of New Hampshire voters at the Derry-Salem Elks Lodge on Thursday. \u201cDo you know why I\u2019m a conservative, why I love free enterprise? Because it\u2019s the only economic model in the history of the world where people like me even have a chance.\u201d\n\nAnd Rubio\u2019s emphasis on increased defense spending and a renewed willingness to use America\u2019s military might abroad is also reminiscent of George W. Bush. Asked by an attendee what he would do in his first 100 days in the White House, Rubio's first three off-the cuff ideas were about national security.\n\n\u201cI would immediately ask Congress for a supplemental budget authority to increase defense spending,\u201d Rubio said. It was a topic he hammered over and over again: \u201cWe need a strong America on the global stage, because nothing else matters if we\u2019re not safe. And that starts with having the strongest military in the world. Today we are eviscerating our military, we have had rapid reductions in defense spending... We can\u2019t solve all the world's problems, but we can always be on the side of moral clarity.\u201d\n\nBut the capital-B, capital-I Big Idea that Rubio is campaigning on is that the things that guaranteed middle-class stability and opportunity for the poor in the 20th century no longer work today. Touching on subjects ranging from social security to whether a college education will guarantee a job to the Veterans Administration, Rubio held three town halls in New Hampshire, all of which touched on how to improve the lot of the less well off.\n\n\u201cOne of the fundamental issues that I\u2019ve been campaigning on is the argument that the 21st century is dramatically different from the 20th, that things that used to work in the past don\u2019t work as well now because the world has changed,\u201d Rubio said at a Concerned Veterans for America event, where he urged reforms to the VA system broadly, Tri-Care military health insurance, and the vets\u2019 disability claims process.\n\nRubio also wants to reform the higher education system. He wants more students to pursue technical degrees, and college credit to be more easily granted for students with work experience or military service. A military service member who served two tours in Iraq shouldn\u2019t be made to sit through a course on modern Middle Eastern politics, he said.\n\n\u201cIn the 21st century it is not enough to just have a college degree,\u201d Rubio said. He wants college loans to be granted only after colleges tell each student the average annual wage for the major and degree that they\u2019ve chosen.\n\nAsked by an attendee what he would do in his first 100 days in the White House, Rubio\u2019s first three off-the cuff ideas were about national security.\n\nMany of the other ideas are fundamentally the same as 2000s conservatism: tax cuts for small businesses, increasing the child tax credit for working families, and reversing environmental regulations that hinder economic growth.\n\n\u201cThe more people you hire, the more you pay them, and the more you expand\u2014the less you will owe the IRS. We need a tax code that allows businesses to immediately [reinvest] back into their employees,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nHis style impressed some of the locals, many of whom consider it their civic duty to put presidential candidates on the hot seat.\n\n\u201cHis off-the-cuff remarks: He\u2019s moving up on the electability scale. He\u2019s sliding up,\u201d said Jorg Dreusick, a veteran from Pelham, New Hampshire who placed Rubio near the top of his list of top five presidential contenders. He attended both the morning event in Exeter and the early afternoon event in Salem.\n\nOne thing Rubio simply didn\u2019t do while campaigning in New Hampshire: He didn't toss the crowd the red meat they really wanted. He got the largest applause out of one crowd when he spoke about Benghazi (\u201cincompetence\u201d) and about President Obama (\u201cwho has chosen to divide us against each other, for [the] purpose of winning elections\u201d). But those lines were responses to questions raised by the crowd.\n\nUnlike some other presidential candidates, who thrive on the raucous response of the conservative primary audiences, Rubio didn\u2019t pander. Asked for his priorities as president, he geeked out on the proper role of the National Security Council, an issue unlikely to resonate with vast swaths of the electorate. Then he said he wanted centralized cybersecurity procedures so that agencies use best practices to protect information.\n\nHe even went out of his way to take a little shot at someone the many Patriots fans in attendance surely consider a hero.\n\n\u201cTom Brady, when is he going to retire?\u201d he asked the New Hampshire crowd.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:52.412+0000"}

But maybe 95-5 (or something close) is the new normal.\n\nHere\u2019s one story I predict you\u2019re going to read (should you choose to) about 367 times over the next 17 months: that Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t going to do as well or maybe even nearly as well among African-American voters, because, well, it\u2019s obvious. Black people, we\u2019ll be told, won\u2019t be enthusiastic about turning out to vote for her, because what\u2019s she ever done for them. And of course some portion of those 367 stories will feature breathless speculation that the Republican, whoever it is, just might surprise us among black voters, because remember what George W. Bush did in 2004, and the younger generation of African Americans don\u2019t feel the old loyalty to the Democrats their parents did, and, and, and, you can write the rest yourself.\n\nIt will be a key element in the \u201cHillary\u2019s in Trouble\u201d meme that\u2019s going to dominate the coverage of her campaign in the mainstream media. But is there any truth to it?\n\nYes, a little. Clinton and John Podesta and her other strategists are acknowledging as much with the big speech she gave yesterday in Texas laying the lumber into Republicans about voting rights and recent GOP voter-suppression schemes. This was her first capital-P Political speech of the campaign, and that she chose to make that speech about this topic and not a broader economic one, or one aimed squarely at women, say, demonstrates clearly enough that Clinton is concerned about getting out the black vote.\n\nIt was also a partisan speech, of the sort she doesn\u2019t usually give and most presidential candidates don\u2019t typically deliver this early in the process. If it\u2019s true that partisanship turns off centrist voters, and it is to some extent, then the Clinton camp obviously made the calculation that with respect to this issue and the larger goal of black turnout, alienating some white independent voters is a price worth paying.\n\nBut how much worrying does Clinton really need to do here? The standard media line, as suggested above, will be that Obama skewed things by being black and all, and that if you go back to 2004 and recall that George W. Bush got 16 percent of the black vote in Ohio, that was somehow a more \u201cnormal\u201d state of affairs, because there were two white candidates.\n\nSo, let\u2019s look at the numbers. Yes, Obama did skew things. He won the black vote 95-4 in 2008 and 93-6 in 2012. By contrast, John Kerry won the black vote 88-11. If you go back to 1964, that\u2019s exactly what the Democratic nominee averages, 88 percent. The Republican averages 10 percent.\n\nAside from head-to-head numbers, there\u2019s the matter of turnout. Obama also inspired blacks to vote in larger numbers, of course, so they made up 13 percent of the overall electorate in 2008 and 2012, as opposed to 11 percent in 2004. The increase in Ohio was particularly striking. In 2004, blacks constituted 10 percent of the total Ohio vote. In 2012, they were 15 percent.\n\nWhen Gerald Ford was getting 15 percent of the black vote in 1976, his party wasn\u2019t carrying out a jihad to make sure as few black people could vote as possible or uncorking champagne when the Supreme Court struck down the Voting Rights Act.\n\nBut here\u2019s the question. Are the Obama-era numbers an aberration, or are they more like a new normal? The near-universal assumption among journalists is aberration. But here\u2019s the case for why they might be something closer to the new normal, which rests on two points.\n\nThe first is the much-discussed demographic change. The white vote over the last three presidential elections has gone from 77 percent (2004) to 74 percent (2008) to 72 percent (2012). If the Obama era was an aberration, you\u2019d expect that figure to bounce back up. But electoral demographers say quite the opposite. One comprehensive statistical model predicts that the white vote will just keep dropping, down maybe to 70 percent in 2016. The African-American vote is expected to at least hold steady at 13.\n\nBut second and more important, it\u2019s about the Republican Party of then versus now. When Gerald Ford was getting 15 percent of the black vote in 1976, his party wasn\u2019t carrying out a jihad to make sure as few black people could vote as possible or uncorking champagne when the Supreme Court struck down the Voting Rights Act. Or, for that matter, trying to make sure as few working poor people as possible could have access to health insurance.\n\nWhen I was young I thought Ronald Reagan\u2019s Republican Party was bad on race, and it was, but the GOP is a far more openly and aggressively anti-black-people party today. Back then, there were still a fair number of moderate Republicans in the House and Senate who voted for civil rights measures. Arguably the greatest legal crusader against segregation of the 1960s and 1970s was a Republican, the venerable John Doar. Heck, Republicans in Congress even reauthorized the VRA when Dubya was president! Those days are long, long gone. Maybe not forever, but certainly for the foreseeable future.\n\nClinton will have to work it. And she is\u2014a proposal for automatic voter registration for every citizen who turns 18 (unless that citizen decides to opt out), which she called for in the speech, is great stuff. But her competition\u2014unless they nominate Rand Paul, which seems increasingly unlikely\u2014is making it easier for her. She probably won\u2019t duplicate Obama\u2019s numbers, but if someone wants to bet you that her black-vote totals will be closer to John Kerry\u2019s than to Obama\u2019s, that\u2019s a bet I\u2019d advise you to take in heartbeat.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:52.555+0000"}
{"entityId": 2000, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "You don\u2019t have to say you love her, because the election isn\u2019t even directly about her. It\u2019s about finally undoing the Reagan revolution.\n\nIn the last few days, I\u2019ve heard from a couple of relatives who have, or know of friends who have, come down with a case of Hillary Anxiety. Having covered Clinton\u2019s 2000 Senate race closely and spoken at the time with many New York women among whom the malady was first diagnosed, I know the symptoms well.\n\nThey like her, generally speaking, and admire her (I should note that Hillary Anxiety is not limited to women by any means, although it is perhaps more sharply felt by them than by men). They want to see her succeed. They yearn for her to slay the beasts of sexism and gender-role definitions that she has taken it upon herself to battle. Hillary Anxiety, in these respects, is very different from Hillary Distrust or Contempt, which is the more commonly found inflammation among journalists and others inside the Beltway. The Hillary-Anxious are basically on her side.\n\nBut those symptoms: they\u2019re queasy, these folks. The years of charges (valid or not) about corruption, the endless debates about how polarizing she is\u2026it leaves some people feeling exhausted. Before the race has even started, really! Oh, Lord. I like Hillary and want her to be president, but am I really ready to slog through all this\u2026crap again?\n\nThe anxiety is compounded in this case by the natural liberal inclination to want to fall in love, to become besotted. Yes, sure, conservatives want to love their nominees too; but liberals more so. Conservatives have a much more limited agenda; the main changes they really want are lower taxes and to be left alone. But liberals behold a nation and world that is wanting in a thousand ways, and they want their nominee to fix it all! That\u2019s a prodigious faith to place in one person, and a faith that prodigious requires love. Liberals want to fall in love, like they did in 2008.\n\nAll this puts Clinton in a pickle. People aren\u2019t going to love her like they loved Barack Obama. Actually, check that, in part: There are in fact millions of Americans who adore Clinton. I saw them in 2000, too; mothers at upstate county fairgrounds, waiting an hour on the rope line to introduce their daughters to Hillary. You don\u2019t become America\u2019s most admired woman in 17 of the last 20 years without lots of people loving you, but somehow this cohort doesn\u2019t register much on the Washington radar screen.\n\nSo some\u2014many\u2014people do love Clinton, but it\u2019s fair to say that this campaign is just not going to be like Obama\u2019s. Obama was a fresh entity; no real baggage. There was nothing complicated or vexing about getting your heart behind Obama (provided you managed to rationalize away Jeremiah Wright and the verb \u201ccling,\u201d which most liberals did). But basically he was tabula rasa. With Hillary, though, there\u2019s 20-plus years of history here that she, and in our own ways each of us, has to carry into the boxing ring.\n\nSome of the reasons for Hillary Anxiety are real\u2014even though their enemies usually misfire, the Clintons do have a way of handing them round after round of ammunition.\n\nSo this isn\u2019t about love. It\u2019s about a deal between Clinton and liberals. It\u2019s strictly business, and it\u2019s about work. The work of maintaining Democratic control of the White House and keeping the loony right at bay for another four or eight years. The work of trying to move the country forward to a post-supply side economic paradigm. And, yeah, the work of electing our first woman president.\n\nIf you don\u2019t love Hillary, let me offer you two things to love:\n\n1. A liberal majority on the Supreme Court for the next 30, 40 years. You know that the next president may name three or four new justices. Two liberals, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, will likely retire soon. A Republican president would be able to expand the conservative majority to seven, replacing the two aforementioned with two more Alitos or Scalias. Sit with that.\n\nPresident Clinton, on the other hand, will replace them with liberals and may replace Anthony Kennedy or Antonin Scalia, or both, with liberal justices (I\u2019m not wishing illness on anyone here, just being actuarial about things). We haven\u2019t had a liberal Supreme Court majority in this country in 35 years. Such a court would reverse loads of terrible Rehnquist-Roberts era decisions\u2014it would restore voting rights, reverse school re-segregation, revisit the Second Amendment; at the same time it would uphold Roe, defend affirmative action, endorse workplace anti-discrimination policies for LGBT people, and on and on. And those are just the things the Court does that generate the big headlines. Corporate personhood; workers\u2019 rights; campaign finance laws; campaign finance laws (right, I wrote that twice). If you are a liberal and these things aren\u2019t awfully important to you, well, it\u2019s hard to understand exactly what sort of liberal you are.\n\n2. A coming civil war in the Republican Party, and the hope/prayer of a little moderation on its part. When a party loses two consecutive presidential elections, the losses can be chalked up to the appearance of a charismatic candidate and, then, the powers of his incumbency. But three; that\u2019s when people have to start looking hard in the mirror.\n\nCertainly, there will be some in the GOP who\u2019ll trot out the \u201cwe weren\u2019t conservative enough\u201d argument if their side loses. But say Clinton wins with somewhere between Obama\u2019s 2008 total of 365 electoral votes and his 2012 performance of 332; say 347 (Obama\u2019s \u201912 map plus North Carolina). A party that has won 173, 206, and 191 electoral votes, respectively, in the last three elections is a party that\u2019s simply never going to have a prayer of hitting 270 without some major changes.\n\nFor one thing this would be great fun to watch. If the party goes crazy(er), it could split in two. And if it decides to respond with sanity, there\u2019s a great silver lining in that for Democrats and for the country: Tea Party power will wane, non-extreme Republicans won\u2019t fear Club for Growth-financed primary challengers so much, and some of them will actually make compromises and legislate!\n\nI could go on, but you get the idea. What I\u2019m talking about here is not just a handful of policies. I\u2019m talking about the bulk of the Reagan-Gingrich-Bush legacy. Obama could not undo it because he had to deal with the Great Recession. But eight more years of a Democratic presidency can do exactly that\u2014undo it, across a whole range of fronts.\n\nThis and nothing else is the basis of the deal. This election isn\u2019t about Clinton\u2019s personality or vision or lack of it or anything else that\u2019s directly about her. It\u2019s about having the chance to undo what conservatism has wrought for two generations. I can assure you\u2014smart conservatives understand these to be precisely the stakes, if the Democrats win two more straight presidential elections.\n\nThis is not of course to say that people should bottle up all their reservations about Clinton and support her blindly. Some of the reasons for Hillary Anxiety are real\u2014even though their enemies usually misfire, the Clintons do have a way of handing them round after round of ammunition.\n\nAnd we should always have reservations. In fact, that\u2019s one of the key things liberals ought to have learned from 2008: There are no saviors. There is just the hard trench warfare of politics fought within the confines of a system with checks and balances that an obstructionist minority can exploit to great effect. Under this system, victories, like the health care bill, count for a lot; but so too do losses staved off, like handing the top 1 percent still more massive tax relief while adding $2.4 trillion to the deficit, as a President Rubio would do. And they tell us he\u2019s one of the reasonable ones.\n\nTo be a meaningful deal, though, a deal needs two sides, and Clinton has to hold up her end here as well. Simply put, she can\u2019t blow it. The pressure not to blow it is heightened by the fact that she will apparently have no serious intra-party competition. If you\u2019re the franchise player, you\u2019d damn well better get your 30 in the championship game. This is why I wrote last week, apropos the foundation mess, that she and Bill had best clean it up and clean it up fast. I think she deserves liberals\u2019 presumptive support with the minimum of media-induced anxiety. But she better not let us down.\n\nSome early signs are encouraging. It can\u2019t be said enough what an improvement John Podesta is as chief strategist over Mark Penn. Leaps and bounds, ideologically, strategically, ethically, you name it. It reflects well on her judgment that she made this change. And she deserves more credit than she seems to have been getting, in Washington liberal circles anyway, for this criminal justice speech. She called for an end to the era of mass incarceration. When is the last time a first-tier Democratic presidential candidate said that? Heck, her husband, working within the confines of the post-Reagan political landscape, helped to exacerbate that problem. If she is able to follow through on only that, what an incredible undoing of the post-backlash conservative legacy\u2014and change for young black men in this country.\n\nThis is where we are right now in the United States\u2014on the cusp of the end, finally and definitively, of the Age of Reagan. It is attained through seriousness of purpose and focus on the things that matter, on her part and ours.

{"entityId": 2002, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "What can you expect from a Republican presidential debate starring Donald Trump? Glad you asked.\n\nWhen my editor at The Daily Beast asked me to put together a list of things \u201cwe should watch for\u201d in Thursday\u2019s Republican debates, what he was really asking was this: \u201cWhat will be the one thing that every columnist writes about on Friday?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat will be the thing every Sunday show talks about?\u201d\u2014\u201cWhat will be the clip that is shown ad nauseam on cable news?\u201d\u2014in essence, \u201cWhat will be the storyline?\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the real question. And despite the predictable talk about the great ratings, few people will weigh their electoral decisions based on having studiously weighed all the evidence presented in a two-hour debate. We all know that more people will be influenced by the narrative the press settles on: \u201cNixon looked sweaty,\u201d \u201cGeorge H.W. Bush looked at his watch,\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s Admiral Stockdale??\u201d\n\nSo what are some likely narratives to keep an eye on? Glad you asked\u2026\n\n1. Which Donald Trump shows up? They used to say that half the people who paid to see a Muhammad Ali fight were paying to see him win; the other half were paying to see him get knocked out. Like Ali, Trump is a master showman who knows how to talk trash and gin up excitement (if only there were a \u201cweigh-in\u201d before the debate). And like Ali, all eyes will be on him. Half of us will be rooting for him to give them hell; the other half will be hoping he gets a bloody lip. But what if he doesn\u2019t live up to the hype? Some recent interviews suggest that Trump might be about to (to borrow a phrase from Ali) \u201crope-a-dope\u201d his opponents. Or maybe the more likely analogy is when Rocky lost all that weight in Rocky III and completely changed his fighting style. Either way, it\u2019s possible that while everyone on stage is counting on Trump the Entertainer to show up, what we\u2019ll get is Trump the Statesman. (Or, you know, Trump\u2019s impression of a statesman.) What if he now accepts his role as front-runner, pivots, and tones down the rhetoric a bit? It\u2019s unclear whether or not Trump has the patience or inclination to pull that off. But he might.\n\n2. Will the \u201ckids table\u201d be better than the \u201cadult table\u201d? Only the top 10 candidates will participate in the top-tier debate Thursday night. The rest will participate in a 5 p.m. ET debate. But it\u2019s entirely possible that the narrative will be that the earlier debate was actually better. For one thing, you\u2019ve got some serious candidates (Perry, Santorum, Jindal, Fiorina, et al.) who will be in this earlier scrum. These are formidable candidates. What if the big debate turns into a mess (thanks to Donald Trump), but the first debate is conversely serious and high-minded? That\u2019s actually not an unlikely scenario. There\u2019s also the possibility that something said in the earlier debate will be so newsworthy that the moderators at the second debate have to mention it or ask a question about it. \u201cEarlier today, Carly Fiorina said such and such. How would you respond?\u201d There\u2019s also a chance for the beginnings of a comeback story. Rick Perry, who narrowly missed participating in the main event, has a chance to redeem himself from his disappointing 2012 debate performances. Just as Mike Huckabee was able to impress people in 2008 and propel himself into the top-tier, it\u2019s entirely possible that some of the candidates who are relegated to the \u201ckiddy\u201d table this time around will get promoted in a future debate.\n\nWhat if someone were to ask Trump if he thinks Cruz (who was born in Canada) is eligible to be president?\n\n3. Protests or interruptions. Presumably, security will be tight, but it\u2019s possible the big story will be that someone interrupts the debate. This could be Code Pink or #BlackLivesMatter or some right-wing group. If that happens, the response\u2014from the candidates, the police, and/or the moderators\u2014will be under close scrutiny. There\u2019s also always a possibility that something will occur outside the event hall itself that might overshadow the main event.\n\n4. How does Jeb do? Let\u2019s not forget that Jeb Bush is, in many ways, still considered the front-runner (despite Trump\u2019s poll numbers). This will be a huge test for him. Does he come across like the serious adult next to Trump? Or does he come across looking like a weak scold? Either option is entirely possible. One thing Jeb does have going for him is his imposing physical stature, which might serve to counter the \u201cwonky,\u201d \u201cRINO,\u201d \u201cwimp\u201d factor\u2014especially depending on how the camera shots juxtapose the candidates when they shake hands before the fight, err, debate.\n\n5. Do the candidates go after Trump? Of course, it\u2019s entirely possible Trump comes out throwing elbows and the debate descends into chaos (like that time Rocky fought Thunder Lips, the wrestler played by Hulk Hogan). Based on my reading of the debate rules, a candidate who is mentioned by name gets to respond. This is an important rule, because one assumes that \u201ctime of possession\u201d (the amount of screen time each candidate receives) is a large factor in terms of his ability to \u201cwin\u201d the debate. In a rational world, where the other non-Trump Republican candidates would cooperate, they might agree to simply not mention Trump\u2019s name\u2014thereby depriving him of any extra time. The problem is that several of the candidates will have an incentive to pick a fight with Trump. The downside, of course, is that Trump might embarrass them. But the upside is there\u2019s no better way to ensure your video clip gets played on a loop the next day than to tangle with Trump. For obvious reasons, the cable news networks will be biased toward showing that kind of footage. And, you don\u2019t get knocked out by Trump, the assumption is that all publicity is good publicity. In other words, the worst thing that can happen to you in this debate is to be an afterthought (this could be a danger for someone like Scott Walker, a top-tier candidate who\u2019s not known for his charisma). Getting into a skirmish\u2014even if you don\u2019t necessarily win\u2014guarantees attention and press coverage.\n\n6. Unholy alliances? While it\u2019s unrealistic to think that all the non-Trump candidates would conspire to refuse to take his bait, it is entirely possible that we will once again see some unofficial alliances emerge. Sometimes, debates create strange bedfellows. In 2012, for example, it seemed quite obvious to me that Michele Bachmann was actually helping Mitt Romney\u2014by virtue of attacking candidates like Tim Pawlenty and Rick Perry from the right. Now, these alliances are marriages of convenience. Eventually, should both candidates in the marriage remain in the race, they will have to turn on each other\u2014like Hulk Hogan and Andre the Giant, Hulk Hogan and Randy \u201cMacho Man\u201d Savage, Hulk Hogan and Gawker. You get the idea. Eventually, this becomes a zero-sum game. But, for now, there are a lot of variables and a lot of candidates\u2014and having someone carry your water and do your dirty work is a plus. And one interesting thing to keep an eye on will be the budding \u201cbromance\u201d between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Keep an eye on that.\n\n7. Zingers? \u201cI paid for this microphone!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re no Jack Kennedy.\u201d Every once in a while, someone rises to the occasion in a debate and lands a terrific sound bite\u2014or even a knockout punch. The interesting thing is that there are numerous candidates who are capable of this. Let\u2019s take Chris Christie for example. We\u2019re not talking much about him, but it\u2019s entirely possible that we\u2019re talking about him on Friday. Or let\u2019s refer to the Cruz/Trump alliance. What if someone were to ask Trump if he thinks Cruz (who was born in Canada) is eligible to be president?\n\n8. Surprises. Let\u2019s be honest, this first debate is actually quite exciting. Nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen. There are a million possible narratives. \u201cCruz hits Rubio over immigration,\u201d \u201cJohn Kasich shines,\u201d \u201cLindsey Graham falls off stage, \u201cBen Carson wows them.\u201d Other things to look out for\u2014things nobody thinks about\u2014are body language and camera response shots. Candidates seen subtly rolling their eyes, heard sighing, spotted looking at their watches\u2014all these things matter.\n\n9. Gaffes? \u201cYou\u2019re likable enough.\u201d \u201cBinders full of women.\u201d There\u2019s always the chance for someone to say something stupid.\n\n10. Will candidates break the debate rules? It\u2019s almost a fool\u2019s errand to complain when someone breaks the debate rules. Complaining is the kind of thing Mitt Romney did\u2014and it doesn\u2019t tend to work. The only way to stop it is for the moderators to step in.\n\n11. How will Fox News do? Speaking of the moderators, this will be a big test for the network. My guess is that they will do great. It would be a mistake for candidates to assume that\u2014because Fox is ostensibly \u201cconservative\u201d\u2014they won\u2019t get asked tough questions. Expect hardball questions and questions that make the candidates think on their feet. On the other hand, in their quest to demonstrate that they are willing to be tough on Republicans, it\u2019s possible they might overshoot. Conservatives are tired of the kinds of wedge issue questions that make Republicans look bad and put them on the defensive. What if the attitude coming out of the debate is: \u201cWe might as well have just had Chris Matthews moderate?\u201d\n\n12. Are the debates a net plus for Republicans? At some point, debates quit being like internal practice rounds and became public scrimmage games. The point of a primary debate might be to help select the party standard bearer, but it\u2019s also a nationally broadcast \u201cgame\u201d that will influence how viewers perceive the team. The RNC has taken special care to limit the number of debates and select appropriate media outlets to mitigate the damage that could be done by some ugly on-field behavior. But when the clock strikes 11 on Thursday night, will they be better off than they were two hours before? Will the candidates focus their ire on Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, go after Mitch McConnell, John Boehner, and the \u201cWashington Cartel\u201d\u2014or will they turn on each other?\n\nIn short, will it be a clown car?\n\nDisclaimer: The author\u2019s wife advises Rick Perry, and previously served as a consultant on Ted Cruz\u2019s Senate campaign.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:53.010+0000"}

{"entityId": 2004, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Why won\u2019t the Republican hopeful come clean about his involvement with two of Wall Street\u2019s biggest banks?\n\nJeb Bush says he released 33 years of tax returns this week because he wants to be the most transparent candidate to run for president in 2016. But if that\u2019s really the case, why is he continuing to obfuscate some of his most lucrative and potentially controversial business dealings he had before announcing his candidacy, like his work as an \u201cadviser\u201d for investment bank Lehman Brothers?\n\nSo, if Jeb won\u2019t tell you what Jeb exactly did while working on Wall Street, in the interests of transparency and disclosure, I will try.\n\nNot much is known about what Bush actually did for Lehman\u2014the firm that went belly-up in 2008 and sparked the wider financial crisis, and Barclays, the bank that purchased Lehman out of bankruptcy and continues to work out of its midtown Manhattan headquarters. He began working for the former after his term as Florida governor ended in 2007, and continued working for the latter until the end of 2014, when he decided to run for president.\n\nThe two banks were his biggest sources of income in recent years: Bush earned more than $14 million working for Lehman and then Barclays, which based on my understanding of simple math accounted for nearly half of the $29 million he made after he left government. Yet in Tuesday\u2019s disclosure, and even in many of his public comments, Bush has downplayed his work for the two banks.\n\n\u201cI also was hired as a senior advisor to Barclays where I advised their clients on a wide range of global economic issues with a mind towards navigating government policies,\u201d he writes in an essay that accompanied the tax returns. It is the only sentence that refers to his time at Barclays. And he doesn\u2019t mention Lehman at all.\n\nIn recent weeks I\u2019ve interviewed numerous Wall Street executives about Jeb Bush, and his role at both firms. What emerges is a portrait of a bank \u201cadviser\u201d who operated more like a high-level investment banker.\n\nA spokeswoman for Bush declined to provide specifics about his work for the banks other than point to various media accounts, including those by this reporter. But Bush, according to people with direct knowledge of his activities, helped the firm look for business from well-heeled clients, including everyone from hedge funds to billionaire investors like Carlos Slim Helu, the Mexican business magnate widely regarded as the world\u2019s richest man.\n\nAnd, in at least one instance, he appears to have been Lehman\u2019s go-to man for an emergency investment during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nWhat emerges is a portrait of a bank \u201cadviser\u201d who operated more like a high-level investment banker.\n\nIn his seven years working for both banks, Bush was paid handsomely for this work, but he was also thrust into several awkward situations. A couple of years ago, he met with executives from the Minneapolis-based hedge fund Whitebox Advisors, a major Barclays client. Bush was supposed to be providing high-level insight into economic issues for the big hedge fund, which was one of a handful that correctly predicted the mortgage meltdown that eventually led to Lehman\u2019s collapse.\n\nBut according to people who were present, the meeting soon turned uncomfortable when Whitebox\u2019s chief executive, Andrew Redleaf, began to openly browbeat Bush on his brother\u2019s record as president, including his handling of the Iraq War.\n\nA spokeswoman for Redleaf declined to comment but would not deny the account; a spokeswoman for Bush had no comment.\n\nOne investment banker who has direct knowledge of Bush\u2019s work for Lehman and Barclays says over the past seven years, the former governor has had \u201cdozens and dozens and dozens\u201d such meetings with clients and prospective clients of Lehman and Barclays. One of those clients included Slim, the Mexican billionaire, which looms as one of the most controversial aspects of Bush\u2019s private business dealings. This is because, if accurate, it shows how closely Bush worked with Lehman officials during the firm\u2019s final days.\n\nAccording to former Lehman executives and various news reports, Bush met with Slim to ask him to make an investment in the firm in the summer of 2008. The investment never happened, and Lehman, famously, filed for bankruptcy in September of that year.\n\nBush campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell seems to deny at least some of this account. \u201cGovernor Bush met with Carlos Slim. It was regarding a specific telecom project,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cIt was not regarding [a] general Carlos Slim infusion of cash to save Lehman Brothers.\u201d\n\nShe would not deny, however, that this investment could in some way have helped prop up Lehman Brothers. In fact, Campbell also refused to outright deny past media reports, including this one in The New York Times, which cites emails explaining how Bush was involved something called \u201cProject Verde,\u201d a firm-wide effort to get an investment from Slim and potentially help save Lehman from collapse in 2008.\n\nIndeed, former Lehman executives say senior executives at the firm had discussed using Bush as a direct conduit to policymakers\u2014including those reporting to his brother, who was president during the financial crisis\u2014as Lehman was sinking further into insolvency and regulators balked at including the firm in their broader bailout packages.\n\nCampbell says Bush never intervened with people reporting to his brother. \u201cI do want to be very explicit on one point: Governor Bush was never asked to contact his brother\u2019s administration regarding Lehman, and if he had been asked, would not have done it,\u201d she said in an email.\n\nDon\u2019t expect to find any of what I\u2019m reporting here when Bush releases a more detailed financial disclosure forms in a few weeks with federal election officials. Given Lehman\u2019s role in the 2008 financial meltdown, it\u2019s easy to see why the former governor would like people to focus on what he billed the other day as the \u201cbroken tax system that\u2019s one of the most convoluted and anti-growth in the world\u201d rather than the work he did that earned him millions and forced him to pay into that broken tax system.\n\nIt\u2019s of course hard to argue that Bush shouldn\u2019t earn a living from his contacts in business that he made in government (Bush stated he never lobbied on behalf of a company) or inherited through his family connections. This is especially true when you consider the hyper-sleaze of Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, who became a mega millionaire almost overnight by constructing possibly the most conflicted political-business-charity machines in modern political history.\n\nBut as an avowed small-government conservative, you would think Bush would know all about corrosive effects of crony capitalism, where executives at the big banks sit at its epicenter, ready to call in favors from politicians who in turn can help make those executives make a lot of money. For that reason, it\u2019s time for Jeb to fess up about all the work he did for Lehman and Barclays. Only then can he brag that he\u2019s acting \u201cin the spirit of transparency.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:54.408+0000"}

Julian Castro is her obvious choice\u2014especially against Rubio.\n\nAs Democrats browse through potential 2016 vice presidential candidates looking for someone young, exciting, and different, does it really come down to Julian Castro\u2014or nothing?\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the U.S. Housing Secretary, a 40-year-old rising star in the Democratic Party, is rumored to be on Hillary Clinton\u2019s veep short list. Certainly, he\u2019s already out there auditioning for the job by defending Clinton\u2019s decision to use a private email server as Secretary of State and dismissing Republican criticism as \u201ca witch hunt.\u201d\n\nThe surprise is that there is a new rumor circulating that suggests Castro\u2019s name is the only one on the list.\n\nFor Henry Cisneros, who served as U.S. Housing Secretary in the Clinton administration, the idea is a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cWhat I am hearing in Washington, including from people in Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, is that the first person on their lists is Julian Castro, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who used to be the mayor of San Antonio,\u201d Cisneros told Jorge Ramos, host of Al Punto, Univision\u2019s Sunday show. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a second option, because he is the superior candidate considering his record, personality, demeanor, and Latin heritage.\u201d\n\nCastro and his twin brother, Joaquin, a congressman from San Antonio, were born in the United States. But their grandmother, Victoria, crossed the U.S.-Mexico border as a child in 1920. Castro is popular, even beloved, among segments of the highly consequential Latino community\u2014especially among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, a subset that represent about two-thirds of the estimated 54 million Latinos in the United States.\n\nLatinos matter because every month, about 50,000 of them turn 18 and become eligible to vote. Mexicans and Mexican-Americans matter disproportionately because they\u2019re swing voters who are largely in play, more so than conservative Cuban-Americans or Central Americans who tend to vote Republican or liberal Puerto Ricans and Dominican-Americans who tend to vote Democratic. Most Mexicans and Mexican-Americans are registered Democrats, but they will support moderate Republicans who reach out to them. Just ask George W. Bush, who earned 44 percent of the Latino vote against John Kerry in 2004.\n\nIf Rubio wins the Republican nomination and squares off against Clinton, don\u2019t be surprised if many Latinos\u2014even some lifelong Democrats\u2014break ranks to support him.\n\nWith Latinos figuring prominently in three battleground states\u2014Colorado, Nevada and Florida\u2014those are votes that Democrats can\u2019t afford to lose. Putting Castro on the ticket would be an insurance policy.\n\n\u201cI think there is a very high possibility that Hillary Clinton may choose Julian Castro,\u201d Cisneros told Ramos.\n\nThere is an equally high possibility that Cisneros may have spoken too soon, or that he might be working an angle.\n\nI\u2019ve known Castro for more than 12 years, and we\u2019ve shared many conversations\u2014on and off the record. Yet I\u2019ve never thought about my friend being vice presidential material. At least not yet.\n\nPersonally, I think Cisneros\u2014a first-rate political operator, whom I\u2019ve known twice as long as I\u2019ve known Castro\u2014is up to something. He could be turning up the heat on Clinton, pressuring her to choose Castro. He could be establishing himself as the go-between, telling people that\u2014if Castro is chosen to join the ticket\u2014getting to the candidate means going through him. Or he could be trying to keep Latinos enthused about the 2016 election, giving them some hope that a party that takes them for granted could throw them a bone.\n\nStill, Cisneros is right about how slim the pickings are for Democrats. As prospective veep candidates go, beyond Castro, who else is there? Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is running a quixotic campaign against Clinton. Former Maryland Governor Martin O\u2019Malley has announced he's running, too. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is someone that many on the left would like to see enter the race, but who doesn\u2019t seem interested. And Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, a favorite within Democratic circles, is seen as someone who could appeal to a number of demographic groups.\n\nBut even with those Democratic candidates\u2019 and their respective strengths, Castro could be a better fit. He would certainly be an exciting choice. The 40-year-old has a great resume, having graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law School before returning home to San Antonio to run successfully for the City Council and eventually serve three terms as mayor. His big break came in 2012, when he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. Soon thereafter, he joined the Obama cabinet.\n\nNow Castro has the attention of insiders. Last month, my Daily Beast colleague Eleanor Clift suggested that Castro was being put through a kind of informal \u201cVP training camp\u201d by the elders of the Democratic Party. Another Beast, Matt Lewis, thinks Castro is all sizzle and no carne asada, recently calling him \u201cthe least-qualified nominee for the job in decades.\u201d\n\nOf course, governors and senators are the safe choice when picking a running mate. But there aren\u2019t many Latino Democrats at that level. Here\u2019s why: There is a hierarchy in place with the Democratic Party where liberal whites and African-Americans expect Latino leaders to turn out Latino voters to support their candidates while discouraging those leaders from seeking the top jobs themselves.\n\nIt happened to Castro, in fact. After the convention speech, when his stock was high, Democratic leaders in Texas pressured him to pass on a run for governor in 2014 and instead support the party\u2019s choice: State Sen. Wendy Davis, who was eventually soundly defeated.\n\nCastro also has a quality that Americans are hungry for in their elected officials: humility. Growing up in the working-class part of San Antonio, the Castro brothers learned that they were entitled to nothing and better than no one. They don\u2019t think America owes them anything. On the contrary, they\u2019re the ones with a debt to repay.\n\nYou know who that sounds like? The one Republican that Democrats are most afraid of, because they don\u2019t know how to run against him and they\u2019re not sure they can beat him.\n\nMarco Rubio hit a home run with the speech in which he formally announced his candidacy. The senator from Florida talked about his parents\u2014the father who worked as a bartender, and the mother who labored as a hotel maid\u2014and how they never expected anything from this country and only wanted the chance to work hard so that their children could realize their dreams.\n\nThat\u2019s pure gold, especially during an election where Americans have to choose between two well-known brands. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush have one thing in common: They\u2019re both running for president because they think they\u2019re entitled to the office. Simply put, it\u2019s their turn.\n\nIf Rubio wins the Republican nomination and squares off against Clinton, don\u2019t be surprised if many Latinos\u2014even some lifelong Democrats\u2014break ranks to support him.\n\nAnd, as Clinton searches for a running mate, \u201cqualified\u201d will come down to this: Can this person help me stop the bleeding and keep Latinos in the Democratic column?\n\nDemocrats will be looking for a counterweight to Rubio, someone from humble beginnings who understands that America is an idea that is so much larger than special interests and individual ambition.\n\nLuckily, they have someone like that warming up in the bullpen.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:54.820+0000"}

But a reform Republican who harnesses grassroots hostility to crony capitalism could be perfectly positioned to take on Hillary Clinton.\n\nStrange as it may seem, the strongest Republican presidential candidate will make fixing the corrupt system of influence in Washington a central commitment of their administration.\n\nThe overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton, has long dodged claims of influence peddling. Those claims are now surfacing more vigorously, as a book by Peter Schweizer fuels new streams of inquiry into the relationship between the Clinton Foundation\u2019s fundraising and the behavior of the State Department.\n\nIt\u2019s too early to know whether any of these charges have merit. My bias is to believe they do not. But whether or not they ultimately stick, they reinforce a wide range of criticism that, over the course of her and her husband\u2019s career, have made it hard to believe that Hillary Clinton is a candidate deeply committed to ending the outsized influence of private power in the public\u2019s business.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Hillary Clinton\u2019s fault. It\u2019s her fate, as these stories just confirm a view that most Americans already have about most politicians, whether on the Right or Left\u2014that their first focus is on a favored few, even as they work hard to appear focused on the rest.\n\nClinton\u2019s recent promise to focus at least part of her campaign on the \u201cdysfunctional system\u201d of our government is a welcome response. But it may well be too late to pierce our veil of cynicism.\n\nThe Clintons have lived the life of American nobility. Privilege\u2014hard fought and at great price\u2014is now part of the brand. In the face of these charges, whether ultimately proven or not, it will be difficult to make believable the idea that responsiveness to privilege first is not the norm.\n\nTrue, Nixon went to China, and Johnson passed civil rights legislation. But neither ran campaigns on the promise that they would be fundamentally different from how most had come to see them. A campaign is not the time to reinvent yourself\u2014as Jimmy Carter, and George H.W. Bush (41) both discovered.\n\nIf Clinton is not the nominee, then the argument for a Republican reformer is even stronger. If she is defeated in the primary, it will be because this skepticism has boiled over in the Democratic Party, as well. The defeat of Clinton would give the victor the air of an unstoppable reformer, just at a time when Americans are increasingly desperate for someone to address \u201ccorruption in the federal government.\u201d (That was issue #2 on Gallup\u2019s Top 10 for the next president in 2012).\n\nThe only way the GOP could check that momentum would be to field a reformer of its own. Otherwise, the party risks a rout if the nominee succeeds convincing voters that a Democratic administration would be the Waterloo for K Street lobbyists.\n\nSo how could a Republican take up this issue? Isn\u2019t the Republican Party the party of big money?\n\nWithin the G.O.P. grassroots, there is a strong sense that crony capitalism is a real problem that is only compounded by our current system of campaign finance. Moreover, there is a sense that these cronies are not necessarily conservatives.\n\nLiberals like to paint Republicans as married to money. And indeed, the party has done much to complete that sketch. Certainly the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is a strong proponent of lifting all limits to campaign contributions while removing whatever remaining regulations there are on the way campaigns are funded. And the Dave Brat wing of the Republican Party has already effectively charged its leadership with living more on Wall Street than on Main Street, claiming Eric Cantor\u2019s scalp in the process.\n\nBut within the Grand Old Party grassroots, there is a strong sense that crony capitalism is a real problem that is only compounded by our current system of campaign finance. Moreover, there is a sense that these cronies are not necessarily conservatives.\n\nIn New Hampshire, candidate Lindsey Graham recently said \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose a democracy if we don\u2019t have some control over the money. The most influential people in the country are gonna be the ones with the most money.\u201d\n\nThe New Hampshire Rebellion\u2014a New Hampshire based grassroots group organizing to press candidates on the issue of corruption\u2014is collecting a long list of similar views by most of Graham\u2019s potential competitors.\n\nThese candidates are responding to a well-developed sense that something has gone off the rails in the way we fund campaigns in America. And it has led a former United States Senate candidate in the New Hampshire Republican primary, Jim Rubens, to propose an interesting hybrid between reform and deregulation, which might well prove to be the model for a reformer on the right.\n\nIn Rubens\u2019 plan, the first fifty dollars of everyone\u2019s taxes would be rebated to voters to pay for vouchers that could be used to fund political campaigns. But the plan also includes a provision to remove all limits on campaign contributions, so candidates for Congress could choose whether to fund their campaigns with small contributions or large.\n\nThis change would kill the SuperPAC (who wants to give to a .org when you can give to a candidate directly), but public funding (which is what these vouchers are) would empower candidates who wish to run free of big money.\n\nCandidates could thus choose whether to fund with the few or the many. And the public in turn would choose whether to elect candidates who fund with the few or they many.\n\nRubens\u2019 idea gives a reform Republican a chance to stand strong on the side of deregulation, while, at the same time, offering voters a glimpse of a system not dominated by large contributors. Of course, it\u2019s not clear whether candidates would opt into small or large contributions, but Rubens\u2019 proposal would at least give them the choice.\n\nAnd in a presidential race in which voters (especially in New Hampshire) are increasingly disgusted by the overwhelming role that money is playing in politics, this innovative hybrid could be a way for Republicans to reignite the spirit of Teddy Roosevelt, just at a time when America has finally had it with the modern version of Boss Tweed.\n\nAs a Democrat, I take comfort in recognizing just how unlikely it is that the Republicans will see the return\u2014to them and to the Republic\u2014that would come from their rediscovering their own reform roots.\n\nTo hear some of them speak, it\u2019s as if they don\u2019t even recognize that the savior of the Republican Right\u2014Ronald Reagan\u2014would never have left California but for the public funding of elections. No elected official in American political history benefited more from public funding than Reagan, who ran three national campaigns on the public\u2019s dime.\n\nAnd thus too did the Reagan wing of the Republican Party also benefit from public funding.\n\nAll of that is of course forgotten now, with the leadership of the Republican Party seemingly committed to the idea of the Sheldon Adelson Primary. But that doesn\u2019t change the basic facts: that never has the Right had a stronger reason to raise the reformer flag.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:55.587+0000"}

This seems to be the thinking of a group of powerful men and women\u2014racetrack owners, bankers, media barons, chicken magnates, hedge funders (and their spouses). Some of them have net worths that can eclipse the GDPs of small countries.\n\nRead more exclusive data stories at Vocativ\n\nLarry Noble, senior counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, told The Daily Beast that it\u2019s a common practice among a small number of people.\n\n\u201cSome of them will say they believe in the process, but the truth is you usually see them giving to people who will be most helpful to them if [the politician] gets into office,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not necessarily Republicans or Democrats, they are business people first.\u201d\n\nSome of them said personal connections are driving the double donations. Many work in industries that depend on the federal government for their continued operation. A few have had brushes with the law. One donor said he\u2019s soured on Hillary, and is now on Team Jeb. Another claimed that he gave to Clinton by mistake.\n\nJohn Tyson, chairman of Tyson Foods, is a long-time\u2014and promiscuous\u2014political player. This year alone, his company spent half a million dollars lobbying Congress on everything from immigration reform and fuel taxes to food safety regulations. He himself has given $25,000 each to the political action committees supporting Clinton\u2019s and Bush\u2019s 2016 candidacies, according to the data parsed by Vocativ.\n\nVocativ\n\nIn the late 1990s Tyson was embroiled in political scandal when then-Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy was accused of illegally accepting gifts from major food corporations\u2014several of which were given by Tyson, then a senior employee. Espy was acquitted, and John Tyson was granted immunity in exchange for his cooperation.\n\nThe company eventually paid a $6 million settlement to the government, and a Tyson Foods employee was sentenced to prison and their lobbyist was fined. (Both were later pardoned by President Clinton.)\n\n\n\nUntil not too long ago, David Stevens, the CEO of the real estate lobbying group the Mortgage Bankers Association, was in the government himself. Stevens served in the Obama administration as the assistant secretary for housing and as Federal Housing Administration (FHA) commissioner at the Department of Housing and Urban Development from July 2009 to April 2011.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s completely onboard with his fellow administration alum.\n\n\u201cI want to focus on candidates who best represent issues of housing and issues important to me and are not extreme, especially on the social issues that are important to me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhile [Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush] don\u2019t make commitments, obviously, I want to make sure my views are presented to them.\u201d\n\nStevens has given $2,700 to Hillary For America and $1,000 to Jeb 2016. He said he has watched with great concern about the increased polarization of both parties.\n\nBut at the end of the day, Stevens conceded it\u2019s also about access.\n\n\u201cWhile [Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush] don\u2019t make commitments, obviously, I want to make sure my views are presented to them, because they are considered more center-left or center-right,\u201d he said.\n\nRichard Parsons, the former head of Time Warner and now a senior adviser at Providence Equity Partners Inc., has donated the maximum $2,700 to both the Clinton and Bush presidential campaigns.\n\nVocativ\n\nHis r\u00e9sum\u00e9 reflects dual political loyalties.\n\nHe\u2019s served every Republican president since Richard Nixon and in 1997 was appointed to a task force by President George W. Bush to help study the best way to overhaul social security.\n\nHowever, he also advised then-President-Elect Obama as part of the Economic Transition Team in 2008. Parsons did not return attempts for comment.\n\nJames R. Borynack, the owner of Wally Findlay Galleries\u2014noted for its long history and expertise in European art\u2014was shy about saying why he wasn\u2019t choosing sides.\n\n\u201c[Borynack] has no detailed comments at this time, other than to support both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush equally as presidential candidates,\u201d a spokeswoman said.\n\nTwo Barclays employees have each donated $2,700\u2014the legal maximum\u2014to both the Clinton and Bush campaigns. One is Brett Tejpaul, a managing director at Barclays Capital who has also given $25,000 to the Jeb-affiliated super-PAC Right to Rise. The other is Robert Foresman, head of Barclays\u2019s business in Russia.\n\nForesman\u2019s Russia ties include the state-owned energy company that is one of\n\nPutin\u2019s biggest levers against the West. Russia\u2019s state-owned Gazprom provides critical gas to nearly two dozen European countries\u2014and has shut off energy to countries in dispute with Russia. In the early 2000s, Foresman was nominated as a candidate to the board of directors of Gazprom, but was never actually appointed to the board, according to the company\u2019s website.\n\nDouble donors Shawn Seipler, CEO of the nonprofit Clean the World Global, and textile magnate James Richman both make issues of economic justice central to their public presence. Richman is part of the Patriotic Millionaires, a left-leaning group of more than 200\u2014you guessed it\u2014millionaires who vow to support legislation to reduce income inequality.\n\nMichael Granoff, a principal at Maniv Energy Capital, was once a strong supporter of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. Granoff worked on Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in the early \u201990s and donated to Hillary Clinton\u2019s Senate and 2008 presidential campaign.\n\nBut Granoff but has since soured on the Democratic Party\u2019s foreign policy decisions\u2014particularly on Iran. And that\u2019s led to a change of heart about supporting the former secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI have nothing but continuing admiration for Hillary Clinton and her lifetime commitment to serving the public,\u201d he wrote in a February The Times of Israel blog post. \u201cBut she deeply disappointed me recently when she aligned herself with the Administration\u2019s threat to veto a Congressional bill to strengthen Iranian sanctions.\u201d\n\nGranoff said his post only rings more true now. He\u2019s made his devotion to Jeb clear by donating $2,700 to his campaign and $25,000 to Right to Rise, according to Vocativ\u2019s analysis of donors\u2019 data.\n\nThe mix of donations also exposed a seemingly common practice of wealthy individuals donating at the request of clients and friends.\n\nOne Wall Street donor, who asked to remain anonymous because he considered the donation to Hillary \u201cembarrassing,\u201d said he gave money to her Senate race after a bundler friend asked him for a contribution. He noted he asked the bundler friend to donate to a Republican in return.\n\nVocativ\n\nRobert Burlington, a prominent Florida attorney whose firm counts Exxon Mobil, Union Labor Life Insurance Company, and Merck as clients, told The Daily Beast that his donations to the candidates also had more to do with personal relationships than politics.\n\n\u201cMy donations arose from a request from a client (Clinton) and from a friend (Bush), rather than my affiliation with either party. But for the relationships with my client and my friend, respectively, I would not have donated to any candidate,\u201d he said, adding that he and his wife prefer to donate to children\u2019s charities.\n\nBurlington said that while he doesn\u2019t plan to give any more money to any candidate, he will quietly root for Bush.\n\n\u201cHe was a strong leader of Florida while he was our state\u2019s governor, and he has integrity,\u201d he said. \u201cI will not be too disappointed, however, if Hillary Clinton is elected because she has relevant experience and we will benefit from having a woman as president.\u201d\n\nAt least one donor initially claimed to not remember the Clinton donation.\n\n\u201cI never donated to Hillary,\u201d said Bradford Freeman, a major fundraiser for both George W. Bush presidential campaigns.\n\nReminded of his $2,300 donation in 2007, he said, \u201cWell, that would have been Hillary against Obama [in the primary]\u2026 I don\u2019t recall, but I may have.\u201d\n\nIn fairness, his one time donation to Hillary might be forgettable after the $1 million he gave Right to Rise.\n\nFreeman, whose investment firm Freeman Spogli won a $50 million commitment from the Florida pension system during Bush\u2019s tenure (and paid the former governor $45,000 for a speech after he left office, according to The New York Times ), told The Daily Beast he was all in for the former Florida governor.\n\nVocativ\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known Jeb for a long time. He\u2019s seen two successful terms as governor of Florida. I believe in him and I support him. I think he\u2019d make a great president,\u201d he said.\n\nRandall Dee \u201cR.D.\u201d Hubbard, a business executive in the horse racing business, credited\u2014or blamed\u2014his 2008 donation to Hillary Clinton on former New Mexico governor Bill Richardson.\n\n\u201cI would say I did not agree with her policies, and Gov. Richardson was a friend, and he requested a donation, which I gave,\u201d Hubbard said. \u201cAs far as 2016, I am one hundred percent behind Jeb Bush.\u201d\n\nBut Bush might not find Hubbard\u2019s support as straightforward. The former governor of Florida is praised for his work clamping down on Florida\u2019s illegal drug trade. Hubbard, meanwhile, saw his New Mexico racetrack tied to a money-laundering scheme by one of Mexico\u2019s most violent drug cartels. In 2012, federal authorities raided Hubbard\u2019s Ruidoso Downs racetrack and seized dozens of horses, whose financial backers allegedly had ties to the bloody Los Zetas cartel. Several cartel members were ultimately sentenced to prison in connection with the scheme.\n\n\u2014with additional reporting by Alexa Corse, Tim Mak, and Tal Reznik\n\nAn earlier version of this story noted two Tyson\u2019s employees were sentenced to prison. Only one was sentenced to prison.\n\n", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:56.187+0000"}

The doctor turned politician was addressing a group of more than 100 men and women, most of whom were black, on Chicago\u2019s South Side, reminiscing about his upbringing in a rough environment. \u201cI saw people lying in the street with bullet holes. The same types of things you see here in Chicago.\u201d\n\nFor the last four decades, Republicans have performed dismally among black voters, perhaps because the candidates trotted out each election cycle are almost always blindingly white. But the GOP\u2019s party platform has certain things in common with the average black voter\u2014conservative beliefs on social issues, for one.\n\nThe connection between the two\u2014African Americans and the Republican Party, which many black voters believe to be their mortal enemy\u2014was perhaps no more apparent than on Sunday in an empty lot that will soon be home to a community center, thanks to the faith-based entrepreneurial spirit of Pastor Corey Brooks. That\u2019s where the faithful gathered, and that\u2019s where Brooks introduced Carson to his flock.\n\n\u201cDr. Carson will take some questions,\u201d Brooks announced. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s a pretty courageous thing to do here on the South Side of Chicago, where you never know when someone\u2019s going to pop off at the mouth.\u201d\n\nThe crowd laughed.\n\nCarson is the second presidential candidate to visit Brooks\u2019s New Beginnings Church, situated in the city\u2019s Woodlawn neighborhood and just down the street from a particularly violent housing complex\u2014one hell of a distinction for a city with a murder rate as high as Chicago\u2019s. Last month, Rand Paul spoke at the church, and Brooks has invited all active presidential candidate to make the trip down to 6620 South Martin Luther King Drive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really pushing hard to get Jeb [Bush] down here,\u201d Brooks told me after Carson\u2019s speech.\n\nThe latest Bush to run for president would certainly be a big get, but considering it isn\u2019t every day that Republicans run around in President Obama\u2019s territory, any presidential candidate showing their face on South King should be a spectacle. Even so, Carson\u2019s visit prompted a minuscule media response. One of the only video cameras present for his remarks was operated by a public access TV station, and Carson\u2019s entire entourage was small enough to fit into an SUV.\n\n\u201cWhy do people burn their own neighborhoods down? Because there\u2019s no economic development going on.\u201d\n\nA darling among conservative media, Carson isn\u2019t a household name for the average member of Brooks\u2019s congregation. Not that it matters to some in the black community, including one man who asked Carson about media coverage in Baltimore and Ferguson after the deaths of Freddie Gray and Mike Brown.\n\n\u201cCarnage and discord, that\u2019s what sells,\u201d Carson said.\n\nIn his remarks to the crowd, peppered with plenty of references to his Christian beliefs, Carson addressed the protests, riots, uprising, movement, or whatever you want to call it that has taken hold as national attention has shifted to the matter of black men being killed by police officers.\n\n\u201cWhy do people burn their own neighborhoods down? Because there\u2019s no economic development going on,\u201d Carson said, before adding what three years ago would have been a stinging soundbite against Obama. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change, but there\u2019s not a lot of hope.\u201d\n\nCarson went on to describe a six-month, tax-free holiday that would allow corporations to bring money earned overseas back to U.S. banks without consequences from the IRS. The policy statement, one of the few specifics offered by any of the dozen-plus people running for the most powerful position in the world, was met with a murmur. But an addendum to the holiday did garner quite a bit of applause: Ten percent of the returning overseas corporate cash\u2014which Carson has pegged at $2 trillion\u2014would have to be used for \u201cthe creation of jobs for people on welfare and who are unemployed.\u201d\n\nFor all his talk of bootstraps, Carson joined scores of Republicans and Democrats before him in promising money\u2014this time from corporations and not the government\u2014in helping to improve the dire economic circumstances in the black community. A 25-year veteran of the Chicago Police Department in the audience on Sunday agreed with Carson\u2019s assessment that the rage on display in Baltimore, Ferguson, and elsewhere has its roots in poverty. The cop, a black patrolman who works in the city\u2019s toughest neighborhoods, noted Carson\u2019s political covenant, as well.\n\n\u201cPoliticians know what the public wants to hear, and they come out here and tell you exactly that,\u201d said the cop, who didn\u2019t want to give his name because, well, \u201cthis is Chicago,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis right here,\u201d he said dismissively of Carson\u2019s visit, \u201cthis was nothing.\u201d\n\nNothing new. Except a new face. And some new politics. While Brooks is more than happy to introduce his congregation, and Woodlawn, and the South and West sides of Chicago, to Paul, Carson, and whoever else accepts the pastor\u2019s invitation, Brooks knows he is also challenged with opening people up to something that for decades has been taboo in the black community: supporting Republicans.\n\nMichael Jones, who made it for the tail end of Carson\u2019s remarks and stayed for a plate of food provided by workers and volunteers at Brooks\u2019s church, showed just how difficult that challenge may be.\n\n\u201cI vote Democrat,\u201d he said when asked if he would ever consider voting for a Republican.\n\n\u201cHillary?\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary, whoever. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cI live in a Democrat community. I vote Democrat.\u201d\n\nBy the time Jones made that comment, Ben Carson was long gone, his hood pass likely exchanged for a plane ticket.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:56.724+0000"}
{"entityId": 2012, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "President Obama\u2019s call to renew the VRA is DOA on Capitol Hill\u2014despite the best efforts of a conservative Republican congressman.\n\nWisconsin Republican Jim Sensenbrenner is nobody\u2019s idea of a pussycat. A combative conservative and former chair of the House Judiciary committee, he vowed more than a year ago to restore the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court in 2013 overturned a key section monitoring states that had been past offenders. He said the historic civil-rights legislation \u201cis vital to our commitment to never again permit racial prejudices in our electoral process.\u201d He promised action before the 2014 election.\n\nThere\u2019s no question that Sensenbrenner\u2019s commitment is real, but the legislative fix that he fashioned is stalled in Congress and going nowhere. This is despite the fact that one of his principle co-sponsors is Democratic Rep. John Lewis, a civil-rights icon who marched in Selma last weekend to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the VRA.\n\n\u201cHow can that be?\u201d President Obama pleaded in the speech he delivered at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge where Lewis was beaten and bloodied a half century ago. The VRA is \u201cone of the crowning achievements of our democracy,\u201d Obama said, noting that Presidents Reagan and George W. Bush signed its reauthorization when they were in office. A hundred members of Congress had come to Selma to honor those like Lewis who put their life on the line for the right to vote. He urged them to go back to Washington, gather four hundred more, \u201cand together, pledge to make it their mission to restore the law this year.\u201d\n\nWhat Obama politely didn\u2019t say is that the congressional showing was almost all Democrats. One of the few Republicans on hand, South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott, criticized Obama for mixing politics with symbolism by mentioning the stalled legislation. \u201cPolitics is about what\u2019s important to people, and what bothers people\u2014so when a politician like Tim Scott who comes from a state that\u2019s worse than Ferguson says politics shouldn\u2019t be introduced, that means he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d says David Bositis, formerly with the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, whose research focuses on the American black electorate.\n\nAsked whether the symbolism of Selma fifty years later might move Congress to act, Bositis said flatly, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, nothing\u2019s going to happen\u2026. On balance this is more of a problem for the Republican Party than the Democrats because the people who are being disenfranchised view the Republican Party as hostile to them. It\u2019s hurting the Republican Party.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe fact that one of the two major political parties is hostile to the rights of minority citizens is a very big deal\u2014and a lot of that hostility is in the center of gravity of the party, which is Southern whites.\u201d\n\nThe Supreme Court 5-4 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder in June of 2013 opened the door to a spate of voter ID laws. \u201cVoter suppression, that\u2019s the intent, but so few people vote in the United States,\u201d says Bositis, \u201cso all they\u2019re doing is reinforcing the idea that Republicans are hostile to minority groups.\u201d The GOP did very well in 2010 and 2014, but it had nothing to do with voter suppression, he says. Young people and minority voters typically have low turnout in non-presidential years.\n\nFor example, Ferguson is two-thirds black, yet a majority of voters in their local elections are white. \u201cOtherwise Ferguson would have a black government and a black police force, and if there was any justice in the world, they\u2019d be suppressing white people,\u201d Bositis says with a wry laugh.\n\nNo election outcomes will be changed with or without the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, he declares. Still, it\u2019s important. \u201cThe fact that one of the two major political parties is hostile to the rights of minority citizens is a very big deal\u2014and a lot of that hostility is in the center of gravity of the party, which is Southern whites.\u201d They\u2019re not wielding clubs and hoses anymore, he says, and they may not say anything overtly racist. They cloak their objections in states\u2019 rights. But Republicans not only have no incentive to update the VRA, they have a disincentive, he explains.\n\nTheir conservative supporters wouldn\u2019t like it if a restored VRA allowed the Justice Department to rule against all the new voter ID laws. Democrats would have to go a long way toward sanctioning voter ID requirements if they want GOP votes for a reauthorized VRA, and even then Republican cooperation is unlikely. Sensenbrenner has been in Congress since 1979, and for decades was one of its most powerful members. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the influence he once had,\u201d says Bositis. \u201cHe\u2019s a John Boehner Republican, and the people who are calling the shots in the House are the people on the right.\u201d\n\nWhen Sensenbrenner unveiled his bipartisan bill last year, a right-wing blog noted that the veteran lawmaker had won \u201cpraise from far-left, Soros-connected race-hustling groups,\u201d and that he is working with \u201ca rogue\u2019s gallery of leftists\u201d to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act struck down by the Court. Sensenbrenner has witnessed firsthand the arc of history. He helped lead the negotiations in 1982 when reauthorization of the VRA cleared the House 389-24 and President Reagan signed it into law. A young lawyer named John Roberts in the White House counsel\u2019s office advised Reagan against signing the legislation, but other advisors saw opportunity.\n\nThe renewed law authorized majority minority districts, making it possible for more African-Americans to win elective office, and also allowing Republicans to make gains by moving black Democrats out of competitive districts, making those seats safer for the GOP. Sensenbrenner later led the effort for President Bush to sign a reauthorization of the VRA in 2006. The vote was 98 to zero in the Senate and 390-33 in the House.\n\nIn a rapidly changing America, the signals the GOP sends are as important as any legislation. Sensenbrenner told the Senate Judiciary Committee in 2013 that he didn\u2019t expect his career to include a third reauthorization of the VRA, \u201cbut I believe it is a necessary challenge. Voter discrimination still exists, and our progress toward equality should not be mistaken for a final victory.\u201d\n\nSomething would have to change radically on Capitol Hill for the third time to be the charm. No vote is expected in the House, and in the Senate, GOP leader Mitch McConnell won\u2019t bring up anything that could put his members on the spot. Politicians can savor the symbolism and forget the substance, at least for now.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:57.143+0000"}

You\u2019d be wrong.\n\nEvangelicals were supposed to hate Donald Trump.\n\nHis ostentatious wealth, his colorful language, his serial marriages\u2014he was supposed to be the anti-Huckabee, the candidate least appealing to conservative Christians and their reality TV-unfriendly sensibilities.\n\nThen there was Trump\u2019s cavalier discussion of his faith at the Ames, Iowa, Family Leadership Summit in July\u2014where he said he doesn\u2019t ask God for forgiveness.\n\nThe Washington Examiner\u2019s Byron York argued that comment would hurt him more than his disparagement of Senator John McCain\u2019s war record.\n\nAnd The New York Times noted that Trump\u2019s comments on his faith and multiple marriages \u201cprompted the most muttering and unease in the audience.\u201d\n\nFast-forward a month, and that looks like little more than misguided concern trolling. In reality, many top evangelical leaders admire Trump\u2019s chutzpah\u2014and his conservative conversion story.\n\nPam Olsen, who helms an influential evangelical prayer group in Florida, said she was particularly impressed by his opposition to abortion.\n\n\u201cHis story of turning from pro-choice to pro-life is a very good story,\u201d she said, \u201cand with what happened with the Planned Parenthood videos coming out, we are praying as leaders in the evangelical movement that multitudes of people would have that same story that Donald Trump has, to become aware of what abortion really means and to become pro-life.\u201d\n\nPoll numbers show the real estate mogul is leading the field among evangelical voters, and that his support from that key demographic went up after his controversial debate performance .\n\nIn fact, a PPP poll of Iowa voters taken shortly after the debate showed the lady-ogling WWE alum doubling Mike Huckabee\u2019s support among evangelicals. DOUBLING. HUCKABEE.\n\nLook: This shouldn\u2019t have surprised anyone.\n\nTurns out, Trump has been courting the evangelical vote for quite some time. The Donald J. Trump Foundation has made donations to evangelical groups like Iowa\u2019s The Family Leader ( $10,000 in 2013, PDF), Samaritan\u2019s Purse ( $10,000 in 2013, PDF) and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association ( $100,000 in 2012, PDF), according to IRS forms posted on Guidestar.org.\n\nEarlier this month, Graham\u2019s son, Franklin, praised Trump\u2019s debate performance on Facebook.\n\n\u201c[H]e\u2019s shaking up the Republican party and the political process overall. And it needs shaking up!\u201d Franklin Graham wrote.\n\nBut beyond the financial investment, the conservative Christian voters who play a key role in helping Republican candidates win primaries and general elections like him for some pretty understandable reasons. And that helps explain why his candidacy has had staying power that leaves many beltway graybeards scratching their heads\u2014and why he could be an even bigger problem for the Republican establishment than some expect.\n\n\u201cI think long before anyone thought that he would seriously run for president, he was making outreaches to evangelicals and Catholics who are involved in the political process.\u201d \u2014 Johnnie Moore, former senior vice president of Liberty University\n\nA clever observer could have foretold all of this by watching Trump\u2019s appearance at Liberty University on September 24, 2012 . The college\u2014a powerhouse of conservative influence where virtually every Republican presidential contender speaks\u2014invited Trump to deliver one of their convocation addresses, and he agreed, taking care to note that he waived his classy, hefty, yuuuge speaking fee.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr., the son of the college\u2019s late founder, Jerry Falwell, introduced Trump to raucous applause, calling him \u201cone of the great visionaries of our time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere at Liberty University, we plan to start replacing our oldest dorms in the dorm circle with residential towers in January and I think we need a Trump Tower or two here on campus, don\u2019t you?\u201d he said to laughter and cheers.\n\nFalwell also praised Trump\u2019s accomplishments in the political realm.\n\n\u201cIn 2011, after failed attempts by Senator John McCain and Hillary Clinton, Mr. Trump singlehandedly forced President Obama to release his birth certificate,\u201d he said without irony, drawing more applause.\n\nWhen Trump rose to speak\u2014his daffodil-yellow hair and eyebrows glowing against the stage\u2019s muted blue backdrop\u2014students' cheers were lengthy and loud. A school press release said the event drew a record audience, even though convocation attendance was mandatory for students. Trump praised Jerry Falwell, described himself as \u201ca very proud Christian and a real Christian,\u201d and reminisced about his Sunday school days. And he even sparked a minor controversy by advising students to \u201cget even\u201d if they were wronged in the business world.\n\n\u201cI always say it but I won\u2019t say it to you because this is a different audience,\u201d he continued, of his advice that students extract revenge from their adversaries.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t want to get even, do you?\u201d he asked, shaking his hand from side to side as the audience laughed. \u201cYeah, I think you do.\u201d\n\nAnd he doubled down, giving more life tips that students at the conservative school would have been unlikely to hear from another speaker in his spot.\n\n\u201cI always say, always have a prenuptial agreement,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut I won\u2019t say it here because you people don\u2019t get divorced, right? Nobody gets divorced! OK, so I will not say have a prenuptial agreement to anybody in this room! I just want to end\u2014who else would say that but Trump, right? See? I said I should say it, but I won\u2019t say it\u2014how do I get my point across without saying it, I just did it, right?\u201d\n\nAnd before Falwell dismissed students after Trump\u2019s speech, he made a prescient joke.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not too late to get back in the presidential race, is it?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s revenge comments drew critical coverage, but Liberty circled the wagons and sent their top leaders to make the rounds on Christian radio to defend the mogul\u2019s tip.\n\nJohnnie Moore, an author and consultant as well as former senior vice president of Liberty University, helped oversee Trump\u2019s visit. He said the mogul made an overwhelmingly good impression on the students and faculty. The event\u2019s organizers had expected Trump to leave immediately after the speech, but instead he made the rounds on campus, chatting up campus leaders, posing for pictures, and soaking it all in.\n\n\u201cHe wasn\u2019t in a hurry,\u201d said Moore. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t arrogant, he wasn\u2019t too busy for the community, he literally just stayed around all afternoon. It was really, really interesting.\u201d\n\nMoore added that other evangelical and conservative Catholic institutions had similar experiences with Trump in the years before he announced his presidential bid.\n\n\u201cI know many, many evangelical and Catholic organizations that have had that same experience with him,\u201d Moore said. \u201cI think long before anyone thought that he would seriously run for president, he was making outreaches to evangelicals and Catholics who are involved in the political process.\u201d\n\nBut he hasn\u2019t gotten to know all of them. Olsen, who helms the Florida Prayer Network, said she hasn\u2019t yet met the mogul, and she\u2019ll have at least one thing to say to him when she does.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say, \u2018Be wise and ask God\u2019s forgiveness!\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThat said, Olsen added that many evangelicals take heart in his shift from being ambivalent about abortion to being pro-life. Sin, forgiveness, and redemption are key to the evangelical view of how God works. And Trump, in his own way, exemplifies that. She added that there\u2019s an appeal in his eagerness to needle Republican Party leadership.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s holding the feet to the fire of the Republican Party, which isn\u2019t a bad thing,\u201d she said.\n\nRay Moore, the director of South Carolina-based Exodus Mandate (\u201ca Christian ministry to encourage and assist Christian families to leave Pharaoh\u2019s school system (i.e., government schools),\u201d per its site ), held a similar view. He won\u2019t endorse a candidate, but said Trump\u2019s appeal to evangelicals makes a lot of sense.\n\n\u201cThey get in office and they just give us the back of the hand as soon as they get elected,\u201d he said, referring to top Washington Republicans. \u201cLook at the Planned Parenthood issue, they can\u2019t seem to defund Planned Parenthood, and it\u2019s just amazing to watch that go on for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been hard on them, and I like that,\u201d he added.\n\nA bill to eliminate federal funding for Planned Parenthood would certainly draw a presidential veto. But it would also be a symbolic effort that conservatives say they would appreciate. So that puts congressional Republicans in a tight spot\u2014how much of their political capital do they expend on symbolic gestures? For many evangelicals, they haven't spent enough.\n\nThat includes Steve Scheffler, Iowa\u2019s Republican National Committeeman and the head of the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, who said that same frustration\u2014enflamed by the failure of congressional Republicans to send Obama a bill that defunded Planned Parenthood\u2014is common among Trump\u2019s backers.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re looking for an outlet to vent their frustrations,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many evangelical voters, Trump is that outlet.\n\nBut for others, he\u2019s still an enigma.\n\n\u201cI find it surprising, but then again, I tell myself it\u2019s very early on in the race,\u201d said Cindy Costa, South Carolina\u2019s Republican National Committeewoman.\n\n\u201cI think he would be much better than Hillary Clinton or any of the Democratic contenders,\u201d she continued. \u201cGod works in strange ways.

He didn\u2019t change his position. He didn\u2019t run around giving interviews saying he\u2019s now against the Palestinian state.\u201d\n\nSo which is it?\n\nIn reality, Netanyahu\u2019s position on this issue is much more complicated than Dermer lets on. The claim rates Mostly False.\n\nHere\u2019s what Netanyahu said in a video interview published the day before the March 17 general election on NRG, a right-leaning Israeli news website:\n\n\u201cI think that anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state today and evacuate lands is giving attack grounds to the radical Islam against the state of Israel,\u201d Netanyahu said. \u201cThis is the genuine reality that has been created here in the past few years. Those who do not understand that bury their heads in the sand. The left-wing parties do it, bury their heads in the sand, time and again.\u201d\n\nThe reporter asked, \u201cBut if you are the prime minister, a Palestinian state will not arise?\u201d\n\n\u201cIndeed,\u201d Netanyahu said. He went on:\n\n\u201cAn international initiative will be presented to us, to return to 1967 borders, to divide Jerusalem. Those are real things. It is going to happen. We need to form a strong, firm national government, headed by Likud [his party], to push those pressures away.\u201d\n\nReports from The New York Times, the Post and others cast these comments as a departure from his 2009 speech at Bar Ilan University, when Netanyahu endorsed a two-state solution\u2014with caveats\u2014to the conflict. Secretary of State John Kerry had been working on peace talks, of which the agreement of two states is the desired result, but those fell through last year.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t say there would never be a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s hard to know Netanyahu\u2019s true position, because his rhetoric has been inconsistent. Jonathan Schanzer, Foundation for Defense of Democracies vice president for research and author of books on the conflict, offered several notes of context.\n\nFirst, and perhaps most important, Netanyahu\u2019s support for the two-state solution has always been tepid, Schanzer said. In his first term, which started in 1997, he opposed Palestinian statehood. The switch came at the university speech in 2009, and he reaffirmed in October 2014 his support for \u201ca vision of peace of two states for two peoples based on mutual recognition and rock solid security arrangements on the ground\u201d during a visit with Obama at the White House.\n\nFor Netanyahu to say now, unequivocally, that there would be no Palestinian state during his time in office may seem to indicate that he is against it on principle, Schanzer said, \u201cbut he didn\u2019t say there would never be a two-state solution.\u201d\n\nTo Schanzer, that is a fine distinction. Netanyahu always seemed reluctant to be part of the peace talks brokered by the United States, but he showed up anyway, Schanzer said. For him to acknowledge how poorly the talks have gone, and how unlikely they are to improve given the dwindling tenures of all leaders involved, \u201cis actually a moment of honesty,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\n***\n\nNetanyahu\u2019s objections to a nuclear agreement with Iran were another topic on the Sunday news shows. On Fox News Sunday, conservative pundit Liz Cheney, the daughter of former vice president Dick Cheney, claimed Obama is going too far to cut a deal with the Iranian government at the expense of America\u2019s Israeli allies.\n\nTo that point, she said, international nuclear observers have already accused Iran of breaking the rules of its nuclear agreements.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, or IAEA, \u201clast month said the Iranians are not currently living up to their obligations,\u201d Cheney said.\n\nThe key to understanding Cheney\u2019s claim is knowing that she\u2019s not talking about the interim agreement among Iran, the United States, and five other world powers\u2014known as the Joint Plan of Action. According to the IAEA, Iran has not violated that agreement.\n\nBut the IAEA reported in February that it could not confirm that Iran was fully complying with the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty because Iran did not provide enough information for the agency to clarify outstanding questions.\n\n\u201cThe Agency is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn March 10 remarks to the IAEA Board of Governors, Director General Yukiya Amano elaborated on the report\u2019s findings: \u201cThe IAEA is able to verify that while all of Iran\u2019s declared nuclear material and activities are peaceful and in accordance with their safeguard agreements, they are not able to make the same assurances about undeclared material and activities.\n\n\u201cThe Agency remains concerned about the possible existence in Iran of undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related organizations, including activities related to the development of a nuclear payload for a missile,\u201d the report said.\n\nIran\u2019s IAEA envoy told Iranian media that the agency\u2019s claims were baseless, according to Reuters.\n\nGiven the context of Cheney\u2019s comments, people could assume she was talking about the Joint Plan of Action. Because that clarification is needed, we rate her statement Mostly True.\n\nLauren Carroll contributed to this report.

{"entityId": 2015, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The former Florida governor tried out his best sunny persona this weekend in New Hampshire\u2014and in return he got angry voters calling out \u201cRepublicans in Name Only.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s strategy in New Hampshire seemed simple: appeal to the steely primary voters, both fans and doubters, by killing them with kindness.\n\nThe former governor headed to the Granite State this weekend, touting his record in Florida and courting comparatively moderate Republican primary voters.\n\nBut despite his affable demeanor and mild manners, Jeb Bush generates the kind of ire that only Hillary Clinton can.\n\nAt the Saint Anselm College Politics and Eggs breakfast on Friday morning, Bush presented himself as Mr. Nice Guy. He chuckled with attendees about his famous last name, signed the traditional wooden eggs, and bemoaned the acrimoniousness of American politics.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m sick and tired of the political game where you push someone down and make yourself look better,\u201d he said, drawing lengthy applause. \u201cIt\u2019s time to reverse that.\u201d\n\nAnd he exuded Pollyanna-esque levels of optimism.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe that we\u2019re on the verge of the greatest time to be alive,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly believe that.\u201d\n\nAfter a short question-and-answer session, the former governor was mobbed by well-wishers looking to get autographs and take selfies with him.\n\n\u201cThe candidates that are looking for New Hampshire to save them are those candidates who support Common Core and think that they can get elected because they have a famous, dynastic name.\u201d\n\nThen he squeezed into a back room for a slightly chaotic press conference and zipped over to the First in the Nation Republican Leadership Summit at the Crowne Plaza hotel in Nashua.\n\nHis speech there, touching on the same themes as his breakfast address\u2014the possibility of dramatic economic growth, the importance of restoring America\u2019s influence on world affairs, and the problem with negative politicking\u2014drew some skepticism.\n\n\u201cI think after the last couple of elections, a lot of us are not looking for a Republican in name only,\u201d said a woman who asked the rambling first question after the speech, \u201cand somebody that claims to be a conservative. And when I say a conservative, I mean a free marketer, somebody who believes in capitalism. I\u2019m just hoping that your candidacy and your platform is going to be more, uh, not trying to appeal to everybody and please everybody and end up pleasing no one. Can you comment on that?\u201d\n\nBush responded by directing her to his record (\u201cIt\u2019s a conservative record, it\u2019s not a Republican in name only record\u201d) and saying he doesn\u2019t feel like he\u2019s getting coronated.\n\nBut if skepticism like this takes root\u2014and it certainly might\u2014it could damn Bush\u2019s nascent campaign. While preliminary polls look OK for the former governor, former U.S. senator Judd Gregg notes that the field is wide open and that anyone could surge in the coming months.\n\nOne Dartmouth University student, Brian Chen, said he thinks a Bush surge is highly unlikely.\n\n\u201cI think his team has severely underestimated how hostile grassroots Republicans are to him,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that he really does not represent what we stand for.\u201d\n\nChen wasn\u2019t there for Bush\u2019s speech but said it got poor reviews.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only heard bad things,\u201d he said. \u201cUniversally panned. Even people who like him don\u2019t think he did a particularly good job.\u201d\n\nAnd Dan Hynes, a member of New Hampshire Young Republicans, said he wasn\u2019t impressed with the former governor\u2019s presence in the state.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, he has the name recognition,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s also going to have to overcome bad name recognition. And I\u2019m not seeing a ground campaign much.\u201d\n\nFergus Cullen, a former chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party who hosted a house party for Bush, said the former governor made a good impression in his one-on-one talks with attendees.\n\nBut he also said Bush hadn\u2019t been in the state for 15 years before that and that other contenders\u2014like Senator Marco Rubio and Governor Chris Christie\u2014have put in significantly more time with voters and party officials.\n\n\u201cJeb is really starting from scratch,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have an existing organization that he inherited or built. Even the folks who helped his brother\u2019s campaign\u2014that was 15 years ago, 16 years ago, and that organization doesn\u2019t exist anymore.\u201d\n\nIn short, Bush has a lot of skepticism to quell. So he\u2019s being really nice. While other Republican presidential contenders lobbed doom-and-gloom messages on how the globe will be lucky to survive the Obama presidency, Bush geeked out about how science says his grandkids will live to 130. He talked about falling in love with his wife when he was 17. He came off as wonky and avuncular. He was warm, fuzzy, and power-affable. And, naturally, people still hate him.\n\nIn Nashua on Sunday\u2014in the same hotel ballroom where Bush told Republican activists that love at first sight is real\u2014a small, dedicated cadre of grassroots conservative activists gathered together in hopes of nipping his White House dreams in the bud.\n\nFor Bush, inspiring flamboyant grassroots vitriol is the norm. During his CPAC speech in February, a group of Tea Party activists and Rand Paul fans made national headlines when they marched out under a Gadsden flag.\n\nSunday morning\u2019s grassroots summit, hosted by a group called the 603 Alliance, brought together activists who shared the CPAC party-crashers\u2019 complaints.\n\nFran Wendelboe, a former member of the New Hampshire House, said the group hopes to gather conservative voters together at an October caucus and get them to agree to coalesce behind one candidate. She also said Donald Trump filled out their candidate survey and that Governor Rick Perry\u2019s aides promised her that he\u2019ll send in his answers shortly. If the 603 Alliance can consolidate the RINO-hunter vote, winning New Hampshire and snagging the Republican nomination could be much tougher for Jeb. Big if.\n\nThe 603 Alliance meeting had upward of 100 attendees by my count, and it kicked off with live music from a rockabilly band. The John Birch Society\u2014long banished from mainstream conservative circles\u2014had a booth there with literature touting Agenda 21 conspiracy theories. State Representative Bill O\u2019Brien, former state speaker of the House, jabbed at Bush with vim.\n\n\u201cThe candidates that are looking for New Hampshire to save them are those candidates who support Common Core and think that they can get elected because they have a famous, dynastic name,\u201d he said, drawing laughter and hearty boos from the audience. \u201cThose candidates are the candidates who hug Barack Obama because he showers federal dollars on their state. Those are the candidates who say one thing about illegal immigrants in New Hampshire, and they\u2019ll go back to Florida and give a speech in Spanish on Univision in which they say something else\u2014the opposite.\u201d\n\nThat last comment was likely an allusion to a Breitbart News story that inaccurately translated comments Rubio made on Univision. The conservative news outlet initially reported that the senator defended the president\u2019s executive action on immigration on the Spanish-language network. The site later ran an article saying that its initial piece was wrong because it had misunderstood his Spanish.\n\nBut that nuance seemed lost on the booing New Hampshire crowd.\n\nJack Kimball, who formerly chaired the state\u2019s Republican Party, gave a speech that was a little less demure. He said that \u201cAgenda 21, regional planning, NGOs\u201d are \u201ctrying to control all of us, rack \u2019em, pack \u2019em, stack \u2019em.\u201d\n\nHe also criticized FISA courts, the Patriot Act, police militarization, and the Environmental Protection Agency, which he half-jokingly dubbed \u201cour own terrorist organization.\u201d And he criticized national media coverage of the police shooting and protests in Ferguson, Missouri, this past summer.\n\nKimball also praised one event attendee for going to Cliven Bundy\u2019s ranch last summer to participate in the standoff against federal agents. The crowd gave that man a standing ovation.\n\nWhile fighting Bush will never be as exciting for Tea Partiers as fighting Clinton or Obama, it sure gets them out of bed on a Sunday morning.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:58.308+0000"}

The 2010 ruling launched a thousand super PACs, this cycle, a spring 2015 billionaires\u2019 primary as multiple candidates vie for the big bucks.\n\nWhile there aren\u2019t many Washington Republicans joining Graham\u2019s call for a constitutional amendment, he\u2019s in good company around the country, where large majorities of voters support an amendment to rein in what Citizens United unleashed.\n\nAll 54 Senate Democrats in the last Congress supported a Democracy for All amendment; every Republican opposed it, including Graham.\n\nGraham\u2014who is looking to distinguish himself in a crowded primary\u2014is no doubt seeing the same polls Clinton likely factored into her announcement tour.\n\nShe included a constitutional amendment in her top four priorities.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to need real reform from people participating in the system that isn\u2019t working, but activists are going to want to see more than speeches.\u201d \u2014 Karen Hobert-Flynn, senior vice president at Common Cause\n\nPolling by Democracy Corps and pollster Stan Greenberg finds that Americans by an overwhelming margin, 73 to 24 percent, back a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United, and that includes a 56 percent margin among Independents and a 26 percent margin among Republicans.\n\nStill, advocates of reform didn\u2019t see it coming when Clinton announced her support on her launch tour in Iowa, and they\u2019re fending off questions from skeptics about how hypocritical it is for Clinton to cast herself as a reformer while capitalizing on a system that allows her campaign to amass what could well be over a billion dollars.\n\nIt\u2019s more ironic than hypocritical, says Karen Hobert-Flynn, senior vice president at Common Cause. \u201cWe\u2019re going to need real reform from people participating in the system that isn\u2019t working, but activists are going to want to see more than speeches.\u201d\n\nThe current administration has talked a lot about the problem of money in politics, but has done little to change it.\n\nObama stood in the House chamber to deliver his State of the Union address the day after the Supreme Court handed down its Citizens United decision in January 2010.\n\nHis anger was palpable, though he spoke, he said, \u201cwith all due deference to separation of powers\u201d when he assailed the justices seated before him for having \u201creversed a century of law\u201d that he believed \u201cwill open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections\u2026. I don\u2019t think American elections should be bankrolled by America\u2019s most powerful interests or, worse, by foreign entities. They should be decided by the American people.\u201d\n\nCameras caught Justice Alito mouthing \u201cnot true,\u201d and fact-checkers said Obama exaggerated the potential for foreign influence.\n\nBut in the five years since that memorable scene, Obama\u2019s fears have been borne out, yet he hasn\u2019t done much beyond giving lip service to his objections.\n\nActivists were disappointed that he didn\u2019t use this year\u2019s State of the Union address to announce that he would sign an executive order to end dark money in federal contracting, using his executive powers to require federal contractors to reveal their contributions. It would be mostly prophylactic, that knowing they are required to report they would clean up their act.\n\nJust in the last month, Common Cause submitted 550,000 signatures to the White House asking for the executive order. An inquiry by The Daily Beast produced this response: \u201cNo updates on a potential EO, but we\u2019ve said in the past we support a constitutional amendment as well.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what Obama is waiting for. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any downside to his taking this minimal step. Amending the Constitution remains far out of reach, as it requires a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate, plus ratification by three-quarters of the states.\n\nIn the absence of anything more than speeches, voters are understandably cynical about the prospects for reform. \u201cHe mentions it, but there\u2019s no strong push,\u201d says Hobert-Flynn.\n\nAfter all, if Clinton and Obama were truly serious about the insidious role of money, wouldn\u2019t they be setting an example instead of setting new records for raising money?\n\nClinton\u2019s answer to that is she\u2019s playing by the rules that exist in order to have the power to change them. The problem with that sentence is it\u2019s the same response Obama has given, and if he leaves office without doing anything to confront Citizens United beyond an occasional rhetorical swipe, he becomes part of the problem. In the peculiar way politics works, perhaps Clinton\u2019s surprise embrace of a constitutional amendment will jolt the White House to get in on the action.

Jeb Bush is refusing to take Norquist\u2019s anti-tax pledge.\n\n\n\n\u201cJeb Bush, when he hears, \u2018Will you take the pledge?\u2019 he thinks the question is, \u2018Do you love your father?\u2019 He thinks this is referring to Dad\u2019s mistake,\" Norquist told The Daily Beast.\n\nNorquist, the influential head of Americans for Tax Reform and its famous no-taxes pledge, said this is what Jeb Bush told him when they sat down and discussed the matter in the early 2000s, when Jeb was governor. And it has been, he said, a Bush family issue.\n\nSince the mid-1980s, Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform has been pressuring lawmakers to sign the group\u2019s pledge to oppose tax increases.\n\nThis has spurred a decades-long history of bad blood between Norquist and the Bushes.

In 1990 The Sunday Times in London wrote of a \u201cmysterious American\" named Grover Norquist who had arrived in Edinburgh to aid Scottish conservatives, bragging to be \u201conly a footstep away from George Bush.\"\n\nBut after the no taxes promise had been broken, Norquist wrote in the conservative American Spectator that the elder Bush had been \u201ca failure as a party leader,\" and called Bush\u2019s 1992 campaign \u201cembarrassing.\u201d\n\nNorquist recalls being yelled at by a senior George H.W. Bush aide for trying to put language in the GOP platform acknowledging that raising taxes was a mistake during the 1992 election.\n\nEven George H.W. Bush had called his decision to raise taxes the biggest regret of his presidency, at least during that fateful campaign. But despite his father\u2019s own regret over the budget deal, Jeb continued to trumpet the compromise as recently as 2012.\n\n\u201cThe budget deal my dad did, with bipartisan support... created the spending restraint of the \u201990s,\u201d Jeb Bush told a group of reporters in 2012.\n\nJeb Bush has also said he would make a tradeoff that involves tax increases -- if the price was right.\n\n\u201cIf you could bring to me a majority of people to say that we are going to have $10 of spending cuts for $1 of revenue enhancement, put me in, coach,\u201d the former Florida governor said in 2012 before the House Budget Committee.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe problem is the 10 [dollars in spending cuts] never materializes,\u201d shot back the then-chairman, Republican Representative Paul Ryan.\n\nIn the same hearing, Jeb Bush told lawmakers, \u201cI don\u2019t believe you outsource your principles and convictions to people. I respect Grover\u2019s political involvement. He has every right to do it. But I never signed any pledge.\u201d\n\nGiven three opportunities to sign the pledge while running for governor in Florida, Jeb Bush declined.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s commitment not to sign an anti-tax pledge if he were to formally run for president was a point reiterated again via a spokesperson.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush, when he hears, \u2018Will you take the pledge?\u2019 he thinks the question is, \u2018Do you love your father?\u2019 He thinks this is referring to Dad\u2019s mistake,\u201d Norquist said.\n\n\u201cIf Governor Bush decides to move forward, he will not sign any pledges circulated by lobbying groups. His record on tax cuts is clear. He didn\u2019t raise taxes. He cut them every year as governor for a total of more than $19 billion in tax relief,\u201d said Jeb Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell. \u201cHe does not support raising taxes and believes cutting taxes and reforming the tax code will lead to greater economic growth and more prosperity for Americans.\u201d\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush made a similar point about the pledge when Parade magazine interviewed him for a cover story in 2012.\n\nIt\u2019s clear there\u2019s no love lost between the elder Bush and Norquist.\n\n\u201cThe rigidity of those pledges is something that I don\u2019t like. You know, the circumstances change and you can\u2019t be wedded to some formula by Grover Norquist\u2026 who the hell is Grover Norquist, anyway?\u201d the former president said.\n\nNorquist shot back, \u201cAsked to talk about anything in the world, he pipes up with, \u2018Who the hell is Grover Norquist?\u2019 \u2026 Uh, I\u2019ve never blurted out his name in the middle of the night. There is a sensitivity there.\u201d\n\nNorquist says he expects Jeb Bush to sign the anti-tax pledge, sooner or later.\n\n\u201cThe pledge looms large in his dad\u2019s history, and it ought not to be determinative, but I understand it, and that is why at the end of the day Jeb is a politician that learns, and will learn, he\u2019s a big mature guy,\u201d Norquist said.\n\nNorquist may have been encouraged to think this way by his experience with Jeb\u2019s brother, George W. Bush. In 1999 a spokesperson for the then-Texas governor said Bush would not sign Norquist\u2019s pledge. Just one day later, according to The Washington Post, George W. Bush signed a letter pledging not to raise taxes.\n\nPressed regarding Jeb Bush\u2019s positions on taxes, his aides did not directly respond to a question about whether Jeb Bush might make a general promise to voters more broadly not to raise taxes.\n\n\u201cThe smart move will be, and Jeb is a smart man, will be to move to a zone where he says\u2026 \u2018I\u2019m not filling out a commitment to any group, but let me promise you the voters I\u2019m not raising taxes,\u201d Norquist said. \u201cIt need not be [personal] because the way you honor your father is to learn from the mistakes, and this is exactly what his brother [George W. Bush] did.\u201d\n\nSome 88 percent of House and Senate Republicans have signed the pledge offered by Norquist\u2019s Americans for Tax Reform, as have 12 governors.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:59.319+0000"}
{"entityId": 2018, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The White House will hold its first ever Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders summit on Tuesday\u2014but Obama will not be there.\n\nPresident Obama will not attend the White House's own summit dedicated to Asian Americans Tuesday, the latest signal that he is neglecting the group in his second term, community advocates argue.\n\nAsian Americans are the fastest growing voter bloc in the United States, but the president appears uninterested in wooing the community now that he has no elections left to run.\n\nIn the president's seventh year in office, Asian American activists feel neglected by the White House\u2014even as the White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders holds its first summit Tuesday, drawing an expected attendance of 2,000 people.\n\n\"Him not appearing somewhere with the Asian American community during Asian American Heritage Month is neglect,\" said Floyd Mori, head of the APAICS, the non-profit arm of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. \"Since the last election, we haven't seen the access we've had before at the White House... Certainly with regard to appearing and meeting with Asian American groups, it has been sparse.\"\n\nPresident Obama will instead attend the Catholic-Evangelical Leadership Summit on Overcoming Poverty at Georgetown University on Tuesday. In all likelihood, his route from the White House will involve passing by George Washington University, where his own White House is holding a summit for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.\n\nHe won't be stopping.\n\n\"We are disappointed that as we celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage month, the President will not be at his own summit honoring Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders... nor any other community events scheduled for Heritage month,\" said Mee Moua, the executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice. \"We hope he will consider prioritizing AAPIs and make us part of his legacy. We look forward to working with the White House to make this a reality.\"\n\nThe White House Initiative on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders had asked for Obama to come address their summit, but were told that the president would not, Mori said.\n\nAsked by The Daily Beast, the White House did not say why the president would be absent.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the summit will be devoid of Obama representatives.\n\nThe White House summit boasts two panels with a number of cabinet officials, who will talk about how the Obama administration's actions have benefited the Asian American community.\n\n\u201cMore than 15 Cabinet Secretaries and Senior Administration officials look forward to participating in the White House Summit on AAPIs,\u201d said a White House spokesman. \"There is no doubt this administration... will continue to proactively engage AAPIs and work to expand opportunity and address issues facing their communities. President Obama looks forward to continuing that engagement.\u201d\n\nBut the summit\u2019s lineup also serves to remind that for the first time in 15 years, the cabinet does not feature an Asian American member\u2014something that has been true since the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki last May.\n\nAnd while President Obama regularly appears at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s annual events, he has been conspicuously absent from comparable events for the AAPI community.\n\n\n\nSince taking office, he has attended all six of the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation\u2019s annual events, and confirmed for five of the last six Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute galas. The analogous group for the Asian American community, APAICS, has been able to feature him as a speaker just once in that same time frame: when he was up for election in 2012.\n\n\n\n\"Not only are we an afterthought, but we always have to beg [the White House],\" said one political operative.\n\n\"Not only are we an afterthought, but we always have to beg [the White House],\" said one political operative.\n\nWhether it was attending events or acknowledging the plight of Asian American undocumented immigrants, the operative said, getting the White House to help was like pulling teeth.\n\nAsian Americans make up approximately six percent of the population, but by 2050 some ten percent of individuals in the United States will be a member of the group. They represent the fastest growing swing vote in the country, with little loyalty to either Democrats or Republicans.\n\nIn a way, President Obama's apparent neglect of the Asian American community is even more striking considering his ties to the group. His half-sister has Indonesian ancestry, and he spent formative years in Hawaii, which has a majority-Asian population.\n\nFor Democrats who are otherwise proud advocates for Obama's White House, the president's recent neglect of Asian Americans is a difficult reality to face.\n\n\"I don't think he's done good or bad for the community. There's no significant achievement,\" asked one Asian American Democrat. \"Why are we always taken advantage of?\"\n\n\"But you're a supporter of his!\" I replied.\n\n\"Of course!\" the Democrat sighed.\n\nElaine Chao, the Secretary of Labor, held a regular reception for Asian American interns -- something that no longer takes place. It's the mere, minimum acknowledgement of the group -- and steps to boost its success -- that is missing now.\n\n\"We were actually treated like we were valued. [We didn't agree] on policy, of course, but as a community, as citizens who deserved recognition, it was very good,\" the Democrat said.\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) have consistently struggled with the problem of invisibility in Washington, D.C.\u2014and even advocates admit that often they have not been very aggressive about making demands.\n\n\"Maybe we need to be more vocal than we have,\" Mori said, attributing the problem in part to a cultural drawback. \"Asians are not the ones that go out and pound on the door.\"\n\n\"The AAPI community is too satisfied with crumbs,\" said an Asian American staffer in the Obama administration. \"Asian Americans are too happy about having the [White House] AAPI initiative, just that it exists. We've set the bar too low.\"\n\nOne positive spot for the Obama administration\u2019s work with the AAPI community has been its work with federal judges: since the beginning of his administration, the president has appointed 21 AAPI federal judges (by comparison he has appointed 58 African American judges and 33 Hispanic judges). And three of his cabinet secretaries in the past have been Asian Americans.\n\n\u201cWhile we appreciate the President's commitment to diversifying the federal bench and his cabinet with Asian American appointments, there is much more outreach to be done to help elevate and address the problems facing our communities,\u201d Moua said.\n\nThe AAPI community\u2019s problem is compounded by the fact that the White House\u2019s highest profile Asian Americans have left for other jobs. Christopher Lu, the former cabinet secretary, left for the Labor Department. And actor Kal Penn left as an Associate Director of the White House Office of Public Engagement in 2010.\n\n\u201cBefore when he had people around him that had community interests also, they worked on our behalf. Whereas there haven't been very many high-level Asians in the White House [lately],\u201d Mori said.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:59.598+0000"}
{"entityId": 2019, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "America\u2019s future president sounded almost like a politician at jury duty\u2014though he swore his profession was \u2018real estate.\u2019\n\nDonald Trump has pledged never to let another Oreo pass his lips.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not eating any more Oreos,\u201d he promised on Monday afternoon.\n\nHe made the declaration while speaking with reporters in the back of the jury assembly room at Manhattan Supreme Court. He was waiting to learn if he would be picked to serve on a panel, and he passed the time chatting about a wide range of subjects. That included the recent decision by Mondelez International, the parent of Nabisco, to move some of its Chicago operations to Mexico.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s such an American company,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the move would cost 2,000 American jobs. The actual number seems to be closer to 600, but what would count to his supporters would be the no-more-Oreos pledge. He was asked if he ate Oreos in the first place.\n\n\u201cMore than I should,\u201d he said.\n\nHis answer was a touch hollow, leaving you wondering if he in fact ate any Oreos. He sounded almost like a politician, which he is quick to tell you he is not. He had written down \u201creal estate\u201d as his occupation on the juror questionnaire.\n\n\u201cI figured I might as well put that,\u201d he said. \u201cI refused to say \u2018politician.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe noted that he had considerable difficulty ensuring that the \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d baseball hats he sports while campaigning and hawks on his website are U.S.-made.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t easy,\u201d he said.\n\nHe expounded on the hat\u2019s message.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have victories anymore,\u201d he said.\n\nHe made another pledge.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll have lots of victories with me,\u201d he said. \u201cLots of victories.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he took out some Tic Tacs.\n\n\u201cYou guys want any?\u201d he asked. \u201cMade in Mexico.\u201d\n\nHe realized the reporters might not understand that this was a bit of Trump humor. He examined the small plastic container.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s American-made,\u201d he confirmed.\n\nAt one point, the talk turned to the recent GOP debate and his response to Megyn Kelly\u2019s question about the ways he had described women in the past. He took renewed pleasure in his response that he had only talked that way about Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\n\n\u201cTotally threw Megyn Kelly off her game,\u201d he said. \u201dI never thought Rosie would be good for me.\u201d\n\nHe made no mention of his subsequent remark that Kelly had been so angry she had blood coming out her eyes and \u201cwherever.\u201d And though he joked that his jury room gab was \u201cthe world\u2019s longest press conference,\u201d his chat with the reporters was just that and in circumstances where a certain decorum was required. Nobody brought up what many had taken to be a menstrual reference.\n\nNot that all the bad press about the remark seemed to have hurt Trump very much. He marveled at the power of Twitter, saying that in earlier times he had been forced just to take it when the press took whacks at him. Now, with social media, he was able to reach millions with no middleman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like owning a newspaper without the losses,\u201d he said.\n\nThen, because he is Trump, he added, \u201cIt\u2019s like owning a huge newspaper.\u201d\n\nHe repeated a line about him being the Ernest Hemingway of 140 characters. He allowed that he does not always tweet his own tweets.\n\n\u201cSometimes I dictate them,\u201d he said.\n\nHe had gone right to Twitter when Rand Paul slammed him.\n\n\u201cI hit him back hard,\u201d Trump said.\n\nLindsey Graham had also gone after Trump and was now at zero in the polls.\n\n\u201cHow is it possible?\u201d Trump asked.\n\n\u201cI have to stay trim and slim,\u201d he later said. \u201cI don\u2019t need bulging pockets.\u201d\n\nHe said of Jeb Bush. \u201cJeb lacks energy. There is a lot of energy missing.\u201d\n\nA reporter asked Trump why he had scheduled a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Wednesday at the same hour as the one Bush was holding there. Trump said he figured it would be a good time for him to get out a crowd.\n\n\u201cBecause Bush draws so poorly,\u201d he said.\n\nThe one hitch could have come if his name was picked out of the wooden drum used to select jurors randomly should any be needed that particular day.\n\n\u201cIf I get picked, I\u2019m not really sure what I\u2019m going to do,\u201d he said. \u201cTell 7,000 people I was just kidding?\u201d\n\nHe figured that he had already won a far more important lottery.\n\n\u201cMy greatest lottery was the Vietnam lottery,\u201d he said.\n\nHe meant the draft lottery that had been held after the end of student exemptions during the Vietnam War. He seems still to take pleasure in having gotten a low enough number to save him from being called up. He is apparently counting on those who presently serve to help deliver those lots of victories.\n\nHe might have been spared even the jury lottery due to a crisis that arose shortly before he arrived on the courthouse on Monday morning. A court officer learned that the water was out in the whole building.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no water, then we got to shut the building down,\u201d a court official said.\n\nThe court officer checked on his radio to confirm there was no water on all floors.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s affirmative,\u201d a voice responded. \u201cIt\u2019s the whole building.\u201d\n\nA call went out for the engineer. A supervisor arrived.\n\n\u201cEverything OK?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d a court officer replied, predicting, \u201cA sh--t show. Literally.\u201d\n\nA court official imagined aloud what Trump would say if he arrived to find the building shut down.\n\n\u201c\u2018America\u2019s broken, even the courthouse doesn\u2019t have water!\u2019\u201d\n\nBut some unsung hero got the water going well enough so the toilets functioned and the courthouse remained open when a black stretch limousine pulled up. Trump stepped out in a blue suit and a blue-and-white striped tie and a white shirt. He had failed to respond to five previous summonses to jury duty, but he argued that they had been sent to an address other than his residence. He was now being given a chance to beat a $250 fine and avoid a political embarrassment by reporting.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my duty and I\u2019m happy to do it,\u201d he now said.\n\nHe ascended the courthouse steps between phalanxes of photographers held back by the twin railings running up the middle.\n\n\u201cThis is the line,\u201d a court officer by the main entrance told him. \u201cRight over here.\u201d\n\nTrump joined the prospective jurors waiting to pass through the two metal detectors. He was asked how he felt to be doing his civic duty.\n\n\u201cGot to do it,\u201d he said. \u201cGot to do it.\u201d\n\nHe was directed to an express lane for those who have no bag and nothing in their pockets. An unarmed retired city cop was there to act as a lone bodyguard as he took an elevator to the fourth floor and entered the Norman Goodman Jury Assembly Room. The other prospective jurors included Bobby Moynihan of Saturday Night Live fame.\n\nTrump took a seat at the front of the room to the left, beneath a monitor that was playing a video about jury service. He began filing out the questionnaire in which he gave his profession as real estate, not politician.\n\nIf our politics did bring the best of us to the fore, then we would have candidates who are like Irene Laracuenta, the longtime supervising jury clerk of New York County. She now took the microphone to instruct prospective jurors on what was expected of them and what they could expect.\n\nLaracuenta is a former court officer who has been in her present position for 19 years. She clearly still loves her job after performing this same ritual countless times. She spoke with great energy and seemed to be the very voice of true democracy.\n\n\u201cNobody gets special treatment,\u201d she said. \u201cI happen to think you all get treated specially by me and my staff.\u201d\n\nA brief break came once the paperwork was done. Trump did get a modicum of special treatment from the court officers who blocked off an alcove while he talked on a cellphone. His lone security man brought him a can of Coke, a straw, and a napkin, but the break ended before he could take a sip.\n\nAs Trump started back to the jury room, a lawyer asked to take a selfie with him.\n\n\u201cQuick,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe quick selfie done, the lawyer said, \u201cMy wife will be happy. Happy wife, happy life.\u201d\n\nUpon his return to the room, Trump stood in the back, causing a small commotion among some of the others. Laracuenta took the microphone and was again the voice of democracy in an age of celebrity.\n\n\u201cI think we are all famous in our own right,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump then took a seat toward the back between two young women. The one on his left was occupied with a laptop. The one on his right was listening to music on her phone. Trump sat holding his paperwork and just gazed straight ahead.\n\nTrump at rest was a showman without a show. He seemed at that moment a rich man bereft of inner workings, but he remained an object of such fascination that people whispered about his smallest movements.\n\n\u201cHis eyes are closed,\u201d a prospective juror whispered.\n\nHe had indeed closed them, but he then opened them and continued gazing ahead. Another prospective juror asked Trump how he was faring.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little different,\u201d Trump said.\n\nThe other prospective juror asked Trump what he would do to improve this jury selection process. Trump proved capable of praising one small bit of government in action.\n\n\u201cThey do a good job here,\u201d he said. \u201cVery good.\u201d\n\nJust before 12:30, Laracuenta, the official who runs this praiseworthy operation, told the prospective jurors that they would soon be breaking for lunch.\n\n\u201cAnd then you\u2019ll have two hours to do what you want to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re officially not supposed to tell you where to eat, but we can tell you where we eat.\u201d\n\nTrump was again media-mobbed as he went back down the steps to his limousine. He later said that he spent the break inspecting an office building at 40 Wall Street.\n\n\u201cWhich I own,\u201d he noted.\n\nHe said the building has a Duane Reade, which of course is \u201cthe biggest Duane Reade in America.\u201d He tweeted as he returned to the courthouse.\n\n\n\n\u201cListening to @rushlimbaugh on way back to Jury Duty. Fantastic show, terrific guy!\u201d\n\nA candidate who thinks Rush Limbaugh is a terrific guy with a fantastic show and who believes that we should just build a wall on the Mexican border and has said Iran supports ISIS was once more greeted like the man of the moment when he stepped from the limo. He again joined a line at the metal detectors. He proved to have nothing metal in his pockets but a single brass key to his apartment.\n\n\u201cI have to stay trim and slim,\u201d he later said. \u201cI don't need bulging pockets.\u201d\n\nHis bodyguard this time held some newspapers so the boss would not be stuck without anything to read as he sat in the jury room, as before.\n\n\u201cThat was a mistake,\u201d Trump allowed after he took a seat at the back.\n\nHe read two articles in The Wall Street Journal that were about him. One was at the bottom of the front page.\n\n\u201cHit the front page again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to be on the front page when you\u2019re right. When you\u2019re wrong, it\u2019s not good.\u201d\n\nHe seemed to have no doubt that he was right regarding just about everything as he began chatting with the reporters who sat around him. He was no longer Trump at rest. He was again a showman with a show.\n\nThe talk extended beyond the election to people he knows, such as football player Tom Brady, whom he called \u201ca great guy.\u201d He also spoke about people from his past such as the late Roy Cohn, a fixer lawyer whose myriad demonstrations of influence before his disbarment included helping get Trump\u2019s sister a federal judgeship. The sister, Maryann Trump Barry, was subsequently appointed by President Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n\nA reporter asked Trump about his late mother, the Scotch-born, Gaelic-speaking Mary Macleod Trump.\n\n\u201cA real beauty,\u201d he said. \u201cVery strong.\u201d\n\nHe was asked what she would have thought of her son becoming the Republican front-runner for president.\n\n\u201cShe wouldn't believe it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was asked if even he could believe it and he answered that he certainly could.\n\n\u201cPeople are so tired of incompetence,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are tired of politicians.\u201d\n\nNobody could deny the truth of that, which made the manifestly competent Laracuenta all the more remarkable as the day came to a close. She announced that no jurors had been needed but that the people in the room should not feel like they had been just wasting their time. She noted that cases are settled only because there are folks assembled and waiting to sit on a jury.\n\n\u201cThe threat of you folks being at the ready to judge them,\u201d she said.\n\nShe said they should hold off departing until their names were called and they were given a proof of service certificate excusing them for six years.\n\n\u201cFor my experience, when you leave here it\u2019s like your bodies are on fire,\u201d she said.\n\nShe closed by saying, \u201cThat\u2019s it. Thank you. I\u2019ll see you in six years.\u201d\n\nTrump offered high praise for all the court officers and clerks, most particularly for Laracuenta.\n\n\u201cVery professional, enthusiastic,\u201d he said, someone who well knows the importance and power of enthusiasm.\n\nAfter his name was called, Trump prepared to depart. He paused to pose for photos with some of the court officers, including one whose hair was dyed a blue that she pointed out matched his tie.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s do it,\u201d a court officer then said.\n\nThe court officer escorted Trump down the steps. Trump took the lead, pausing to speak to any number of media types. Several people heckled him about his immigration policies, but the overall tone was of people gone gaga over celebrity. A man held out a piece of cardboard on which he had taped two dollar bills, and Trump autographed one of them.\n\nAfter all, what he represents to his supporters is not just straight talk but M-O-N-E-Y. He rode off in his limousine, having completed his jury service and now able to return to a campaign that would have amazed even his mother. He tweeted again within the hour.\n\n\u201cMy official #MakeAmericaGreatAgain hat is now available online. To shop please visit http://www.DonaldJTrump.com\u2014it is selling fast!\u201d\n\nBack at the courthouse, the clerks and officers were ending a day that could have begun in disaster with an absence of running water\u2014but ended in a kind of triumph because of an abundance of competence and decency.\n\nA victory, though not one given by Trump.\n\nLaracuenta for President!", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:39:59.958+0000"}
