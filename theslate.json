In retrospect, it was a great move by the White House. The congressional review process, which effectively came to an end Thursday when Senate Democrats blocked a resolution disapproving of the Iran deal, gave the appearance of congressional debate on the agreement, but the deck was always stacked heavily in the White House\u2019s favor. In fact, the way the deal was orchestrated sets a precedent for expanded executive power that should concern even those who support this president and this deal.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nThe U.S. has two major ways of entering into international agreements: treaties and executive agreements. Treaties are legally stronger but harder to pass, because they require a two-thirds majority in the Senate in order to ratify. For that reason, executive agreements, which don\u2019t require congressional approval, have become far more common, though generally for less consequential agreements than the Iran deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe White House never sought to make the Iran deal a treaty. Was this a legitimate move? Republican senators certainly don\u2019t think so, and the lesser status of an executive agreement was the major point of Sen. Tom Cotton\u2019s infamous open letter to the government of Iran back in March. But the law is frustratingly ambiguous on which agreements are important enough to rise to treaty level. According to the Congressional Research Service: \u201cAs a matter of historical practice, some types of international agreements have traditionally been entered as treaties in all or nearly every instance, including compacts concerning mutual defense, extradition and mutual legal assistance, human rights, arms control and reduction, environmental protection, taxation, and the final resolution of boundary disputes\u201d [emphasis mine]. Then-Sen. Joe Biden objected in 2002 when President George W. Bush tried to make a handshake deal on nuclear arms reduction with Vladimir Putin rather than submitting it to the Senate as a treaty. As President Obama has frequently pointed out, the Iran deal differs from past deals with Russia because it does not require the U.S. to cut its own arsenal. But still, given its economic and national security implications, the deal is at least the kind of agreement that has been negotiated as a treaty in the past.\n\nThe White House strategy is a product of the times. The last major treaty approved by the Senate was the New Start arms control agreement with Russia, narrowly passed in 2010. That feels like a long time ago. In today\u2019s political context, it\u2019s hard to imagine two-thirds of Congress voting to ratify a treaty on anything more controversial than fisheries management. (The White House is planning a similar end run around Congress for the upcoming U.N. climate agreement.)\n\nWithin the category of executive agreements, there are gradations. There are \u201ccongressional-executive agreements,\u201d in which Congress authorizes the president to negotiate an agreement\u2014trade deals like NAFTA, for example\u2014and \u201csole executive agreements\u201d backed only by the president\u2019s executive authority. Which is the Iran deal? It\u2019s not exactly clear. Some legal scholars argue that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which set up the review process, was a NAFTA-like authorization to negotiate. Others say it was nothing of the sort, and that the Obama administration has consistently said the deal is \u201cnonbinding.\u201d The distinction matters as it could determine whether the next president actually has the authority to tear up the deal \u201con day one,\u201d as several Republican candidates have promised.\n\nEither way, the review process that Congress agreed to muddied the waters significantly, giving the White House the appearance of winning a vote in Congress that never had to be held in the first place, which is why conservative critics like the National Review\u2019s Andrew McCarthy have been railing against it so vociferously. By the time conservatives in Congress realized their mistake and tried to call off the debate, it was far too late in the game.\n\nSo now, instead of two-thirds of the Senate having to agree to a deal on the table, two-thirds of both the Senate and the House had to disagree in order for it not to go into effect. Nothing done was illegal. As the conservative legal scholar Jack Goldsmith wrote, the administration \u201ccleverly stitched together the president's authority to lift domestic sanctions, his authority to make political agreements, and his authority to vote for the United States in the Security Council, in order to make sure the Iran Deal would stick unless super-majorities of Congress reject it.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:21:55.441+0000"}

For starters, it will provide a helpful\u2014if incomplete\u2014snapshot of the topics that candidates are talking about online, and which of those are resonating with voters on social media. And, as the campaign continues to unfold online and off, it will also hopefully allow us to draw some conclusions about which candidates are winning the campaign Twitter wars and why.\n\nThe ground rules again:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWe\u2019re defining a candidate\u2019s most successful tweet as the one that receives the most retweets\u2014though in the event two or more tweets are neck-and-neck, the one with significantly more favorites will get the edge.

For that reason, executive agreements, which don\u2019t require congressional approval, have become far more common, though generally for less consequential agreements than the Iran deal.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe White House never sought to make the Iran deal a treaty. Was this a legitimate move? Republican senators certainly don\u2019t think so, and the lesser status of an executive agreement was the major point of Sen. Tom Cotton\u2019s infamous open letter to the government of Iran back in March. But the law is frustratingly ambiguous on which agreements are important enough to rise to treaty level. According to the Congressional Research Service: \u201cAs a matter of historical practice, some types of international agreements have traditionally been entered as treaties in all or nearly every instance, including compacts concerning mutual defense, extradition and mutual legal assistance, human rights, arms control and reduction, environmental protection, taxation, and the final resolution of boundary disputes\u201d [emphasis mine]. Then-Sen. Joe Biden objected in 2002 when President George W. Bush tried to make a handshake deal on nuclear arms reduction with Vladimir Putin rather than submitting it to the Senate as a treaty. As President Obama has frequently pointed out, the Iran deal differs from past deals with Russia because it does not require the U.S. to cut its own arsenal. But still, given its economic and national security implications, the deal is at least the kind of agreement that has been negotiated as a treaty in the past.\n\nThe White House strategy is a product of the times. The last major treaty approved by the Senate was the New Start arms control agreement with Russia, narrowly passed in 2010. That feels like a long time ago. In today\u2019s political context, it\u2019s hard to imagine two-thirds of Congress voting to ratify a treaty on anything more controversial than fisheries management. (The White House is planning a similar end run around Congress for the upcoming U.N. climate agreement.)\n\nWithin the category of executive agreements, there are gradations. There are \u201ccongressional-executive agreements,\u201d in which Congress authorizes the president to negotiate an agreement\u2014trade deals like NAFTA, for example\u2014and \u201csole executive agreements\u201d backed only by the president\u2019s executive authority. Which is the Iran deal? It\u2019s not exactly clear. Some legal scholars argue that the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, which set up the review process, was a NAFTA-like authorization to negotiate. Others say it was nothing of the sort, and that the Obama administration has consistently said the deal is \u201cnonbinding.\u201d The distinction matters as it could determine whether the next president actually has the authority to tear up the deal \u201con day one,\u201d as several Republican candidates have promised.\n\nEither way, the review process that Congress agreed to muddied the waters significantly, giving the White House the appearance of winning a vote in Congress that never had to be held in the first place, which is why conservative critics like the National Review\u2019s Andrew McCarthy have been railing against it so vociferously. By the time conservatives in Congress realized their mistake and tried to call off the debate, it was far too late in the game.\n\nSo now, instead of two-thirds of the Senate having to agree to a deal on the table, two-thirds of both the Senate and the House had to disagree in order for it not to go into effect. Nothing done was illegal. As the conservative legal scholar Jack Goldsmith wrote, the administration \u201ccleverly stitched together the president's authority to lift domestic sanctions, his authority to make political agreements, and his authority to vote for the United States in the Security Council, in order to make sure the Iran Deal would stick unless super-majorities of Congress reject it.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:22:17.905+0000"}

{"entityId": 10, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Courtesy of Jeffrey R. Staab/CBS\n\nAs the father of a son, I found it hard to watch Vice President Joe Biden talk about his son with Stephen Colbert. Biden talked about whether he\u2019s emotionally ready to commit to a campaign after losing his son Beau in May. He told the story of the unexpected grief that ambushed him recently while in Denver: \u201cI landed at a military base and I met a whole group of military families. ... And I was talking about them being the backbone and sinew of this country. And all of a sudden\u2014it\u2019s going great\u2014and a guy in the back yells, \u2018Maj. Beau Biden, bronze star, sir, served with him in Iraq.\u2019 And all of a sudden I lost it.\u201d I understand why.\n\nThis summer we\u2019ve been talking about authenticity in American politics. According to polls, Donald Trump has it. Sen. Bernie Sanders has it. Hillary Clinton\u2019s advisers tell the New York Times she is going to try to show it. Political authenticity isn\u2019t real authenticity; it\u2019s the synthetic public version that approximates the real thing. We know this because when candidates like Mitt Romney and Al Gore are authentically bad at engaging in the showmanship of politics, they are penalized for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPoliticians sometimes show us actual authenticity\u2014anger, fear, uncertainty, weakness\u2014and it is usually a political liability. But this other authenticity offers the power of personal example\u2014people can actually use what they see in another person to sustain them in their own lives.\n\nBiden is operating in both fields right now, offering an ongoing emotional reaction to the loss of his son while publicly thinking about whether he\u2019ll launch a presidential race. Whether the example of grace and endurance and faith that Biden shows contributes to his viability as a candidate is up to voters to decide. But as an example of how to live a life\u2014both before and after the moments of acute grief\u2014it\u2019s powerful.\n\nBiden is putting his heart in our laps.\n\nAs George W. Bush\u2019s former speechwriter Michael Gerson wrote, Biden may be the last human being in politics. His avocation as a politician has often been to tell military families who have lost loved ones in battle that it\u2019s possible to emerge from the other side of grief. Biden was a witness to this after he lost his wife and daughter in a car accident. Now Biden is back with those grieving families again. This time he isn\u2019t a prophet from the other side, but walking with them in fresh mourning.\n\nAfter the rallying point of a funeral, there\u2019s a period when the neighbors stop bringing the dishes of lasagna and you\u2019re left alone with the loss. You pick up the phone to make a call to a person who isn\u2019t there anymore. It\u2019s bleak. You don\u2019t even have the busywork of the to-do list of mourning to distract you. That\u2019s the stage we\u2019re all watching with Biden and his family, and he\u2019s inviting us in to watch because that\u2019s the messy way of Joe Biden. Politicians sometimes say, \u201cLet me show you what\u2019s in my heart.\u201d The fact that they must preface the remark means they\u2019re not really going to. Biden is putting his heart in our laps.\n\nBiden could turn it all off and say he\u2019s not running, but when your life and your son\u2019s life have been so dedicated to public service and that service has sustained you through brutal loss, what holds you back is also what compels you. When I talk to people who know the vice president well, they describe how Beau\u2019s request that his father run for president also eggs him on. \u201cYou know your success when you turn and look at your child and realize they turned out better than you,\u201d Joe Biden said, quoting his father. \u201cI was a hell of a success: My son was better than me in almost every way.\u201d The feedback loop of parenting is powerful. You want to be worthy of a person you think is so great. After he\u2019s gone I can imagine you wouldn\u2019t want to let him down.\n\nOur children remind us parents of our best selves. We sustain them and lift them up and they do the same for us. Biden has an acute form of this. As he discussed with Colbert, Beau helped raise Biden after he lost his wife and daughter, and he was doing that until the end. \u201c \u2018Dad, I know how much you love me,\u2019 \u201d Biden recounted Beau telling him near the end of his life. \u201c \u2018You\u2019ve got to promise me something. Promise me you\u2019re going to be alright.\u2019 He said, \u2018No matter what happens dad, I\u2019m going to be all right. Promise me.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAt times the interview felt like it was just Colbert and Biden, and this was one of those moments. Colbert talked about playing that role for his mother after his father and two of his brothers died in a plane crash. And yet, of course, Beau was also sustained by his father. Beau Biden\u2019s friends talk about him and his brother Hunter as products of what happens when you put a child in proximity of the values that people admire in Joe Biden.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:22:31.807+0000"}

The customer in front of you buys a can of beans with a SNAP card. You buy a bottle of wine and pay with cash. Then the next person in line angrily accuses you of wasting taxpayer money by buying alcohol with food stamps.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nYou'd probably be confused. The argument against you is that because the grocery store accepts food stamps from some customers, and because money is fungible, then you, by osmosis, have paid for your wine with food stamps.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSounds stupid, but that's the exact argument that Republicans are using against Planned Parenthood. Some congressional Republicans are threatening a government shutdown in order to cut off federal funding to the women's health care provider. They want you to believe that this is about abortion, but the problem is that the money in question goes to the wide array of preventive services that Planned Parenthood offers\u2014from contraception to cancer screenings\u2014that are not abortion. Since contraception funding remains popular in the U.S., Republicans have been pushing the \"money is fungible\" line, most recently used by Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner in an anti\u2013Planned Parenthood congressional hearing. It implies that while Planned Parenthood is supposed to be getting money for contraception, it's actually going to subsidize abortion.\n\nThe problem is that it doesn't work that way. To understand why, it's useful to take a look at how Planned Parenthood operates and where its money comes from.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that Planned Parenthood clinics operate like any other medical clinic. A patient comes in, gets some services, and is billed according to what services she got. Some patients are eligible for federal money to offset the costs of some services. This works in a couple of different ways.\n\nFor patients who are on Medicaid, the process is the same as with any insurance program. The patient's bill is sent to her insurer, in this case Medicaid. They pay for any services that are covered and she is on the hook for the rest. Since Medicaid does not cover abortion, any Medicaid patients who get an abortion have to pay the price in full, in cash.\n\nMany conservatives have argued that Medicaid patients should simply go elsewhere for care. The problem is that many private doctors will refuse to take them on, because Medicaid reimbursements are so low. Planned Parenthood, being a non-profit, is more open to helping Medicaid patients.\n\nTitle X funding is a little trickier, because it is given as grants and not reimbursements, but works in roughly the same way. If a patient falls within the Title X income parameters, the clinic is able to pay for part of that bill with Title X funding. In this way, low-income patients can get, for instance, a pack of birth control pills that would normally cost $50 for $10. They can't obtain abortions in the same way, as Title X funding cannot go to abortion.\n\nRepublicans who tout the \"money is fungible\" line want you to imagine that Planned Parenthood draws on one big pot of government money for all its services. But since medical services are billed and funded individually, that's not actually how this works. For instance, if subsidies that discount contraception disappear, the price of contraception goes up, but the price of abortion will stay the same.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:22:41.308+0000"}

Colbert asked about Biden's son, Beau, who died in May of brain cancer, and Biden opened up about his grief and the role of religion in his life, and the difficulty of deciding whether to run for the Oval Office in 2016, which Beau, in the last days of his life, had urged his father to do.\n\nAn earlier family tragedy played a formative role in Joe Biden's political career before he was sworn into office in the U.S. Senate. He'd won his seat in the 1972 election and was set to join the body the following January when his wife and children, out for Christmas shopping, were struck by a tractor-trailer in their car.

CNN reports that \"Senate Republicans are considering a revote on the measure next week to put additional pressure on Democrats\" and the House of Representatives is just getting started on a series of votes objecting to the deal:\n\nAfter the Senate vote Thursday, the House passed a resolution on a straight party vote stating that the President failed to comply with the law on the Iran nuclear deal because he didn't provide Congress with details on so-called \"side deals\" governing inspections of possible nuclear sites.\n\nThe non-binding measure was approved 246-186 and could lay the groundwork for a future legal challenge against the Obama Administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFollowing the 58-42 vote, President Obama released a statement describing the deal with Iran as part of \"a foreign policy that leaves our country\u2014and the world\u2014a safer place\" and praising the Senate for \"taking an historic step forward.\"\n\nFor nearly two years, we negotiated from a position of strength to reach an agreement that meets our core objectives.

It was not a great look.\n\nThe graphic was a little better in the context of the article it was meant to accompany, which notes that the debate over the deal has \u201cdivided Democrats between their loyalties to the president and their constituents, especially Jewish ones,\u201d but it still didn't do a good job of explaining to readers why Jewish as a category in this chart was relevant information.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo I\u2019ll explain: It\u2019s not exactly a secret that the prime minister of Israel has been the most prominent critic of the Iran deal, arguing that it poses an existential threat to the Jewish state; that pro-Israel lobbying groups have spent record sums trying to defeat it; and that a significant portion, though not the majority, of American Jews strongly oppose the deal.

The Israeli media has focused in particular on how many Jewish members of Congress have supported the deal.

Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nLate last month, at the summer meeting of the Democratic National Committee, Martin O\u2019Malley demanded more debates. \u201cFour debates and only four debates\u2014we are told, not asked\u2014before voters in our earliest states make their decisions,\u201d said the presidential candidate and former Maryland governor. \u201cThis sort of rigged process has never been attempted before,\u201d he added. \u201cOne debate in Iowa. That\u2019s it. One debate in New Hampshire. That\u2019s all we can afford.\u201d\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise O\u2019Malley wants more debates; despite solid credentials and a competitive record, he\u2019s virtually invisible in the Democratic primary, far behind Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and even one possible candidate who hasn\u2019t declared yet in Vice President Biden. (He\u2019s ahead of Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat Lincoln Chafee, though.) More debates would give him a platform and a chance to appeal beyond the narrow slice of Democratic voters who reject Hillary but don\u2019t want Sanders.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nClinton says she\u2019s open to more debates\u2014\u201cI debated a lot in 2008, and I would certainly be there with lots of enthusiasm and energy if they decide to add more debates\u201d\u2014and Sanders, like O\u2019Malley, is thrilled at the possibility of a larger set of debate stages. \u201cI think this country benefits, all people benefit, democracy benefits, when we have debates, and I want to see more of them,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI think that debates are a good thing.\u201d\n\nBut additional debates can do more than help candidates and broaden the audience for the party\u2019s message; they can finally give the media something to talk about other than Hillary\u2019s ongoing woes. Far from a distraction or risk, more debates might be the only thing Democrats can do to shift attention from Clinton and her assorted problems, from email to falling poll numbers.\n\nIt\u2019s worth asking why we don\u2019t have more debates, if every candidate wants them. The answer is straightforward: DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is fully opposed to more debates, perhaps in an effort\u2014as O\u2019Malley suggests\u2014to shield Clinton from further criticism. \u201cWe\u2019re not changing the process. We\u2019re having six debates,\u201d she said on Thursday, before issuing a threat to anyone who tries to circumvent the party. \u201cThe candidates will be uninvited from subsequent debates if they accept an invitation to anything outside of the six sanctioned debates.\u201d Not all DNC leaders agree. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, vice chairs Tulsi Gabbard and R.T. Rybak argued the case for more debates. \u201cWe believe that the DNC\u2019s decision to limit Presidential candidates to six debates, with a threat of exclusion for any candidate who participates in any non-DNC sanctioned debate, is a mistake,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt limits the ability of the American people to benefit from a strong, transparent, vigorous debate between our Presidential candidates, as they make the important decision of who will be our Democratic Presidential nominee.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no sign Wasserman Schultz will budge. But if Wasserman Schultz is seriously interested in improving the party and boosting its candidates, including Hillary Clinton, she might want to reconsider.\n\nRight now Clinton coverage is consumed by the email scandal. Everything from her policy proposals to her overall lead in the Democratic primary is overshadowed by the drip of news around her email use as secretary of state. Even though there\u2019s no evidence of criminal behavior\u2014specifically, no indication Clinton passed classified documents or deliberately sent classified information through her private email system\u2014the story won\u2019t go away because it feeds into her pre-existing image as being scandal-prone. Also, never mind that Hillary\u2019s offense has more to do with the action than the venue; sending classified materials via official state.gov email is just as illegal as sending it through an unofficial channel, and just as vulnerable to outside interference. (See the massive Russian hack of the State Department\u2019s email system). There are legitimate criticisms of Clinton\u2019s decision and important questions about her commitment to official transparency. Those aside, however, it\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s an actual \u201cscandal\u201d in this email controversy.

Whoever manages to capture the outsider vote\u2014Pat Robertson, Steve Forbes, Pat Buchanan\u2014may go on to win a state or two, but otherwise serves as a kitschy roadside tourist trap en route to the establishment candidate\u2019s coronation. Maybe it will still play out that way, but the summer of Trump has lasted long enough for the political press to stop presuming that the old rules will eventually assert themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nConsider what Trump and Carson have amassed under their respective outsider banners by mid-September. Thursday\u2019s CNN/ORC national poll finds Trump and Carson at 32 and 19 percent, respectively, giving the two novice politicians a majority between them. Trump and Carson also top the field in terms of voters\u2019 second choices. Maybe all that support will transfer elsewhere as voting time nears, per the laws of presidential primary physics. Or maybe we now officially live in a country that\u2019s rejected physics, once and for all, as a sacrilegious tool of the elites.\n\nTrump and Carson charted their paths to the top in starkly different ways. Trump goes on television several times per day and says that he is the greatest, most successful human being in history, better than Jesus Christ\u2014a third-rate builder who\u2019d be clueless trying to play the Manhattan permit game. He feasts off celebrity, trash talk, and the round-the-clock media attention that comes with both. He lures one rival after another into a competition of alpha male bona fides, a competition he will always win. It is all swagger, a trait that lends itself well to his platform of jingoistic nativism.\n\nCarson, on the other end of the spectrum, does not insult other candidates. He does not raise his voice. He does not appear on television too often, and when he does, he looks ready for a nap. But as someone who\u2019s had a side career in inspirational speaking for decades, he knows how to connect with Republican audiences with a combination of humor and biblical messaging you might find in a church sermon. The thread that connects these two unlikely outsiders sitting atop the Republican field is a feeling of total self-confidence, expressed through polar opposite styles.\n\nNaturally, Trump\u2019s been looking to pound this guy\u2014to emasculate him the same way he\u2019s done to Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham, Rick Perry, Rand Paul, and whoever else has leapt onto his radar. (We\u2019ll see if he even bothers with the ever-so-desperate Bobby Jindal.) Trump has claimed, humorously, that he never punches\u2014he simply counter-punches. In an interview last Friday, he couldn\u2019t contain his desire to counter-punch Carson. After conceding that Carson is a \u201cnice guy,\u201d Trump added, \u201cI'm hoping for Ben to really hit me at some point because I love to counter-punch.\u201d\n\nAt an event in Anaheim, California, on Wednesday night, Carson gave Trump all he needed. As the Washington Post reported, Carson was asked to name a difference between him and Trump. \u201cThe biggest thing is that I realize where my success has come from,\u201d he said, \u201cand I don\u2019t any way deny my faith in God.\u201d\n\nFinally, an opportunity for Trump to let loose all of the ace Ben Carson material he\u2019s been workshopping. In a CNN appearance Thursday morning, Trump described Carson, a world-renowned neurosurgeon, as \u201cperhaps an OK doctor\u201d who, \u201cif you look at his past, which I've done \u2026 was not a big man of faith.\u201d By contrast, Trump described himself as \u201ca believer, big league, in God.\u201d He continued: \u201cAll of a sudden [Carson]'s becoming this man of faith and he was heavy into the world of abortion,\u201d an accusation that\u2019s not entirely fabricated. Lastly, Trump said that Carson makes the infamously \u201clow-energy\u201d Bush \u201clook like the Energizer Bunny.\u201d\n\nThis is usually the part where the subject of Trump\u2019s taunts responds with a tepid So\u2019s yer old man jab before wishing he had never gotten involved at all. (Ask Graham, if you can track down his new cellphone number.) When reached by a Washington Post reporter Thursday morning, though, Carson did something truly spectacular: He apologized to Trump for any misunderstanding. \u201cI would like to say to him that the intention was not to talk to him but about what motivates me,\u201d he told the Post. \u201cIf he took that as a personal attack on him, I apologize, it was certainly not the intent.\u201d\n\nCarson added that he does not want to get into a \u201cgladiator fight with Trump.\u201d That\u2019s smart. He, like everyone else who\u2019s tried, would lose such a bout.\n\nWhat Carson has that the other candidates don\u2019t is an alternative to engaging Trump on Trump\u2019s terms. A candidate like Graham, or Perry, or Jindal\u2014or even Bush at this point\u2014needs to try anything to get a boost. The most obvious way to do that is to poke a stick at the figure through whom all media coverage runs, even if it\u2019s going to get him poked back. Carson needs no such jolt. He\u2019s been doing perfectly well for himself running a campaign that\u2019s an extension of his own popular persona: laconic, polite, and media-cautious. Jabbing the monster, then backing off a step and saying, \u201cWho, me?\u201d works for him in a way that would signal defeat for anyone else.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:22:52.515+0000"}

Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.\n\nAnswer by Barack Obama, 44th president of the United States:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe congressional vote on the Iran nuclear agreement is the most consequential foreign policy debate our country has had since the invasion of Iraq in 2003. So thank you for asking this question\u2014it's an important one.\n\nAs commander-in-chief, I have no greater responsibility than keeping our country safe and supporting the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country. When I took office, there were nearly 180,000 troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. We've worked hard to bring almost all of them home. So it is with them in mind that I weigh questions of war and peace. Congress should too\u2014because that is a question members are facing this week when they decide whether they will reject the Iran nuclear agreement. Here's why:\n\nThe U.S. and international community have long recognized a nuclear-armed Iran as one of the greatest threats to global security. There is no disagreement about that. A nuclear-armed Iran would threaten our friends in the Middle East, and provide a nuclear shield to the Iranian regime's support for terrorism, human rights abuses, and other destabilizing activities in the region. It would pose an unacceptable risk to Israel, which Iranian leaders have threatened to destroy. Should Iran obtain a nuclear weapon, it could compel other countries in the region to pursue their own nuclear programs, sparking a nuclear arms race in the most volatile region in the world. And, right now, we are dangerously close to that reality, as Iran currently has enough fissile material to build 10 to 12 bombs.\n\nSo the question is not whether we should prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, but how. When I took office, I made it my policy to keep all options\u2014including possible military options\u2014on the table to address that danger. But I have consistently said that if an opportunity to find a diplomatic resolution could be found, the U.S. should pursue it\u2014not just because of the costs of war, but also because a negotiated agreement would offer a more effective, verifiable, and durable resolution.\n\nThat is why my administration worked hard to bring our international partners together to enact the multilateral sanctions regime that helped bring Iran to the negotiating table. Before that, the sanctions that the U.S. already had in place for decades had failed to achieve that result. And, it wasn't easy\u2014many of our international partners lost billions of dollars because of their decision to cooperate with the U.S. But we successfully built an international coalition. Iran's economy contracted severely, and, after nearly two years of negotiations, Iran agreed to a diplomatic resolution that blocks every pathway it could possibly use to obtain a nuclear weapon. You can learn more about how it works here.\n\nOur allies stand with the U.S. and this agreement. But, they have been clear: If we walk away from this deal, we walk away alone. Time and again, our allies have stated that the idea of a \u201cbetter deal\u201d is a false one, and that they will not join with the U.S. to increase multilateral sanctions because they believe we have the good deal we sought today. Without international support or the unprecedented inspections regime, Iran will be able to continue accelerating its nuclear program unimpeded.\n\nIn that scenario\u2014where diplomacy fails because we chose to walk away\u2014any president who is dedicated to America's national security and that of our allies like Israel will ultimately be left with only one option\u2014military action\u2014to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. And every estimate suggests military action would only set back Iran's program by a few years at best\u2014a fraction of the time we gain with this deal.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:22:56.818+0000"}

The U.S. has warned Russia against increasing its aid to Assad. But the Kremlin has said that it\u2019s no secret it supplies aid to Syria, a close Russian ally since the Soviet-era, and doesn\u2019t understand the \u201cstrange hysteria.\u201d Bulgaria announced this week that it would not allow Russian military planes to fly over its territory due to concerns over the buildup, but Iran\u2014another Syrian ally\u2014stepped in to open up its own territory.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe stakes of all this are higher than normal as Russia reportedly hoped for a meeting between Putin and President Obama at the U.N. General Assembly in New York later this month to discuss the crisis in Syria. Putin may hope to join the coalition fighting against ISIS as a means of normalizing relations between Russia and Western countries that have been strained over the situation in Ukraine. However, Russia\u2019s vision for an international anti-ISIS coalition includes Assad\u2019s military. This is probably a nonstarter for the U.S. due to reports that Assad has been helping ISIS as well as continuing to use chemical weapons against civilians. British Prime Minister David Cameron said this week that both ISIS and Assad \u201chave to go,\u201d by military force if necessary.\n\nThe thing is, while the U.S. would also like to see Assad go, it hasn\u2019t yet shown any willingness to use military force against him, instead launching airstrikes only against ISIS and the al-Qaida\u2013linked Jabhat al-Nusra, while training \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel groups fighting against both ISIS and Assad. Being a little bit at war may sound like being a little bit pregnant, but that about sums up the situation between the U.S. and Assad\u2019s government right now.\n\nWhile none of the alternatives look particularly appealing, the current U.S. strategy against both Syria and ISIS seems hopeless. Efforts to train an anti-ISIS, pro-Western rebel force have been slow-going, so the U.S. is shifting its emphasis to aiding local Kurdish guerillas, who have been much more effective on the battlefield. The problem with that strategy is that neighboring Turkey, which has pledged to help in the fight against ISIS, has also launched a violent crackdown against its own Kurdish separatists. There\u2019s no lack of allies against both ISIS and Assad. The problem is: They all hate each other.\n\nAssad\u2019s troops are losing ground, but mostly to the jihadis. Government forces effectively withdrew from the northwestern Idlib province after al-Nusra captured an airbase there this week. Another airbase in eastern Syria has come under heavy attack from ISIS. So even if Putin managed to convince Western countries to hold their noses and support Assad as the lesser evil against ISIS\u2014and it\u2019s not at all clear that\u2019s what he is\u2014he may not even have the military capability to be much of an ally anymore.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:22:57.479+0000"}

Amid the usual array of familiar devices, slightly modified, the company demoed one truly intriguing product. With a third-party app from AirStrip, Apple Watch wearers will be able to send heart-rate data directly to their doctors. AirStrip\u2019s technology is supposedly sophisticated enough to differentiate between a pregnant woman\u2019s heart rate and that of a developing fetus.\n\nMuch as the fetal heart-rate feature seemed to excite the audience, the potential for direct communication between patients and their doctors was the most promising detail in this announcement. As they currently stand, medical privacy laws in the United States have severely restricted the clinical potential of mobile technologies. Any successful attempt to work around these limitations could lead to tremendous and important changes in personal health care.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEnacted in 1996, HIPAA\u2014which stands for Healthcare Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2014serves two primary functions. First, it helps patients move from one insurance company to another, facilitating the previously onerous process of transferring medical information between health care providers. Second, it protects the privacy of that information by imposing steep penalties on those who fail to treat test results, appointment schedules, and more with proper caution.\n\nSuch regulations are obviously important, but they can also place serious roadblocks on the medical industry\u2019s ability to adapt to new technologies. Because medical privacy laws are so stringent\u2014and because many of them predate the rise of the Internet\u2014ensuring that smartphones and other devices are HIPAA compliant can be difficult and costly. According to one expert, building the proper infrastructure can \u201ccost $200,000 to $300,000, take months, or even years, to complete, and carry significant execution risk.\u201d Attempting to use mobile devices in medical environments also means adhering to stringent security protocols, and even then compliance can be fuzzy.\n\nFor some developers, these issues came to a head last summer when Apple released its HealthKit, which allows apps to share a user\u2019s personal health information with one another. By providing a central hub for storing and sharing a user\u2019s data, the company may have made things more difficult for app developers, who had to begin thinking more carefully about HIPAA guidelines.\n\nWhen Apple released its watch, it attempted to directly address some of these concerns.

{"entityId": 23, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Other than the EV Project, there was nothing going on. Republicans had decided they didn\u2019t like EVs anymore, and the administration inexplicably determined that, henceforth, the private sector should take care of installing and running public EV charging stations.\n\nThe EV Project spent $230 million giving away chargers\u2014mostly to Nissan Leaf and Chevy Volt owners, not public spaces. The vast majority of these were Level 2 chargers. For that amount of money, you could carpet major U.S. cities with Level 1 charging and still have money left over for fast chargers. But the entire EV Project included only 107 fast chargers . Averaged out, the cost per charging unit installed was about $19,000\u2014 much , much higher than it should have been. Not all of that $230 million went to chargers\u2014it was also spent on extensive analysis of the data\u2014but the costs still seemed stratospheric.\n\nEV plugs come at three power levels. Level 1 is just a standard 120-volt electrical outlet. It\u2019s dirt-cheap, and can give you 4 or 5 miles of range in an hour . Level 2 charging requires electrical equipment that is much more expensive and runs off the same outlet as a clothes dryer at 240 volts. It provides 10 or 20 miles of range an hour, depending on the car. Then there\u2019s DC fast charging at 480 volts. It\u2019s expensive but can fill an EV battery to 80 percent in 20 to 30 minutes\u2014a huge advantage.\n\nBut when I went to work as an adviser to the undersecretary of energy in 2012, it was immediately evident that a program to promote essential charging infrastructure was missing. There was a public-private partnership called the EV Project. But personally, I was mystified by its approach.\n\nAfter more than 100 years of investing in internal combustion engines\u2014and trillions of dollars invested in the infrastructure for oil and gasoline\u2014it made sense for government to invest in this transition to EVs.\n\nIn 2009, during the stimulus, the administration went a bit crazy funding big, expensive EV startups and battery plants. Washington spent $2.5 billion on loans to Nissan, Fisker, and Tesla. It also sank almost $600 million funding battery-manufacturing plants for A123 ( which has since gone bankrupt ), Dow-Kokam (sold off by Dow in 2013), and LG Chem. Then there was the up-to-$7,500 consumer tax break for buying an electric car. Good for up to 200,000 units per manufacturer, that generous rebate will end up costing the U.S. government roughly $2 billion per automaker. Considering there are about 30 auto manufacturers doing business in the United States, that could get expensive. All this was supposed to lay the foundation for a new generation of clean, quiet electric vehicles on American roads.\n\nThe following year, John McCain toured the Chevy Volt design center and candidate Barack Obama called for 1 million plug-in electric vehicles on U.S. roads by 2015 . As GM\u2019s management stared into the abyss of bankruptcy, Congress and the Obama administration made the safe delivery of the Volt a virtual precondition for the company\u2019s $50 billion bailout .\n\nStarting in 2007, after California had already spent more than a decade promoting electric vehicles, Washington embraced EVs as the solution to skyrocketing oil prices, moribund American manufacturing, climate change, and dependence on foreign oil. It didn\u2019t matter if you were a tree hugger, union leader, or national security buff: There was something to love about EVs.\n\nAmerica\u2019s policy was not the result of thoughtful cost-cutting\u2014we still spend abundantly on EVs. We just spend that money in the wrong places.\n\nDuring the economic crisis, the Obama administration invested prodigiously in electric cars\u2014but afterward it curtailed any support for public charging infrastructure. And that\u2019s holding EVs back. So while California started the electric revolution , Washington is on the brink of ending it. Today American companies manufacture fewer EVs than automakers from Europe, China, or Japan , and U.S. EV sales have slipped from first to third in the world\u2014behind Europe and China . Meanwhile, last month Russia\u2019s prime minister decreed that every gas station in the country must install EV charging by November 2016 .\n\nAs I steered a BMW i3 loaner into a Northwest Washington, D.C., parking garage, I glanced at the time: 30 minutes before drinks. The electric car\u2019s battery was almost dead, but I could fix that\u2014this garage had a high-power charging station. It could add about 60 miles of juice in that half-hour. I pushed a button to unlatch the car\u2019s charging port, jumped out, and gathered the hefty electrical cable. Then I reached for my credit card and looked for a swiper affixed to the charging box. Instead, I found a small decal explaining that I needed a membership to charge at an eVgo station. Translation: No matter how much I was willing to pay to charge at that moment\u2014and I was willing to pay quite a bit\u2014I couldn\u2019t. And I found myself thinking that this eVgo charger was an apt metaphor for the Obama administration\u2019s policy on electric vehicles.\n\nPublic charging was not going to be profitable as a stand-alone product. Electricity as a fuel is cheap\u2014much cheaper than gasoline. But charging stations are relatively expensive, and most EV charging is done at home. My younger brother drives his Ford C-Max Energi 100 electric miles a week. Every night he charges at home from a standard wall socket. The electricity is so cheap, he \u201ccannot tell the difference\u201d in his utility bill. But installing a Level 2 EV charger would cost about $1,500\u2014and more for a commercial user.\n\nThat said, public charging stations are incredibly important. They give people the peace of mind that they won\u2019t find themselves stranded without fuel. DC fast chargers are especially critical\u2014because they can fill your battery with a meaningful amount of juice within 15 or 20 minutes.\n\nLater this fall the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions will be releasing a study on business models for public charging infrastructure. Dan Welch, an EV analyst at the center, says, \u201cThe math is difficult for privately funded charging station operators.\u201d That\u2019s been clear for some time.\n\nBut for some reason, the Obama administration took a remarkably hands-off approach to charging infrastructure. As a result America has three incompatible fast-charger standards (Tesla, CHAdeMO, and SAE) and a dozen subscription-based services that generally let you charge only if you are a member. If these subscription-based chargers were all over the place, this would be less of a problem. Unfortunately, they\u2019re not. According to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, there are only about 2,565 fast chargers in the entire United States. Japan has more than twice that number packed into a landmass roughly the size of California\u2014with one dominant standard. The situation has gotten so bad that frustrated automakers like Nissan, BMW, and Tesla are installing their own charging stations.\n\nThe good news is that the Obama administration could get America back on track with just a small reallocation of federal budgets toward EV charging infrastructure\u2014and fast chargers in particular. Paltry investments in EV charging could be transformative. BMW sells a DC fast charger that costs only $6,458\u2014less than the tax break for a single EV. The unit still needs to be installed and maintained (which isn\u2019t cheap), but it provides a public refueling option for hundreds or thousands of EV drivers. For about $30 million, America could literally give 5,000 of these chargers to businesses, malls, convenience stores, and municipalities every single year. That would increase America\u2019s number of fast chargers by 200 percent in the first year.\n\nThis isn\u2019t a lot of money. The DOE\u2019s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy has a 2016 budget request of $2.7 billion\u2014with $444 million dedicated to vehicle technologies. So why not carve out a slice for fast chargers?\n\nAnother option would be to eliminate the tax credit for EVs over $50,000 and redirect those funds toward charging infrastructure. That would require help from Congress but would certainly pay dividends. In 2014 the tax cuts for Teslas alone were worth over $125 million\u2014that\u2019s a lot of fast chargers. And no one buying a $119,000 Tesla P90D needs a $7,500 tax break. Working with cities to update building codes could make it simple and cheap to install these chargers. And a few strategic modifications to utility rate structures would complete the equation.\n\nWhat makes this failure more frustrating is that all the other pieces are there: Automakers have built some really great electric cars. For instance, the Tesla P85D was so good, it \u201cbroke\u201d the Consumer Reports\u2019 ratings system. The BMW i3, which I was driving, is the perfect urban vehicle. Because of its unique carbon fiber architecture, it\u2019s as small as a compact car, with the spacious feel of a full-size sedan or crossover\u2014and the zip of a BMW. This year Nissan is rolling out a new Leaf with longer range, and there\u2019s huge buzz surrounding the 2016 Chevy Volt.\n\nBut it\u2019s still shockingly hard to charge in America. The day before my eVgo incident, I drove to a party in Maryland and tried to find a charger on the way back. After much searching, I finally found one in a Mercedes dealership, hidden next to a small tree. Unfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a fast charger. Still, I plugged in and sat\u2014hoping to gain a few electric miles. After 15 minutes the security guard rapped on my window and asked me to leave. I had gained approximately 1 mile.\n\nLater I hunted for a charger a few blocks from the White House. Finding one was virtually impossible. In Virginia the closest fast charger was so far that getting there and back would have drained my entire battery. Instead, I spent the weekend limping along on the i3\u2019s range extender\u2014a small internal combustion engine meant for just such circumstances. With only 50 miles of nonelectric range, I was constantly on the lookout for my next hit of oil.\n\nBut that\u2019s pretty much the state of EVs in America today. Most neighborhoods are a few wall sockets and fast chargers away from a convenient, reliable, environmentally friendly transportation alternative to oil.

According to the lawsuits, the main thing they learned in those three days was what they should say to convince credit card issuers to raise the credit limits on their cards. Why? They needed the money to fund their new businesses. Immediately. If that didn\u2019t work, they could also apply for new cards. Students were told they should remember to include \u201cprojected income\u201d when calculating household earnings on applications for new cards. What projected income, you might ask? Well, the real estate empires they would be setting up as soon as they left the class. But first \u2026\n\nAnd what happened next? What\u2019s known in the industry as the upsell, a pressure-heavy attempt to get consumers to buy in, and I mean that literally. Those attending Trump University\u2019s free seminar were repeatedly told they should sign up for a three-day seminar called \u201cThe Apprenticeship Program,\u201d costing $1,495, if they really wanted to get ahead.\n\nPeople were invited to a free\u2014or \u201cFREE,\u201d as the mailers advertising Trump University declared\u2014seminar, held in a local hotel like the Hilton Garden Inn in Greenbelt, Maryland, the Renaissance Glendale Hotel and Spa in suburban Phoenix, or the Doubletree in Berkeley, California. There, \u201chand-picked\u201d instructors would begin to school you in the intricacies of investing in real estate so that it could seem like a reasonable thing for someone to do.\n\nAs it turns out Trump University wasn\u2019t a university at all\u2014as New York state authorities pointed out, universities need charters. Instead, Trump University was something known as a wealth seminar, an insidious byproduct of our age of inequality and do-it-yourself financial planning.\n\nAnd finally, there are scores of unhappy former students, people like Kathleen Meese, a teacher and mother of a son with Down syndrome, who racked up $25,000 in debt to pay for her schooling after an instructor assured her she could earn the sum back within months. She couldn\u2019t. Then there is Nora Hann of Brooklyn, out $35,000, who last week told the New York Daily News , \u201cI went through hell and back,\u201d adding, \u201cThey\u2019re a bunch of frauds.\u201d\n\nTo say that Trump University did not deliver for many of its students is to indulge in understatement. New York state sued Trump and Trump University in 2013, alleging it had engaged in \u201cpersistent fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct.\u201d There\u2019s an ongoing class-action lawsuit in California, claiming the school was a \u201cfraudulent scheme.\u201d Trump University responded to yet another lawsuit by countersuing the lead claimant, alleging defamation.\n\nTen years ago Trump went into the for-profit education business. Ads for the new Trump University proclaimed the Donald\u2019s desire to share his business wisdom. \u201cJust copy exactly what I\u2019ve done and get rich,\u201d said one. Another claimed, \u201cI can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor.\u201d\n\nFor Donald Trump, it\u2019s never been enough to simply run a real estate empire. He emblazons his family name on just about everything he builds. He\u2019s been a tabloid fixture in New York for the better part of four decades. He\u2019s done time on reality television, bellowing out \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d on The Apprentice . He\u2019s even been involved in education.\n\nYes, another class! And another. And special mentoring. All of it could be yours\u2014for a price. That\u2019s the upsell. As laid out in a lawsuit filed by Tarla Makaeff, the California woman Trump University countersued, there was the Gold Elite package, costing $48,490, but available to attendees at the \u201cone day only\u201d special sale price of $34,995. If they couldn\u2019t afford that, Trump University also offered Silver Elite and Bronze Elite plans at a limited-time discount.\n\nAnd how should a student pay for that? Well, you remember that credit card, right?\n\nMany of those who signed up claim the mentorship was either spotty or nonexistent. As for the hand-picked, expert teachers? The California class action says that\u2019s not so. And when Los Angeles Times reporter David Lazarus attended a session of Trump University in 2007, he discovered his instructor had \u201chad his own home foreclosed upon.\u201d\n\nOn the plus side, there were no student loans offered.\n\nTrump University was not alone in allegedly embracing this sort of business model. The modern era of wealth seminars began in the early 1980s, basically running parallel with the worsening of income inequality, the explosion in easy credit, and federal regulatory changes that allowed television stations to more easily sell airtime to would-be gurus. One pioneer was Robert G. Allen, who pushed books like Nothing Down: How to Buy Real Estate With Little or Nothing Down.\n\nThe aughts brought us Robert Kiyosaki\u2019s Rich Dad, Poor Dad seminar empire, which was eerily similar to Trump University. Eager acolytes would be invited to a \u201cfree\u201d seminar located at a nearby hotel, where they would be regaled with tales of Kiyosaki\u2019s wealth and urged to sign up for a three-day seminar, usually related to real estate investing. (Rich Dad Education, either less greedy or more savvy than Trump, charged a mere $300 for its three-day class). This was so effective that the organization came to a $1 million settlement with the state of Florida in 2008 after, to quote from the press release announcing the deal, \u201cconsumers complained that the introductory programs and seminars, touted as training that would change careers and lifestyles and give persons financial freedom and independence, covered only very rudimentary information and were used mainly to entice consumers to purchase \u2018more advanced\u2019 and significantly more expensive training programs.\u201d When the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. show Marketplace signed up and sent a reporter off to the Rich Dad three-day seminar, the class was presented with a prepared script so attendees could call their credit card companies and have their limits raised to $100,000, supposedly for the first purchase, but, as a number of attendees suspected, as a way to pay for the next level of classes.\n\nSo why don\u2019t voters seem to care that Trump, a man worth an estimated $4 billion, according to Forbes, felt impelled to take five-figure sums of money from people like Meese? Well, first, Trump claims he did nothing wrong. He says the people complaining about his classes are a few scattered malcontents, and maintains a website claiming 98 percent of the people who enrolled in Trump University described the class as \u201cexcellent.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also possible that conservative voters are inured to this sort of stuff. Journalist Rick Perlstein has pointed out that any number of Republican politicians and talking heads seem to view their supporters as cash cows, selling their email lists to outfits marketing everything from miracle arthritis cures to surefire stock tips. The \u201clong con,\u201d Perlstein called it in the Baffler.\n\nAnd maybe we are all inured to this. After all, it\u2019s not like the real estate crash put the wealth seminar business out of business. True, Trump University, after changing its name to the Trump Entrepreneur Initiative, all but shut down in 2011. But no worries. You can still learn how to make a fortune betting on foreclosures, flips, and rental income schemes.\n\nThe latest real estate guru on the circuit? Former Flip This House star Armando Montelongo. His organization will offer free two-hour introductory sessions in more than three dozen metropolitan areas\u2014including Atlanta, New York, Dallas, and Colorado Springs\u2014over the next month. \u201cThe time is NOW to invest in real estate,\u201d his website proclaims. \u201cPosition yourself to start making money flipping houses in your area.\u201d\n\nIf you attend the class, you\u2019ll be urged to sign up for a three-day extended session, which costs, according to published reports, $1,496.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:23:05.092+0000"}

Today we have confirmation of that, courtesy of the conservative Tax Foundation.\n\nTo quickly review, Bush would drastically lower tax rates for both individuals and corporations, while eliminating loopholes and a number of popular deductions to make up some of the forgone revenue. The seven individual brackets we have today would be crunched down to just three, with rates of 28 percent, 25 percent, and 10 percent (currently, the top rate is 39.6 percent). Among other changes, he'd outright abolish the estate tax, which would be a boon to the Hilton family, and double the standard deduction most taxpayers take, which would help eliminate income tax liability altogether for millions of Americans. Meanwhile, he'd do away with the write-offs for state and local taxes, while capping them for things like mortgage interest and medical expenses. You get the flavor.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Tax Foundation, which even for a right-leaning organization is unusually optimistic about the ability of tax cuts to spur growth, thinks all this would do wonders for the economy. It predicts that, long-term, gross domestic product would be 10 percent higher under Bush's plan, wages would get a 7.4 percent boost, and that the country would tack on an extra 2.7 million jobs. Again, don't take these numbers as gospel\u2014as one economist memorably put it to the New York Times, some of the Tax Foundation's recent work \"would not pass muster as an undergraduate\u2019s model at a top university.\" The point is, they think that, like water from Moses' rock, the Jeb plan would unleash a gusher of growth, which would help make up for some of the revenue lost from lowering rates.\n\nBut even with those sunny assumptions, they find that the Jeb plan would still punch a massive hole in the budget. Assuming no extra growth, it would increase the deficit by $3.7 trillion over a decade. With their predictions about growth stirred in, the deficit would increase by $1.6 trillion. The problem is obvious: Wiping out deductions can't balance out the sorts of rate cuts and the wholesale elimination of things like the estate tax that Bush envisions.\n\n\n\nCourtesy of the Tax Foundation\n\nAnd who would benefit the most from all of this?

My mother, who is in her late 50s, was never very political until Donald Trump spewed his venomous ideas about immigration. Now she refers to him as \u201cmy man Donald.\u201d My mother works as a nurse in a clinic that caters to a mostly poor population, many of whom are Hispanic. She now thinks that anyone who speaks Spanish or who is of Latino origin is an illegal immigrant. She constantly posts things on Facebook like \u201cWhen my man Donald is President, I won't have to deal with anymore illegals and anchor babies at [name of her workplace.]\u201d I keep warning her that she could be fired for that, which would be especially bad because she would lose her pension and is less than five years away from retirement, but she rebukes me. She speaks like this in public, trying to get people to react or agree. It makes me sick. I am a teacher and work with a poor Hispanic population. I love all of my kids and know their day-to-day struggles; I try so hard to be a positive role model in their lives and someone they can trust. My mother speaks her hateful views more each time I talk to or am around her. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I cannot stand to be around my mother anymore. Can you offer any advice on how to deal with her or what to do to avoid her? I can\u2019t imagine living this way until next year\u2019s election.\n\n\u2014Democrat Daughter\n\nDear Daughter,\n\nSince your mother has such contempt for the people she is supposed to serve, it might be good for everyone if she lost her job. I am baffled at the polling numbers for Donald Trump, raging narcissist, but in your mother\u2019s case, it sounds as if her political awakening could be a possible sign of a medical problem. If a previously apolitical person is mouthing off and posting on social media in a way that disparages her patients and puts her job and financial future in jeopardy, then something is off. You are describing a fairly drastic change in personality, so I think it\u2019s worth persuading your mother to get a complete checkup. Please do let us know if the cause of her crush on the Donald is a brain tumor. (Note to Donald: I\u2019m not menstruating.) But if Mom is fine and she\u2019s just responding to Trump\u2019s fantasies of an America sans Spanish speakers, then you need to have a blunt talk with her. Tell her what she\u2019s been saying makes you sick, and you and your mother need to agree to go back to Donald-free discussions or else you two are on hiatus until Trump is no longer politically relevant. Add that if he\u2019s elected president, you will endure an epic gloating session. Say that you\u2019re cutting off your social media connections to her so you don\u2019t have to read her rants. Explain to her that of course she\u2019s entitled to her own views, but when she expresses them publicly, and especially electronically, she\u2019s potentially creating grounds for dismissal and the loss of her pension. Let her know that if that happens, you will be unable to financially bail her out. Let\u2019s hope \u201cher man\u201d craters soon for her sake, yours, and the country\u2019s.\n\n\u2014Prudie\n\nDear Prudence,\n\nI am a 16-year-old male high school student. I have a longtime friend, \u201cJennifer.\u201d The two of us aren\u2019t particularly outgoing socially, and we tend to do everything together. Jennifer recently expressed a desire for a romantic relationship, which I dealt with poorly. I mumbled something about not wishing to ruin a longtime and meaningful friendship over a short-term decision. Since then, however, I can\u2019t get the idea of a romantic relationship with her out of my head. The problem is that Jennifer\u2019s idea of dating is essentially what we\u2019ve been doing for the past five years. She has an overall fear of sex and physical intimacy, as well as legitimate concerns about pregnancy and STDs. But without a physical relationship, I can\u2019t see a difference between our friendship and romance. I feel like a horrible person because of this, and I really don\u2019t want to be the creepy guy who prods her into sex when she doesn\u2019t want it or isn\u2019t ready. I\u2019m annoyed at myself that I\u2019m even having quasi-manipulative thoughts, especially about such a dear friend. Should I go back to ignoring the whole thing? Attempt to have a lengthy discussion with her? Or do I deserve a reprimand for thinking about this at all?\n\n\u2014Blurred Line\n\nDear Blurred,\n\nLet\u2019s hope we haven\u2019t arrived at the point at which a 16-year-old boy needs to self-flagellate for thinking about sex with a female classmate, especially one who has expressed romantic interest in him. You actually deserve kudos for recognizing your perfectly normal desire but wanting to be sure you never pressure or manipulate a partner into sex. And let\u2019s give props to Jennifer. She overcame what must have been serious sweaty palms and heart palpitations to make her bold suggestion. You did not handle this situation poorly. Even middle-aged people would find it awkward to deflect the expressed romantic desire of a longtime friend. You were kind and respectful, and your answer allowed this friendship to continue. But let\u2019s say you and Jennifer did explore a romance. I agree that would mean adding a physical component to your friendship\u2014but that can be a lot of things short of intercourse. It could be that despite her expressed concerns about sex, she\u2019d actually like you to kiss her. So I think you need to revisit Jennifer\u2019s suggestion. Have a follow-up talk in which you say you\u2019ve been thinking a lot about what she said and you\u2019re intrigued and flattered. If you try romance, approach it with the idea of being sensitive to your partner\u2019s desires. Respecting her limits won\u2019t prevent all awkwardness\u2014awkwardness is inevitable\u2014but it will keep you from being a jerk.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:23:36.875+0000"}

But less expected was that the antipathy spread even more profoundly to members of the Republican leadership.\n\n\u201cObama is a black, Jew-hating, jihadist putting America and Israel and the rest of the planet in grave danger,\u201d said Bob Kunst of Miami. Kunst\u2014pairing a Hillary Clinton rubber mask with a blue T-shirt reading \u201cINFIDEL\u201d\u2014was holding one sign that accused Obama, Hillary Clinton, and John Kerry of \u201cFulfilling Hitler\u2019s Dreams\u201d and another that queried, \u201cDIDN\u2019T WE LEARN ANYTHING FROM 1938?\u201d His only reassurance was that, when Iran launches its attack on the mainland, it\u2019ll be stopped quickly by America\u2019s heavily armed citizenry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNot every attendee or speaker at the rally, organized by the Tea Party Patriots, was as colorful as Kunst. As with many right-wing rallies during the Obama era\u2014though this is the rare occasion that dealt with a foreign policy agreement\u2014normally dressed citizens concerned about policy consequences were intermixed with howling conservative activists carrying bombastic, crude signs. One of most common placards came in several versions with different legislators\u2019 names\u2014Sen. Ed Markey, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and so on\u2014inscribed on a drawing of a first-generation atomic bomb under which read, \u201cWill your name be on Iran\u2019s bomb?\u201d\n\nThe Stop the Iran Deal Rally felt more like a coda for a failed summer campaign to scuttle the deal than a useful means of accomplishing anything.\n\nBut both Markey and Klobuchar have already signaled their support for the Joint Plan of Action, along with 40 other Democratic and independent senators. Under the Corker\u2013Cardin framework for debating the nuclear agreement, that\u2019s enough to successfully filibuster any attempt to prevent President Obama from waiving nuclear sanctions on Iran. The deal will go through.\n\nSo shouldn\u2019t a rally of this nature have been held, say, in late July, before Obama had the votes he needed? \u201cThat would have been preferable,\u201d said Bill from Damascus, Maryland.\n\nHeading into Wednesday afternoon, the Stop the Iran Deal Rally felt more like a coda for a failed summer campaign to scuttle the deal than a useful means of accomplishing anything. The deal\u2019s grassroots opponents originally seemed to believe that members would be so overwhelmed with protests against the accord when they were home for their August recess that nary a one would dare return to Washington and allow the administration\u2019s deal to skirt through. But even though the deal polls abysmally, the administration was able to successfully whip nearly all Senate Democrats in its favor. It will be implemented now\u2014that is, until at least January 2017, when President Marco Rubio or Scott Walker tears it up on Day 1, or President Trump begins the process of \u201crenegotiating\u201d it in a way that Makes America Great Again.\n\nBut try telling that to these folks. And especially try telling them that Congress, specifically the Republican leaders in Sen. Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner, have no tools at their disposal to stop it.\n\nThat\u2019s how Tea Party Patriots and other affiliated groups conveniently shifted the focus of their rally once Senate supporters crossed the threshold of 34 votes last week: The deal will only go through if the Republican establishment allows it to pass. President Obama may \u201cmake Neville Chamberlain look like George Patton,\u201d in the words of right-wing talk radio personality Mark Levin, but the Republican leaders would be even worse by allowing him to get away with it.\n\nFreshman Rep. Dave Brat, aka the Cantor Slayer, elicited stronger boos by mentioning the names \u201cMcConnell and Boehner\u201d than any mention of the name \u201cObama\u201d did all day. \u201cLeadership got us into this mess, and they\u2019re the only ones who can get us out,\u201d he said to cheers, as music began to play signaling that his brief speaking window had closed. \u201cThe situation we\u2019re in is a product of weak leadership.\u201d\n\nFrank Gaffney, the former Reagan administration Defense Department official who has since built a career trafficking in entertainingly grim paranoia, declared that \u201cif Republican leaders in the Senate and House do not stop the deal\u2014which they can\u2014their names will be on the bombs.\u201d Right there with Sens. Markey, Klobuchar, and the rest.\n\nThe plan they\u2019re alluding to is a fast-moving one that, within the past 48 hours, has sent congressional Republicans into chaos. \u201cAll that has to happen,\u201d Sen. Ted Cruz said to the crowd, \u201cis for Mitch McConnell and John Boehner to say the review period hasn\u2019t started.\u201d This alludes to a push by Rep. Peter Roskam and other conservatives wherein Republican leaders would argue that Obama has not presented the \u201cfull\u201d nuclear agreement before Congress; it doesn\u2019t include, as Politico reports, \u201cso-called \u2018side deals\u2019 that were hashed out between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency.\u201d Until those presumably nefarious \u201cside deals\u201d are sent, the logic goes, the 60-day review period hasn\u2019t begun, and deal opponents will have more time to sway legislators to their side.\n\nHouse Republican leaders were discussing shifting strategy with the rank-and-file Wednesday afternoon as the rally was going on. As Politico adds, though, \u201cWhatever course House Republicans choose will have almost no practical impact.\u201d McConnell and Corker have been cool to the idea, as it might lead to Congress never registering its disapproval of the deal at all. The 60-day period will expire on Sept. 17, and the White House will begin implementing the deal.\n\nWhat the Roskam plan does effectively do, though, is paper over the fact that Congress never could do much to stop this deal with the potent anti-establishment politics that blossomed during the Summer of Trump. Lawmakers who railed against this deal, and now recognize that it\u2019s going through anyway, will transfer the rage of activists like those at Wednesday\u2019s rally toward those familiar spineless, all-talk-no-action, cowardly punching bags, Boehner and McConnell.\n\nAnd it will work. Not because Boehner and McConnell (and Corker) didn\u2019t make an effort, as they\u2019ll be accused of. The Corker\u2013Cardin framework gave opponents a chance to kill the deal through Congress\u2014a long shot, sure, but better than the alternative, which would have been the deal going through with zero congressional input. But they\u2019re the highest-ranking GOP officials in government right now, and GOP voters unfamiliar with nitpicky federal government procedures will be perfectly willing to blame them for \u201callowing\u201d this to happen.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:23:41.258+0000"}
{"entityId": 32, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Adam Bettcher/Getty Images\n\nHillary Clinton owes a small thank-you to the Republican Party.\n\nHer great challenge as a candidate\u2014and nominee, should she win the Democratic primary\u2014is to show continuity with the Obama administration without losing her distinctive voice. Even if she shares policies with the current president, her White House can\u2019t be a third term for Barack Obama; the public wants a new vision. That\u2019s especially true on foreign policy: Americans are consistently down on the administration\u2019s approach to issues abroad\u2014from ISIS to chaos in Syria\u2014and support a more active strategy for facing foreign threats.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPolls bear this out. On average, since the beginning of last year, 50 percent of Americans have disagreed with Obama\u2019s handling of foreign policy, while only 38 percent have approved of it. Fifty-four percent of Americans don\u2019t think Obama is tough enough on foreign affairs and national security, and 48 percent say the United States is less important and powerful than it was a decade ago. On the Iran deal, 49 percent disapprove of the plan to monitor Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities and lift international sanctions, while only 21 percent approve. Thirty percent don\u2019t know enough to say either way.\n\nEnter Republicans. Despite the advantage in public opinion, they\u2019ve had a hard time offering a sharp foreign policy critique, in part because they refuse to budge from the worst ideas and strategies of the last GOP administration.\n\nThe public wants a more active foreign policy. But it isn\u2019t interested in reckless confrontation.\n\nIran is instructive. At every step of the argument over the nuclear agreement, Republicans have pushed maximum confrontation at the expense of diplomacy, rejecting the deal without offering an alternative. If elected president, for example, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio would renege on the deal and reimpose sanctions, as would Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton thinks we should reject the deal in favor of a \u201ccredible threat of military force,\u201d and Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk compared the Iran deal to Nazi appeasement. \u201cThis is the greatest appeasement since Chamberlain gave Czechoslovakia to Hitler,\u201d he said. The most flamboyant assault on the Iran deal came Wednesday, when Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz gathered with hundreds of supporters to blast the administration. If the deal goes through, Cruz argued, Obama would \u201cquite literally be the world\u2019s largest financier of radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d\n\nYes, the public wants a more active foreign policy. But it isn\u2019t interested in reckless confrontation. People remember the last war, and aren\u2019t thrilled with the chance for another one. To that point, 59 percent of Americans still think the Iraq war was a mistake, and 55 percent oppose putting ground troops back in the country. What\u2019s more, about half of Americans are wary of too much foreign involvement. Put differently, the public wants an alternative, and it isn\u2019t the GOP.\n\nWhich brings us back to Clinton. If Republicans represent the right wing of the mainstream debate on foreign policy, and if Obama represents the left, then Clinton is well-placed to stand in the center as a tough but diplomatic leader. And on Wednesday she staked that ground with a speech in support of the Iran deal. Speaking to a small audience at the Brookings Institution, Clinton\u2014who helped pave the way for the initial negotiations\u2014gave her vision for implementing the deal and containing Iran in the future. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start looking ahead to what comes next: enforcing it, deterring Iran and its proxies, and strengthening our allies,\u201d she said. Clinton promised to continue and expand military aid to Israel; to build a \u201ccoalition to counter Iran\u2019s proxies\u201d like Hamas and Hezbollah; and to \u201cnot hesitate to take military action\u201d if Iran pursues a nuclear weapon in violation of the deal. \u201cWe need to be clear-eyed about what we can expect from Iran,\u201d she said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t the start of some broader diplomatic opening. And we shouldn\u2019t expect that this deal will lead to a broader change in their behavior.\u201d\n\nThis is more hawkish than most rhetoric from President Obama and reflects her long comfort with using force, from voting for the war in Iraq to pushing action in Syria, which Obama ultimately rejected. In a Democratic primary, as Clinton learned in 2008, this is a liability. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is running on left-wing economic policy, but there\u2019s space to critique Clinton on foreign policy and win votes from the anti-war left.\n\nWith that said, Clinton\u2019s approach may be the right tack for a general election. Again, voters want change. But they support diplomacy and don\u2019t want another war or occupation. Clinton offers a third way: Obama-style policies merged with hawkish rhetoric. It satisfies the public but keeps Clinton to the left of the Republican Party, and clears her path for attacks on GOP candidates. Which, incidentally, is what she did. \u201cThat\u2019s not leadership, that\u2019s recklessness,\u201d said Clinton of Republican rhetoric. \u201cIt would set us right down the very dangerous path we\u2019ve worked so hard to avoid. \u2026 Great powers can\u2019t just jump agreements and expect the rest of the world to go along with us.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:23:44.830+0000"}

The rally, organized by Tea Party Patriots, the Zionist Organization of America, and the Center for Security Policy, featured speakers ranging in expertise, from Sarah Palin to former CIA Director James Woolsey to Duck Dynasty\u2019s Phil Robertson. Former Virginia governor and way-long-shot presidential candidate Jim Gilmore was also there. (I overheard at least one spectator asking who he was.) But Trump and Cruz were the main draw.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been doing deals for a long time, I\u2019ve been making lots of deals, wonderful deals.

They will be back before I ever take office because [Iran\u2019s leaders] know that\u2019s what has to happen.\u201d This was likely a reference to Iran\u2019s release of American hostages on the day Ronald Reagan took office, an event frequently, if misleadingly, invoked by Republicans to demonstrate the importance of credibility in foreign policy. Moving quickly to other topics, Trump promised the enthusiastic crowd, \u201cwe will have so much winning if I get elected, that you may get bored with winning.\u201d The crowd seemed to be eating it up.\n\nCruz\u2019s attack was more detailed. Repeating one of his favorite talking points, he said that the deal would make Barack Obama \u201cquite literally the world\u2019s leading financier of radical Islamic terrorism.\u201d He invoked the specter of Iran using a nuclear weapon in an electromagnetic pulse attack, also a favorite hobbyhorse of rally organizer and fellow speaker Frank Gaffney of the Center for Security Policy.\n\nAlong with several other speakers, Cruz noted that the deal will lift some sanctions on Quds force commander Qassem Suleimani, who has been accused of supplying weapons used to kill American troops in Iraq. \u201cHow do you look a mom in the eyes and say I voted to lift sanctions on the man who murdered your sons when they were defending this nation?\u201d he asked of the members of Congress currently considering the deal. (The discussion of Suleimani may have been a little awkward for Trump, who was stumped on a question about the Iranian general in a recent interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt.) \u201cWe know to an absolute certainty that people will die\u201d if the deal goes through, Cruz said.\n\nCruz also came armed with zingers, quipping that when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu \u201csays \u2018existential,\u2019 he doesn\u2019t mean a bunch of Frenchmen in black berets chain-smoking.\u201d\n\nCruz put much of the blame on Republican leaders in Congress for allowing the vote to go forward, arguing that the congressional review period for the bill shouldn\u2019t actually begin until the White House presents the secret \u201cside agreements\u201d between Iran and the IAEA to Congress. (Several signs in the crowd accused Mitch McConnell and John Boehner of being traitors.) But he also acknowledged, correctly, that the best chance Republicans have of scrapping the deal is winning the White House next year.\n\n\u201cIf the Republican leadership decides that a show vote is more important than stopping this deal, then the single most important issue in 2016 will be stopping Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon,\u201d he said. \u201cAny commander-in-chief worthy of defending this nation should be prepared to stand up on January 20, 2017 and rip to shreds this catastrophic deal.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:23:47.438+0000"}

Despite this, they make informed, careful, and autonomous decisions to go through with their procedures. Where do you go after a thought like that? Certainly not to your priest. The Catechism of the Catholic Church states that any woman procuring an abortion shall be excommunicated from the church. Nearly 30 percent of all women obtaining abortions are Catholic.

It\u2019s a \u201ctell no one what you\u2019ve done, and you\u2019re going to hell anyway\u201d policy.\n\nA Catholic patient once asked me, right before undergoing her abortion: \u201cAre you going to judge me for this?\u201d After I told her no, of course not, she then confessed, \u201cI\u2019m worried I\u2019m going to die during the procedure because you\u2019re judging me.\u201d It doesn\u2019t get much heavier than that, except for this last experience.\n\nI once cared for a woman whose fetus had died midpregnancy and who needed an abortion procedure. Because this was a very desired pregnancy and because of her very deep Catholic roots, she called in a priest to baptize the fetal remains. In full sterile attire, the priest performed both the rite of baptism and then the last rites in a combined baptism/funeral service. He didn\u2019t ask any questions about what had happened or how we had all gotten there. He only offered peace and forgiveness to this suffering woman and her family.\n\nIf this is what the Pope is hoping to promote\u2014elimination of the staunch belief that abortion should never be allowed\u2014then I\u2019m listening, but something tells me this is too good to be true. Like Patricia Miller writes in her book Good Catholics: The Battle Over Abortion in the Catholic Church, everything you need to know about the Catholic Church and women can be ascertained from the front doors of St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in New York City. The only women worth immortalizing in bronze are Kateri Tekakwitha (the virgin), Elizabeth Ann Seton (the saint), and Mother Cabrini (the nun). This is the ideal woman: chaste, selfless, and a servant to others. Sexuality is entirely inappropriate, and therefore obviously so are contraception and abortion. That\u2019s a difficult doctrine to break, and likely not the Pope\u2019s intent.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:01.055+0000"}

But women still need abortions and will move heaven and earth to get them. Molly Redden of Mother Jones traveled across the country visiting clinics to see how new regulations have impacted clinics' ability to provide care and how they've changed the experience of obtaining an abortion. \"The onslaught of new abortion restrictions has been so successful, so strategically designed, and so well coordinated,\" Redden writes, that the fight for abortion access \"in many places has essentially been lost.\"\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nThe travel and work-loss burdens that add hundreds or thousands of dollars in costs have been well-documented. But what is less reported\u2014until Redden's piece\u2014is how the new regulations make getting an abortion as pointlessly frightening as possible. Texas and 24 other states have passed laws requiring that abortions only be performed in \"ambulatory surgical centers.\" On paper, it doesn't sound so bad; in practice, it would be comical if it weren't so cruel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFirst-trimester abortions typically should be done in a normal doctor's office, in the same room you might get something like a cervical biopsy. But this is what clinics have to look like in these 25 states:\n\n[Planned Parenthood director of government relations Kelly] Hart clicks through the door of an operating theater. It's about the size of a starter apartment, and it's slightly cozier than a meat locker. Planned Parenthood wanted to decorate the barren white walls with art. But ASC rules about dust control caused staff to reconsider. Above us, a set of cryptic-looking nozzles, for pumping nitrous oxide and compressed air, jut out from the ceiling like high-tech stalactites. \"It's frightening, isn't it?\" Hart says. \"And there's just no reason for that.\" None of them have hoses attached; the doctors don't need what they pump. At the nurses' station, a row of blinking orange lights alerts us that the supplies are low.\n\n\"Women wait for their turn in a reception area\" in normal clinics, Redden writes, \"and they wear their own clothes. But in surgical centers like this one, all the patients are naked beneath their hospital gowns.\" In normal clinics, nurses wear scrubs but are emotionally available to patients, ready to hold hands and smile at them. Under the new regulations, \"nurses disappear beneath bonnets and booties and surgical masks.\"\n\nAnti-choicers claim these regulations are for safety, but abortion was already 40 times safer than a colonoscopy. The real purpose of these regulations is to make the patient believe that what she is undergoing is major surgery. The intended message is that abortion is dangerous and traumatic, especially compared with childbirth.\n\nFirst-trimester abortion is easy. Early term pregnancies often abort on all on their own. For a vacuum-aspiration abortion, you're in the stirrups for 10 to 15 minutes, usually with a local anesthetic. There is no cutting involved. For a medication abortion, you take a pill and go home, ready to expel what is going to look like a heavy period. You may need an aspirin. This is not heart surgery, but the regulations are clearly meant to make you think otherwise\u2014and to be afraid.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:02.925+0000"}

{"entityId": 38, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Tony Karumba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nExperts have been issuing dire predictions for years that the effects of climate change will eventually lead to an unprecedented number of displaced people. And while the ongoing refugee crisis in Europe has been sparked primarily by violence in the Middle East and North Africa, it has prompted some to ask whether the era of climate refugees has already begun.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nTo the extent it has entered the public consciousness, the term climate refugee tends to conjure images of Pacific Islanders or people living near the coast of Bangladesh, heading for higher ground when their homes disappear. But it is worth considering whether what we are witnessing in Europe today is the beginning of the climate refugee wave. This raises the tricky issue of how to disentangle overlapping causes of conflict and displacement. Most people displaced by climate change will not be displaced just by climate change. Will we be able to recognize a climate-caused humanitarian crisis when we see it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSyrians, displaced by the brutal fighting that has wracked their country since 2011, are the largest group among those attempting to reach Europe. Including those displaced within the country, more than half of Syria\u2019s population has been uprooted since the war began, and Syrians are almost single-handedly driving the recent uptick in displaced people around the world. A number of studies have suggested that factors related to global warming, notably a prolonged crippling drought that drove a mass migration of rural workers into Syrian cities between 2006 and 2009. This influx added to other social stresses that led to the 2011 uprising against Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government, which preceded the civil war. And it\u2019s not a coincidence that control of water supplies has been a major strategic priority of the multiple groups fighting in Iraq and Syria, including ISIS.\n\nWill we be able to recognize a climate-caused humanitarian crisis when we see it?\n\nDrought is obviously only one of the factors that led to the war in Syria. I\u2019m uncomfortable with any theory that downplays the specific decisions of the Syrians who rose up against the government and a leader who would rather gas and barrel bomb his own people than give up power. But more than one thing can be true. Violence can be caused by human folly and cruelty as well as driven by structural factors. There are numerous examples of access to food and water exacerbating underlying tensions and driving political instability. If we accept that this is happening to some extent in Syria, then many of the refugees making the northward journey over the Adriatic or up through the Balkans are, in some sense, climate refugees.\n\nThe link is a bit stronger when it comes to the those fleeing Eritrea and Somalia, who account for a great number of those traveling the dangerous \u201ccentral Mediterranean route\u201d from Libya to Italy and Malta, where some of the crisis\u2019 deadliest tragedies have occurred. Scientists have linked worsening droughts in Northern Africa to the substantial recent rapid warming of the Indian Ocean. Like Syria, Somalia experienced a devastating drought in 2011; this year, an early end to the rainy season and a poor harvest have caused a 17 percent increase in people in food crisis. Two-thirds of those people are internally displaced. Despite official denials and a dearth of reliable statistics about the isolated country\u2019s authoritarian government, Eritrea is also believed to have been badly affected by recent droughts.\n\nAgain, the weather is not the only factor driving this migration. Somalia has been in a state of ongoing internal conflict since the late 1980s. Eritrea has one of the most repressive governments on Earth and many of those who leave are fleeing the country\u2019s abusive forced conscription system. The chaos in Libya since the fall of Muammar al-Qaddafi has also opened a previously closed route north. But changing weather patterns are almost undoubtedly playing a role in displacement as well. As an elderly Eritrean farmer in an Ethiopian refugee camp quoted in a 2012 report by the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees put it, \u201cThe weather has become odder and odder. There used to be floods but today there are no floods. People suffer from famine during the droughts. If there is an absence of rain, nobody can do anything\u2014it is a decision of God.\u201d The report found that most people displaced solely by environmental factors stay within the border of their own countries, but when these factors are combined with ongoing violence, people flee for uncertain sanctuary abroad.\n\nThere are signs elsewhere of climate playing an increasing role in human migration. A surge in undocumented immigrants from Central American countries like Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, crossing the southern U.S. border, received national attention last year after the arrival of thousands of unaccompanied minors. Those migrants left their home countries after catastrophic crop failures put thousands at risk of food insecurity. In the United States, they\u2019re rarely seen as refugees at all, never mind climate refugees. In the years to come, nations and bodies will have to decide whether those forced to flee by environmental factors should be accorded the same refugee status as those displaced by war or political oppression.\n\nTo some degree, when you\u2019re looking for them, every refugee starts to look like a climate refugee. The world faced massive surges of displaced people crossing borders long before climate change, after all, and in none of the cases above is climate the sole or even the primary cause. But the difficulty in drawing the line between \u201crefugee\u201d and \u201cclimate refugee\u201d is itself telling.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:09.456+0000"}

Spiritually, it's a sort of watered-down cousin of his GOP opponent Marco Rubio's \"puppies and rainbows\" approach to reforming the IRS code. Rather than choose between cutting rates for high earners (as old-school Republican supply-siders would prefer) and targeting relief to the middle class (as new-wave Republican reformacons would like), Bush chooses to hand out goodies to just about everybody. Among other things, he would:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCut the seven tax brackets we have today down to three, with lower rates of 28, 25, and 10 percent (today, the top rate is 39.6 percent).*\n\n\n\nDouble the standard deduction taken by most filers.\n\n\n\nIncrease the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps low-wage workers.\n\nEliminate the inheritance tax, which would help the very, very rich.\n\n\n\nKill the marriage penalty.\n\nSlash corporate rates to 20 percent (from today's top rate of 35 percent) and let businesses expense capital investments immediately (sounds wonky, but it's a big deal).\n\nIn the end, wealthy taxpayers and companies get lower rates, while Bush says more than 15 million additional people would owe no federal income taxes at all. You get a tax cut! And you get a tax cut! And you get a tax cut!\n\nAnd how would he pay for all this? Well, for one, he's following Donald Trump's populist example by vowing to do away with the carried interest loophole that benefits rich private equity fund managers. But mostly, he'd just cap unnamed \"deductions used by the wealthy and Washington special interests.\" Easy as that.\n\nThe thing is, there are only so many savings to be found in sweeping away those assorted breaks, and probably not enough to balance the budget (as Bush claims he would like to do) while doling out new cuts left and right. To figure that out, all you have to do is look at the old Simpson-Bowles tax plan, which, while also eliminating all sorts of personal exemptions, had to jack up taxes on investment income, which Bush doesn't, in order to fund similar, and in some respects more modest, cuts elsewhere.\n\nOf course, that could simply mean Bush is planning to cut government spending more than Simpson-Bowles envisioned. Or, it could mean he's making some magical assumptions that tax cuts will help spur breakneck economic growth capable of producing all the revenue Washington needs. Right now it seems an awful lot like the latter. Combined with industry deregulation, immigration reform, greater energy production, and an improved education system, Bush argues that tax reform \u201cwill unleash increased investment, higher wages and sustained 4% economic growth, while reducing the deficit.\u201d\n\nSo, I underestimated the man. It turns out his heroic predictions about taxes, growth, and the deficit also involve some mumbling about education and oil.

That\u2019s a shame. There\u2019s much to be mined by comparing the two billionaires.\n\nLike Trump, Perot built his campaign on opposition to bad trade deals. He also harnessed public anger at the political ruling class and the special-interest money that fueled their campaigns. Like Trump, Perot boasted that he took no outside money and pointed to his pledge to self-finance as proof that he couldn\u2019t be bought.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPerot was the first talk-show candidate, effectively announcing on Larry King Live in February 1992. He took advantage of the venue, where he could speak with less of a filter. He also bought infomercials to speak directly to voters. Trump, the first reality-show candidate, has taken advantage of a similar media environment that allows him to speak freely to voters.\n\nWhen Perot spoke of the problems in Washington, he offered Trump-like certainty about how easily they could be solved by someone who had come from the real world of business. \u201cI can solve the problem of the national debt without working up a sweat,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nOne of the great moments of his outsider campaign came in the first debate with Bill Clinton and President George H.W. Bush when both men suggested Perot lacked the political experience necessary to make progress. Perot responded by saying it\u2019s true he didn\u2019t have any experience. \u201cI don\u2019t have any experience in gridlock government, where nobody takes any responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don't have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent, crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. ... I\u2019ve got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem.\u201d\n\nIf Trump doesn\u2019t steal this line of argument for the next debate, he should dock his own pay.\n\nDespite the similarities, it\u2019s the differences between Perot and Trump that are the most illuminating. Perot enjoyed a healthy ego like Trump, but unlike the real estate magnate, he ran on a platform of something more than his skill. As an answer to the public dissatisfaction with Washington politicians, Perot offered a specific reform agenda that included term limits for members of Congress, a balanced budget amendment, and national referenda in which voters would be allowed a direct say in making laws by putting them on a national ballot.\n\nDespite the similarities, it\u2019s the differences between Perot and Trump that are the most illuminating.\n\nPerot was selling a specific set of guardrails that would ensure a stronger relationship between lawmakers and the people. Trump is offering a one-time personality sale. Voters just have to hope that he gets it right and that Congress snaps into shape. Perot was selling a system that was in keeping with the founding principles of the country (and concerns of the founders), and it would guard against the megalomania of politicians. Trump\u2019s candidacy encourages the cult of personality by putting the whole bundle in one candidate.\n\nBoth Perot\u2019s and Trump\u2019s plans for government mirrored their personalities and their business careers. Trump is founded on Trump, who credits bravado as a key tool in selling his prowess. \u201cThe final key to the way I promote is bravado,\u201d Trump wrote in The Art of the Deal. \u201cI play to people\u2019s fantasies. That\u2019s why a little hyperbole never hurts.\u201d His presidential campaign operates on a similar principle.\n\nPerot, on the other hand, was a just-the-facts businessman who made his fortune by selling his information technology equipment and services company to General Motors. In keeping with that vision and his Eagle Scout and U.S. Naval Academy training, Perot was addicted to facts. His chart-laden infomercials sought to inform voters on every particular, from the size of the U.S. trade deficit to the imbalance in CEO pay.\n\nPerot believed in making a painstaking argument to the American people. Trump, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t think facts are so important. It must be said that he has offered the most specific immigration plan of any of the candidates since they made their campaign declarations, but his general principle about the relationship between what he must tell voters and what they expect he\u2019ll do is pretty loose. \u201cI think the press is more eager to see it than the voters, to be honest,\u201d Trump said last month in Iowa when asked when he might release a detailed immigration plan. \u201cI think the voters like me, they understand me, they know I\u2019m going to do the job. ...

The self-obsessed, conservative savant that Colbert had played for nearly a decade on The Report was not making the transition to CBS. What would Stephen Colbert be like as Stephen Colbert, late night host, and not Stephen Colbert, political demagogue? Could the former really be as entertaining as the latter?\n\nWilla Paskin Willa Paskin is Slate\u2019s television critic.\n\nThe answers, at least as offered by the first episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, are very promising. Colbert was so ecstatic to be hosting his new show he couldn\u2019t contain his excitement; it kept bubbling over into dance. And yet even in all his jubilation, there was still a bit of archness, a little wink, that trademark schmear of Colbertian irony slathered on every bit of the night. Unlike NBC\u2019s Jimmy Fallon, who made a cameo in the episode, Colbert does not do unfettered earnestness. Unlike ABC\u2019s Jimmy Kimmel, he does not do exasperated jadedness. As Colbert explained to Jeb Bush, who had remarked on all the pictures of Colbert on the Ed Sullivan theater ceiling, \u201cI used to play a narcissistic conservative candidate, now I\u2019m just a narcissist.\u201d The new Colbert is different from the old Colbert, but he is still a part of him. With Colbert there will always be a distance between the performance and the intelligence of the performer, and it\u2019s in that space that the audience is meant to luxuriate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLate-night is a stodgy format, where a host\u2019s decision to sit, instead of stand, constitutes controversial decision-making. Colbert\u2019s first episode generally stuck to late-night conventions\u2014the monologue, banter from behind a desk, interviews, and band were all present and accounted for\u2014but it tweaked and teased them in heartening ways, especially for a debut. The show looked and felt like late night, but a more wild, antic, theatrical version, especially once Colbert got off his feet and got behind that desk.\n\nInstead of rattling off one-liners about the latest headlines, Colbert took his time on Donald Trump. He treated Trump jokes like Oreo cookies, of which it is impossible to enjoy just one. Colbert\u2019s Trump riff was not Colbert at his most incisive\u2014Donald Trump has been compared to an Oompa-Loompa before\u2014but the segment immediately set Colbert apart from his competition. Colbert can do something the Jimmys can\u2019t: he can act. He can do physical comedy\u2014smashing Oreo after Oreo into his mouth\u2014and he can feign heated emotions, a la the man who just can\u2019t stop telling Trump jokes or smashing Oreos into his mouth. It\u2019s late-night melded with some first-rate theater.\n\nThe Trump bit was preceded by something stranger and more original. As Colbert was telling audiences about the memorabilia on set, a growling interrupted him: a horned amulet he had previously pointed out was acting up. Colbert went on to explain that, \u201cin exchange for getting this show, I swore a blood debt\u2026 I am enslaved to its drone and must make certain regrettable compromises.\u201d The amulet, in this case, was demanding that he plug Sabra, the night\u2019s sponsor. (Watching, I wondered if Colbert did, in fact, have to do product placement for Sabra, or if he had just wanted to do this oddball segment\u2014which is a sign of very good product placement indeed.) I\u2019m sure some people were perplexed by this bit, but I loved it. It was like a late-night troll doll: shaggy, baggy, odd, adorable only to some people. It was so intentionally weird it underlined the episode\u2019s confidence in itself and its star: Colbert can pull off anything.\n\nThe episode\u2019s other highlight was Colbert\u2019s interview with Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. It was exactly the sort of high-degree of difficulty interview only Colbert does: substantive and challenging and clever and funny. Colbert thanked Bush for coming, and then began tossing screwballs and fastballs at him. Does Jeb really think he can bring people together? Why is his slogan \u201cJeb!\u201d? Colbert took his time to gently set up a pointed question about how Jeb differs from his brother, by sharing the ways Colbert differs from his own brother, who was in the audience. As Colbert was flinging out questions, he was also peppering Jeb with hard to parse compliments like \u201cThere is a non-zero chance I would vote for you.\u201d It was entertaining and punchy: politicians who are not quick on their feet will probably think twice before appearing on The Late Show.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:13.628+0000"}

(On Tuesday, she finally apologized for her unusual setup, but only after several days of awkward refusals). Her attempts to play the heartstrings have also been out of tune. (The Times suggests that she\u2019ll no longer mention her granddaughter at every opportunity \u201cgiven the child\u2019s obvious advantages and privilege.\u201d)\n\nTo be fair, the problem of seeming genuine while campaigning is hardly unique to Hillary. Jeb Bush and other GOP establishment candidates haven\u2019t had much luck convincing voters that they\u2019re the real deal, either\u2014particularly during a Summer of Trump where the absurd has become a stand in for the authentic. But for Clinton, it is considered a particularly serious problem given both her biggest official challenger, Bernie Sanders, and her biggest unofficial one, Joe Biden, have had no trouble convincing voters that there\u2019s at least a sliver of person inside the politician.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:23.794+0000"}

For Donald Trump, it\u2019s Latino immigration, and Mexican migrants in particular. For Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, it\u2019s the nuclear deal with Iran; for former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, it\u2019s the Kim Davis affair in Kentucky, where a county official was jailed for refusing to sign marriage licenses for same-sex couples; and for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, it\u2019s crime.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nThat may seem like a strange choice, given broad trends. National rates of violent crime are down to their lowest levels in a generation, with steep drops in gun homicide among all groups. And while violence is still a problem for isolated, low-income black Americans, the overall portrait is good: Twenty years after the crime waves of the 1990s, American cities and metropolitan areas are as safe as they\u2019ve ever been.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLong-term trends can obscure short-term variations, however, and there\u2019s contested evidence that we\u2019re in the middle of a violent crime spike, sparked by a so-called Ferguson effect where less aggressive policing\u2014fueled by \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d protests\u2014encourages criminals. \u201cCities across the nation are seeing a startling rise in murders after years of declines,\u201d reports the New York Times in a story on the rising murder rate in Milwaukee. Critics say this is overblown. Writing for the Marshall Project, Bruce Frederick\u2014a senior research fellow at the Vera Institute of Justice\u2014notes that of the 20 most populous U.S. cities for which there\u2019s public data, only three experienced a \u201cstatistically reliable increase\u201d in homicide rates. For the rest, \u201cthe observed increases could have occurred by chance alone.\u201d If there is a new trend, we need more data. The same goes for the \u201cFerguson effect\u201d; there\u2019s no evidence that less policing has produced more violent crime.\n\nBut humans are built to see patterns in unrelated events, and the crime increase\u2014plus a rash of high-profile shootings aimed at police officers\u2014has brought new partisan attacks on Black Lives Matter, even while 2015 stands as an unusually safe year for police officers, so far. \u201cIn the last six years under President Obama, we\u2019ve seen a rise in anti-police rhetoric,\u201d wrote Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker in an op-ed last week, citing \u201cdemonstrations and chants where people describe police as \u2018pigs\u2019 and call for them to be \u2018fried like bacon.\u2019 \u201d Walker was referring to a small group of protesters in Minnesota who by all accounts are unrepresentative of the larger movement. Still, their actions came in the wake of a brutal attack on a Texas police officer, Sheriff\u2019s Deputy Darren Goforth, who was shot 15 times at a gas station near Houston. And as such, it was fuel for Walker\u2019s charge, as well as for claims from Fox News and other conservative outlets that Black Lives Matter is a \u201chate group.\u201d\n\nThese appeals come at the same time that Republicans need to increase their share of the white vote to win a national majority.\n\nA struggling Christie\u2014who, along with Huckabee and Cruz, lags far behind in the polls\u2014has picked up on this, and run with it. On Tuesday, during an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe, the New Jersey governor slammed Democrats on crime. \u201cIt\u2019s the liberal policies in this city that have led to the lawlessness that\u2019s been encouraged by the president of the United States,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m telling you, people in this country are getting more and more fed up.\u201d Likewise, on Fox News, he blasted President Obama\u2019s rhetoric\u2014or alleged lack thereof\u2014on police killings. \u201cThe president says little or nothing about these issues where police officers are being hunted,\u201d claimed Christie.\n\nThis isn\u2019t true. But that doesn\u2019t mean Christie can\u2019t find traction. With crime and killings in the news, Democrats may be vulnerable to claims of indifference or even encouragement, given their support for Blacks Live Matter. Indeed, this violence threatens the whole project for criminal justice reform.\n\nTo a large degree, the move toward deincarceration and less draconian policing is a product of declining crime. Americans are less afraid of being victimized, which makes them either open to policies that might look \u201csoft\u201d in a more dangerous environment, or they are just apathetic about the issue. But even apathy works; when the public is indifferent, it\u2019s easier to pass unpopular policies or make potentially unpopular commitments. It\u2019s one reason why Hillary Clinton\u2014a cautious politician by any measure\u2014has felt confident enough to openly endorse Black Lives Matter; outside of a dedicated few, no one is paying attention, and no one is trying to use it against her.\n\nChristie and other Republicans are trying to change that. By blaming Obama and Black Lives Matter for an increase in crime or new attacks on police officers, they\u2019re working to conjure the fear and uncertainty of the \u201980s and \u201990s\u2014when violent crime was at an all-time high\u2014and capitalize on them. And it\u2019s worth noting the extent to which these appeals come at the same time that Republicans need to increase their share of the white vote to win a national majority. It\u2019s no accident, perhaps, that Trump has called for giving \u201cpower back to the police, because crime is rampant.\u201d\n\n\u201cCops across this country are feeling the assault,\u201d said Cruz from the trail last week. \u201cThey\u2019re feeling the assault from the president, from the top on down as we see. Whether it\u2019s in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response of senior officials of the president, of the attorney general, is to vilify law enforcement. That is fundamentally wrong, and it is endangering the safety and security of us all.\u201d Cruz isn\u2019t as invested in this message as Christie is\u2014he\u2019s busy rallying against same-sex marriage in Kentucky and the Iran deal in Washington\u2014but he\u2019s part of the same push to make Black Lives Matter a liability for Democrats.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:25.484+0000"}

Now that President Obama has the votes he needs for the Iran deal, Congress\u2014after some scheduled histrionics about the treachery inherent in that diplomatic accord\u2014will give way to the ho-hum issue of funding the federal government for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.\n\nExcept there will be nothing fun or easy for House and Senate leaders in this process. The Planned Parenthood \u201csting\u201d videos that trickled out over the summer prompted congressional conservatives to insist that the federal government no longer provide Title X funding to the family-planning organization. The long truce between pro-choice and pro-life factions, wherein federal grant money that goes to groups like Planned Parenthood is sequestered from money the organization uses to provide abortion services, would appear to be threatened.\n\nThis time there\u2019s a new variable in the mix: A presidential contest is underway, and a handful of senators happen to be participants.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf course, it\u2019s not really in danger. We\u2019ve seen funding games of this nature repeatedly since House Republicans returned to power in 2011. They\u2019ve all played out in more or less the same fashion. Conservatives insist on an ideological demand\u2014repealing Obamacare, a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, defunding Planned Parenthood\u2014that neither Senate Democrats nor the White House consider negotiable. The stalemate goes to the brink, or sometimes several weeks past the brink. Once it\u2019s clear that conservative holdouts are inflicting damage on the Republican brand with no apparent exit strategy, House Speaker John Boehner smokes approximately 47 packs of cigarettes in a single sitting, takes a long sigh, and agrees to move a \u201cclean\u201d funding bill across the finish line with Democratic votes. Democrats celebrate, movement conservatives question the spinal strength of GOP leaders, the sun sets in the west, and the Republic carries on.\n\nThis time there\u2019s a new variable in the mix: A presidential contest is underway, and a handful of senators happen to be participants. That makes Sen. Mitch McConnell\u2019s Senate less of a legislative body than a proving ground for the candidates\u2019 talking points and fundraising appeals.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz was too busy Tuesday rallying outside a Kentucky detention center to spend a full day at the office in Washington. But when he makes it back, he\u2019ll lead the charge against Planned Parenthood. \u201cI intend to lead the fight in the United States Senate to defund Planned Parenthood, even while investigations continue,\u201d Cruz wrote in an opinion piece late last month. \u201cThe time for show votes is over. Funding the federal government does not require funding Planned Parenthood.\u201d Some, like the whole institution that is the Democratic Party, disagree; others, like Republican leaders, might agree but certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth the risk\u2014as in, an inevitable conclusion\u2014of a government shutdown. McConnell has pledged multiple times that there will be no shutdowns under his watch, and one should expect him and Boehner to follow through on that promise.\n\nThe House conservatives who insist on defunding Planned Parenthood find in Cruz their muse, their inspiration, and their conspiratorial dining companion. The aptly nicknamed \u201cSpeaker Cruz\u201d has been egging them on to continue these high-profile losing fights since the day he stepped into freshman orientation. And when Republican leaders \u201ccave,\u201d Cruz hits the fundraising and speaking circuits to denounce the cowardice of the Washington establishment.\n\nThis time, however, Cruz won\u2019t just be channeling that rage to his fundraising emails. He\u2019ll be bringing it to a presidential contest. In doing so he\u2019ll be fanning, and prolonging, the raging sentiment that\u2019s dominated the early sorting stages of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nCruz is an intelligent person. He\u2019s known all summer that this Planned Parenthood fight he\u2019s chosen to wage will end with the federal government continuing to fund Planned Parenthood. And being at the losing end of yet another battle serves as a win for Cruz in the context of his standing in the Republican nomination field. He can, and will, take to the trail to castigate McConnell and the establishment for locking arms with cackling Democrats to promulgate Evil, to allow the senseless murder and mutilation of human beings to continue, and so forth.\n\nIt will work well, to the extent that any Republican candidates who disagree\u2014or even sound like they disagree\u2014risk the ruination of their campaigns. (Except for Donald Trump, who at any given juncture can select option A, B, or C and skyrocket in the polls regardless.)\n\nCruz will have the opportunity to force this question on the field next week at the second Republican presidential debate. Let\u2019s make a wild guess here: Cruz will mention his crusade against Planned Parenthood. If the moderators are worth their salt, they\u2019ll address the field: Raise your hand if you think it\u2019s worth shutting down the government to defund Planned Parenthood. Any candidate (except Trump) who fails to raise his or her hand in this situation will be in extraordinary trouble in the nomination fight; any candidate who does raise his or her hand will have made themselves vulnerable to a potent general election attack ad.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:28.673+0000"}

For two, there's the ongoing controversy over Planned Parenthood's alleged sale of fetal tissue. For three, Ted Cruz.\n\n\n\nWhat do a right-wing Texas senator and an abortion controversy have to do with funding the continued operations of the federal government?\n\nCurrent authorizations for government spending expire on Oct. 1, and to fund the government after that Congress and Obama will have to reach an agreement related to so-called \"sequester\" cuts. Senator Cruz has in recent days circulated a letter declaring his opposition to passing any continuing authorization bill that includes funding for Planned Parenthood. He says he will \"use every and any procedural tool available\" to defund the nonprofit, which receives more than $500 million annually from the federal government to help provide women's health services. (Planned Parenthood is technically not allowed to spend any of that money to perform abortions*.)\n\n\n\nWe've been through all of this before, right?\n\nYes, and with Ted Cruz specifically. In 2013, Cruz led a group of Congressional Republicans that refused to vote to continue operating the government unless the Affordable Care Act was defunded. In late 2014 and early 2015, conservatives threatened to cut off the Department of Homeland Security's funding unless President Obama abandoned plans to enact immigration reform through executive action.\n\n\n\nDid those threats work?\n\nNot really. In 2013 the White House refused to negotiate over the ACA and after a limited 16-day federal shutdown, a number of Republicans caved and Congress voted to continue funding the government. (According to Gallup, the GOP's favorability rating sunk to its lowest level since 1992 during the shutdown.) In 2014 and 2015, shutdown advocates never had enough votes to cut off Homeland Security funding and agency operations were never interrupted.\n\n\n\nSo why would the Republicans try doing this again?\n\nThe party's leaders would rather not. House speaker John Boehner and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell have both said they will not allow another shutdown. But Ted Cruz and the Tea Party faction he often speaks on behalf of don't always do what Boehner and McConnell ask; the shutdown fights are part of what has helped Cruz, who's now running for president, become a prominent national figure. Moreoever, the threat of a shutdown did induce President Obama and Congressional Democrats to make some compromises during budget negotiations back in 2011.

First, the deal is essentially done in Congress. Last week, President Obama secured the final Senate vote needed to sustain his veto of congressional disapproval when Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski announced her support for the agreement.\n\nSecond, if the goal were actually to pick off anyone undecided about the Iran deal, the optics of a Dick Cheney speech at AEI on weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East are just comically bad. Cheney, who made numerous false claims about the threat posed by Iraq\u2019s non-existent weapons of mass destruction, appearing at the Washington think tank that did more than any other to bring about the Iraq debacle is a bit like an unrepentant crook returning to the scene of the crime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCheney previewed the speech with a typically mendacious appearance on Fox News Sunday, in which interviewer Chris Wallace had to correct Cheney\u2019s claim that Iran\u2019s nuke program went from zero to 5,000 centrifuges under Obama. Wallace noted that, in fact, this happened on Bush and Cheney\u2019s watch. In typical fashion, Cheney shrugged it off and moved on to the next claim.\n\nThe policies Cheney advocated in the previous administration did more to empower Iran than anything Obama has ever done.\n\nThis is par for the course for Cheney, and for the worldview he represents. Evidence that runs contrary to his narrative must be dismissed. Acknowledging inconvenient facts is a form of capitulation. Compromising with adversaries on any issue in order to achieve a broader set of goals is indistinguishable from appeasement. And the idea that America, through sheer force of will and, of course, threats of military force, cannot achieve any goal it sets is embracing decline.\n\n\u201cA far better deal is still possible,\u201d Cheney insisted at AEI, and reeled off a list of conditions: \u201cIran must halt its enrichment and reprocessing activities. It must halt its ballistic missile activities. It must provide a full and complete accounting of all its past nuclear activities. It must allow complete go anywhere/anytime access, including at military sites. There should be no sanctions relief until Iran has fulfilled these obligations. If Iran chooses not to do so, they must understand that the United States stands ready to take military action to ensure they do not acquire a nuclear weapon.\u201d The audience applauded.\n\n\u201cThat is how a serious negotiation plays out,\u201d Cheney continued. \u201cThat\u2019s how a self-respecting power, with everything in the balance, asserts its vital interests. Insisting on key non-negotiable points and maintaining a credible threat of military force are the indispensable elements of serious diplomacy over the Iranian nuclear program. That is what the administration should have done all along.\u201d\n\nWhile Cheney is unwilling to examine how this negotiating strategy has fared in the real world, the rest of us should. Back in 2005, Britain, France, and Germany\u2014known as the EU three\u2014were negotiating with Iran over its then-tiny nuclear program and were close to an agreement. But, as former British Foreign Minister Jack Straw subsequently revealed, the Bush administration effectively scuttled the agreement by refusing any compromise on Iranian uranium enrichment. The result? The talks broke down, and Iran\u2019s nuclear program continued to advance at a steady clip, leaving Iran with thousands of centrifuges and a growing stockpile of enriched uranium by the time Obama took office.\n\nThis is just one small example of how the Cheney ideology works, or doesn\u2019t, in real life. For a bigger one, we need only to look at the Iraq war itself, which vastly expanded Iran\u2019s regional power and influence by removing the biggest check on its power, the Saddam Hussein regime, and installing in its place an Iraqi government largely made up of Iran\u2019s clients. In other words, the policies Cheney advocated in the previous administration did more to empower Iran than anything Obama has ever done. This bears repeating constantly, if only because the war\u2019s advocates continue to refuse to acknowledge it.\n\nThe unwillingness of the war\u2019s supporters to recognize that U.S. military intervention in Iraq produced any bad consequences is matched by their obsessive tendency to see everything in the region as a consequence of the Obama administration\u2019s lack of military intervention. And this gets at what was clearly one of the key goals of Cheney\u2019s speech: laying the groundwork for blaming every bad thing that happens for the next 20 years on the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran and retaking control of a national security narrative that the Iraq war seriously damaged.*\n\n\n\nWe should also recognize that the Iran nuke deal would probably not have been possible without the Iraq war, which generated considerable American public opposition to large-scale military interventions and greater openness to diplomatic solutions, enabled the rise of a first-term senator from Illinois who had the foresight to oppose the war when it was unpopular to do so, and activated large numbers of Americans to join grassroots organizations like MoveOn and others in opposition to the war. Indeed, one of the most important stories of the congressional fight over the Iran deal has been that a progressive movement that really found its legs during the Iraq debacle found its strength to prevent the next one.\n\nIn this sense, the Iran deal should be seen as one of the very few benefits of the Iraq war. Cheney probably deserves thanks for that.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:24:47.111+0000"}

{"entityId": 59, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "To fully realize this ideal, however, it was vitally important that Anglo-Saxon Americans not assert themselves in the same way as the members of other ethnic groups. Why? Because if Anglo-Saxon Americans were to celebrate their identity as a people with longstanding ties to their American homeland, it would implicitly discount the American-ness of those from minority ethnic backgrounds. For Bourne, and for those who\u2019ve advocated for his brand of cultural pluralism since, it is the obligation of Anglo-Saxon Americans, and other white Americans with no strong ties to a non-American homeland, to be post-ethnic cosmopolitans. But what if being a post-ethnic cosmopolitan is not actually that satisfying?\n\nIn a 1916 essay in the Atlantic, Randolph Bourne, at the time one of America\u2019s leading left-wing intellectuals, attacked the melting-pot ideal, in which immigrants to the United States and their descendants were expected to assimilate into a common culture. He saw instead America evolving into \u201ca cosmopolitan federation of national colonies, of foreign cultures, from whom the sting of devastating competition has been removed.\u201d Instead of forging a common American identity, the country he envisioned would be one where members of minority ethnic groups preserved their cultural separateness.\n\nWhy does it matter that in the near future, non-Hispanic whites will become a minority in one state after another? The most obvious reason is that non-Hispanic whites might lose their sense of security. They will be outnumbered and outvoted. If they remain wealthier than average, as seems likely, they might fear that majority-minority constituencies will vote to redistribute their wealth. Over time, they might resent seeing their cultural symbols give way to those of minority communities\u2014which is to say the cultural symbols of other minority communities.\n\nNevertheless, I believe that white identity politics is indeed going to become a more potent force in the years to come, for the simple reason that non-Hispanic whites are increasingly aware of the fact that they are destined to become a minority of all Americans. According to current projections, that day will come in 2044. Non-Hispanic whites will become a minority of eligible voters a few years later, in 2052. According to States of Change, a report by Ruy Teixeira, William H. Frey, and Robert Griffin, California and Texas are set to join Hawaii and New Mexico in having majority-minority electorates in the next few years, and several other states will follow in the 2030s.\n\nDoes Donald Trump represent the ascendancy of white nationalism on the American right? I\u2019m skeptical, for a number of reasons. While anti-immigration rhetoric is certainly a big part of Trump\u2019s appeal, it is also true that he fares particularly well among the minority of Republican voters who identify themselves as moderate or liberal. As a general rule, moderate and liberal Republicans are more favorably inclined toward amnesty and affirmative action than their conservative counterparts. Moreover, as Jason Willick of the American Interest has observed , the leading second-choice candidates are Ben Carson, the black neurosurgeon, and Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, both of whom are senators of Cuban descent, the latter of whom played a leading role in crafting immigration reform legislation. Granted, it could still be true that Trump is benefiting from white racial resentment. It\u2019s just not clear to me that Trump is anything more than Herman Cain with an extra billion or so dollars in the bank and over a decade\u2019s worth of experience as host of one of network television\u2019s most popular reality shows.\n\nFear of \u201cwhite nationalism\u201d is very much in vogue. To Thomas Edsall, writing in the New York Times, the rise of Donald Trump is a predictable consequence of the fact that the Republican Party is \u201cthe home of an often angry and resentful white constituency,\u201d which fears that discrimination against whites is a growing problem. Evan Osnos of the New Yorker, in a similar vein, seeks to explain the Trump phenomenon by viewing it through the lens of radical white nationalists, who warn that white Americans face cultural genocide as their numerical majority shrinks. Ben Domenech, publisher of the Federalist, argues that Republicans face a choice: They can build their coalition around a more inclusive libertarian vision, the path that he prefers, or they can follow Trump and redefine themselves as the defenders of white interests in a bitterly divided multiracial society.\n\nIn his highly inventive 2004 book The Rise and Fall of Anglo-America, the sociologist Eric Kaufmann calls this bargain \u201casymmetrical multiculturalism.\u201d Under asymmetrical multiculturalism, minority ethnic groups are encouraged to assert their group identities and to defend their group interests while the majority ethnic group is strongly discouraged from doing the same. Overt expressions of Jewish, Mexican, Laotian, or Bengali pride are very welcome. Overt expressions of WASP pride, however, are not. Kauffman maintains that because WASPs, and to a lesser extent other whites, are denied the option of celebrating their ethnic heritage, they instead champion essentially ideological ideas, like individualism or a vague, ill-defined belief in \u201cAmerican exceptionalism\u201d that is bereft of any real cultural content.\n\nIt should go without saying that white Americans have been quite effective at advancing their interests, even without overt expressions of ethnic pride. You could cynically suggest that it is all well and good for Bengalis to have their Bengali pride as long as whites have all their power. The majority does not need to assert itself, as members of the majority can be serenely confident that their interests will always be served. The trouble is that this serenity is much harder to maintain as majority-group status slips away.\n\nSo what form might white identity politics take as whites become a minority group? We don\u2019t have much experience with this dynamic at a national level, yet there are cities and other communities where whites are already conscious of themselves as a minority group. By 2020, Americans under the age of 18 will be majority-minority, and the attitudes of these young whites will tell us a great deal about the future. For now, we can imagine a number of different possibilities.\n\nIn its most extreme manifestation, white identity politics could take the form of outright racial separatism. For example, Osnos interviewed radical white-nationalist thinkers who hope to establish a sovereign ethno-state exclusively for people of European origin. These thinkers are marginal for now. But radical white nationalists are betting on the possibility that as whites become a minority, ethnic conflict will intensify and more whites will wish to extricate themselves from diverse environments. (To some extent, this already happens: As white Americans age and form families, it is not at all uncommon for them to leave diverse cities for less diverse suburbs or indeed less diverse regions.) You can also imagine a far milder form of white identity politics, in which whites accept ethnic diversity yet insist that they secure a fair share of resources and respect as members of a cohesive ethnic bloc of their own.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:25:42.913+0000"}

Kim Davis, the county clerk who refused to issue licenses because of her anti-gay beliefs, is in jail, where she will remain until she agrees to issue licenses or resigns. Her defiance delayed marriages in her county by roughly two months. Those months were difficult from the couples who were humiliated and stigmatized by her discrimination. But they were an immense victory for the broader cause of gay rights\u2014in particular, the battle between nondiscrimination and \u201creligious liberty.\u201d\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nEver since nationwide marriage equality began to seem inevitable, cultural conservatives have sought to use hazy claims of \u201creligious liberty\u201d to fight back against LGBT rights. Bakers in Colorado and Oregon who denied service to same-sex couples\u2014and faced fines for their discrimination\u2014may not have had any real legal argument. But they were appealing figures whose cases pointed toward a concrete goal of conservatives: granting businesses a special right to turn away gay couples.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nKim Davis also presents no real legal argument: She claims she\u2019s acting \u201cunder God\u2019s authority,\u201d while her extremist attorneys have filed rambling, impudent briefs that attack the Supreme Court\u2019s decision instead of working around it. But unlike the cake warriors, Davis isn\u2019t advancing any concrete conservative goal. Anti-gay activists certainly want to protect anti-gay clerks from having to issue licenses to gay couples. But the right generally favors a fix like North Carolina\u2019s recently enacted law, which lets religious clerks exempt themselves from granting licenses\u2014but ensures that at least one clerk will always be willing to serve. (Davis, in contrast, barred her staff from processing licenses because her name would appear on them.)\n\nDavis wasn\u2019t patient enough to await a legislative solution\u2014or gracious enough to simply resign from the job that she was clearly no longer capable of doing. Instead, she brazenly broke the law and defied a court order that the Supreme Court of the United States itself declined to stay. This flagrant law-breaking alienated Davis\u2019 would-be allies in the press, from the American Conservative\u2019s dyspeptically brilliant Rod Dreher, to the National Review\u2019s gloriously unhinged Charles C.W. Cooke and Kevin D. Williamson. These men have spent years cheering on the Hobby Lobby strategy of respectful, law-based change\u2014and now Davis is blowing all that up. Religious exemption enthusiasts and marriage equality advocates don\u2019t share many passions, but respect for Supreme Court precedent\u2014and, underlying that, the rule of law\u2014is usually one of them.\n\nWhat I doubt Dreher et al. have considered, though, is the extent of the damage Davis has done to the \u201creligious liberty\u201d movement. The crusade for marriage license exemptions is already in danger, as pretty much everybody will associate it, toxically, with Davis. But I suspect the destruction goes deeper than that. Davis\u2019 demands don\u2019t really differ all that much from those of, say, Melissa Klein, the anti-gay Oregon baker. Both want a special right to ignore a neutral, generally applicable law. Both cite their religious beliefs to justify receiving an exemption. And both have seriously degraded gay couples through their discriminatory practices.\n\nThere are, of course, distinctions here\u2014namely that Davis is a government official, while Klein is a private business owner. But is that really an important difference? Klein\u2019s defenders, after all, said gay couples in Oregon should just go to another bakery. Under that logic, why shouldn\u2019t gay couples in Rowan County just go to another courthouse? Davis wasn\u2019t really preventing same-sex couples from getting married; she was only making them drive a few miles to obtain a license when they wanted to get one at home. Conservatives laugh off the dignitary harm gay couples experience when denied service at a bakery. Why should they suddenly care when couples are denied service at a courthouse?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:25:46.016+0000"}

Two decades later, the massive bombing campaign of Operation Rolling Thunder and the introduction of ground troops in Vietnam ushered in an era of napalm-fueled destruction, Agent Orange defoliation, and brutal \u201csearch-and-destroy\u201d missions. The prolonged war cost tens of thousands of American lives and displaced, maimed, and killed millions of Vietnamese.\n\nThe use of the atomic bomb and the escalation of the war in Vietnam represent two of the most controversial episodes in the history of American warfare in the 20th century. Yet we rarely think of them as connected. We should. The terror unleashed at the dawn of the atomic era established the high stakes of the Cold War and pushed American policymakers to draft the infamous ever-escalating yet non-nuclear blueprint for war in Vietnam. The bombings in Japan and the conflict in Vietnam also share a surprising set of common players: American scientists. Twenty years after their handiwork wrought destruction in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Manhattan Project veterans found themselves ensconced in key government and military advisory positions just as the war in Vietnam reached lethal new heights. Perhaps no other group of Americans offers as poignant a portrait of the tortured path from Hiroshima to Hanoi as these men do. Twice in their lifetimes, these elite scientists willingly contributed their expertise to devastating projects whose outcomes they couldn\u2019t control and would come to regret.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe physicists who joined the Manhattan Project in the early days of World War II were largely patriotic men who worried that Nazi scientists were racing to build an atomic bomb. They saw their work as intellectually exciting, but also necessary and just. As it became increasingly clear that the Germans had failed in their efforts, however, a handful of Manhattan Project participants began to worry about how the bomb might actually be used. In July 1945, concerned researchers at the University of Chicago\u2019s \u201cMet Lab,\u201d home of the first nuclear chain reaction, sent a petition to President Harry Truman, urging him to consider the \u201cmoral responsibilities\u201d involved in any decision to use the atomic bomb against Japan. The physicist Leo Szilard, who in 1939 had joined Albert Einstein in calling for what would become the Manhattan Project, now begged the president to avoid a direct atomic attack and instead opt for a demonstration of the bomb\u2019s destructive power on an uninhabited island. His entreaties fell on deaf ears.\n\nThe first reports from Hiroshima and Nagasaki devastated these physicists and forced the entire cohort of Manhattan Project scientists to confront the terrifying implications of their work. Robert Wilson, a Los Alamos veteran, later recalled his sickening realization of the gap between sterile scientific calculations and the terrifying reality of atomic destruction. \u201cIt was one thing to have a scientific expectation about the damage to be caused by a nuclear bomb, and we had learned that,\u201d he observed. \u201cBut it was another thing, just after the bombing attack, to have the actual horror described to us in more and more gruesome details. \u2026 For me the experience was an unforeseen, powerful, revelation. It was an epiphany that has changed my life.\u201d Decades later, the agonized Wilson told a documentary filmmaker of his deep remorse at not leaving the project after the German surrender.\n\nPhoto courtesy National Archives\n\nNot every Manhattan Project scientist had as visceral a reaction as Wilson, but in the aftermath of the bombings, many felt burdened with a powerful sense of moral obligation: Because physicists had invented the bomb, physicists must now work to prevent its further use. This weight even hung over scientists who had never set foot in the Met Lab or Los Alamos. From the most elite universities and from cutting-edge national laboratories, scientists joined Manhattan Project veterans such as Hans Bethe and I.I. Rabi to create the Federation of American Scientists and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, organizations devoted to arms control and disarmament. They raised awareness about the risks of radioactive fallout from nuclear tests. And when the Soviet launch of the satellite Sputnik in 1957 prompted a renewed attention to American science, this cohort took on advisory roles in the White House and the Pentagon. Bethe, Rabi, and others flooded into newly created positions on the President\u2019s Science Advisory Committee, at the Advanced Research Projects Agency, and in the Institute for Defense Analyses. With access to top decision-makers and the president himself, it seemed a golden opportunity to promote arms control from within and without government.\n\nUnfortunately, the 1950s proved an inauspicious decade to achieve this goal. Although President Dwight Eisenhower respected his science advisers and took their advice seriously, his national security program rested on the deterring power of a massive nuclear buildup. Science advisers dutifully offered hard-nosed appraisals of existing weapons systems, but their simultaneous quest to secure a nuclear test ban foundered as tensions with the Soviet Union escalated. Painstaking research into the technology needed to enforce a test ban meant little without the political will of Eisenhower and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev.\n\nWith the election of John F. Kennedy in 1960, however, arms control scientists found a powerful ally. Kennedy had touted the infamous \u201cmissile gap\u201d on the campaign trail, but once in office he listened carefully to his science adviser, Jerome Wiesner, and his secretary of defense, Robert McNamara. They counseled him away from Eisenhower\u2019s hawkish nuclear policy. McNamara favored a security strategy rooted in \u201cgradual escalation\u201d and \u201cflexible response\u201d rather than nuclear deterrence alone. Wiesner, an engineer who had worked on both radar and the atomic bomb during the war, embraced the new focus on limited war and frantically pressed Kennedy to endorse a nuclear test ban. The effort culminated in the compromise 1963 Limited Test Ban Treaty, which prohibited atmospheric nuclear testing, the major source of radioactive fallout.\n\nAs one critic put it, government scientists proved that it was possible to be \u201ca moderate, well meaning, decent war criminal.\u201d\n\nBut even as Kennedy\u2019s science advisers celebrated their arms control success, their docket of assignments was slowly changing. As early as the 1960 presidential campaign, Wiesner had encouraged Kennedy to promote research into non-nuclear weapons \u201cspecialized \u2026 for the different areas where we might have to fight.\u201d The cohort of presidential science advisers agreed, complaining that military leaders during the 1950s had developed \u201cthe big weapons systems required for general war to the neglect of the specialized weapons and systems needed to deal with limited war.\u201d Top Pentagon leaders shared this critique, and from the earliest days of the Kennedy administration, money poured in to limited war research and development. But the shared interest in non-nuclear conflict was not simply a byproduct of scientists\u2019 hopes for arms control; it was a road map to massive destruction in southeast Asia.\n\nScientists, of course, were not the architects of the Vietnam War. Postwar commitments to France and Japan had fueled American concerns in the region, and by the time Kennedy took office, a South Vietnamese insurgency, in collaboration with communists to the north, was mobilizing against the deeply unpopular U.S.-backed regime of Ngo Dinh Diem. To protect the shaky South Vietnamese government, Kennedy expanded the American presence on the ground, deploying the Green Berets, who were prepared for jungle counterinsurgency.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:25:59.174+0000"}

The onetime GOP front-runner didn't think Donald Trump was worth his time. By simply being the adult in the race, he hoped, voters would stick with him and turn away from Trump. Or, at the very least, voters would ignore Trump\u2019s trolling of Bush. But the decent opinions of mankind did not kick in. Bush's poll numbers dropped, while Trump\u2019s rose. Now Bush is confronting Trump head-on. \u201cDonald Trump is trying to insult his way to the presidency,\u201d Bush said Thursday. Bush is also picking up the frequency of his assaults, taking on Trump in ads, with an online quiz about his liberal past, on Instagram, and in television appearances. \u201cTrump is wrong for the party and the country,\u201d said a Bush aide. \u201cWe are going to fight for it. Ducking and hoping he goes away is not a path to success.\u201d\n\nThis is not just a frivolous slap fight. If a Republican who is not Trump becomes president, how he or she dealt with the Teflon Don will be the first major test he or she faced. Campaigns are an imperfect measure of the attributes presidents need in office. They encourage superficiality, and the skills they reward, like fancy speechmaking, aren't as useful when it comes to time to govern. But some campaign moments offer a pretty good test of some of the skills required for the job. Presidents must adapt quickly to surprising, powerful forces that ignore the existing rules. That\u2019s the kind of challenge Trump presents. He also offers an opportunity: A nimble president uses a challenge to focus the public mind and consolidate power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere is not a right or wrong way to take on America\u2019s loudest real estate magnate. But the Trump challenge gives us an opportunity to measure and evaluate. We can assess the candidates and their penchant for action. When GOP candidates talk about President Obama, they deride him for planting himself in his pensive citadel, contemplating and not taking action. He leads from behind. They promise that when it comes to Putin or ISIS or immigration, they will act.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham and former Gov. Rick Perry were the first to respond when presented with the Trump test. They attacked. Graham called him a \u201cjackass,\u201d and Perry said he was \u201ca cancer on conservatism.\u201d It didn\u2019t work out so well for them. As Trump never tires of pointing out, after Graham and Perry attacked him, their poll numbers dropped.\n\nTrump is the Republican presidential field\u2019s first major test to show us how they react to an unexpected challenge.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio has taken the opposite approach. He has largely refused to entertain Trump questions. \u201cIf I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it,\u201d Rubio told Chuck Todd of Meet the Press. He\u2019s going to run his campaign and hope that Trump falls of his own weight. In his case, no action is the best course of action. This is itself a Trump strategy: Stick to your plan and execute your plan; don\u2019t get distracted. Rubio may not like the comparison, but his approach is very much like the approach Obama would probably take. Ben Carson has taken a similar approach, working his way to second in the polls in Iowa and nationally.\n\nGovs. Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal have not attacked Trump directly, but have suggested that governing requires more than \u201csimplistic\u201d solutions\u2014that\u2019s the word Christie used to describe Trump\u2019s immigration plan. Jindal used a question about Trump as an opportunity to talk about his experience actually balancing budgets in Louisiana.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Scott Walker have both chosen to hug Trump. Walker has adopted Trump\u2019s tone somewhat, shifting to portray himself as a foe of the establishment in Washington. Cruz, who already has those credentials, has a strategy that amounts to an elaborate sidling\u2014complimenting and associating himself with the billionaire at key moments. Cruz met with Trump at his office, and is joining Trump at a rally in Washington next week opposing the nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nThe Bush strategy has been slow getting to its feet, unintentionally confirming Trump\u2019s critique that the former Florida governor is \u201clow-energy.\u201d At first, Bush criticized Trump\u2019s tone. That was too vague. Now he\u2019s making more specific claims that Trump appeals to the worst in our nature, is hawking unworkable immigration policies, and is a phony conservative.\n\nBush\u2019s coordinated media campaign against Trump shares some similarities with his brother\u2019s successful effort to repel Sen. John McCain in 2000. George W. Bush also thought his upstart rival would fade away. When he didn\u2019t, his counterattack revolved around questioning whether McCain was anything more than talk. George Bush called himself a \u201cReformer with Results.\u201d Jeb is now touting his \u201crecord of reform and results.\u201d George Bush emphasized that McCain behaved like a Washington insider. Jeb recently said, \u201cIt\u2019s almost as though Donald Trump is acting like a Washington politician.\u201d\n\nAfter Bush vanquished McCain, he thanked him for \u201cputting me through my paces,\u201d recognizing that through competition a candidate improves. That\u2019s why the truly nimble and talented candidate can use Trump as a foil\u2014taking advantage of the churn, chaos, and attention he creates to promote his or her own vision. Or more important, offering his or her own vision to the voters Trump has excited. That isn\u2019t a necessity to defeat Trump\u2014perhaps getting reporters to cover Trump\u2019s thin answers to questioning by Hugh Hewitt is enough to defeat him\u2014but it is an opportunity to show voters something more, including that a candidate can seize opportunities that look like burdens.\n\nBush, for example, could use Trump as a foil to make a loud and proud case for the optimistic, inclusive brand of Republicanism that he says he\u2019s running on. He says that he wants to be joyful and optimistic, but never really shows it. Responding to Trump's claim that he is \u201clow-energy\u201d with a recitation of all the campaign stops he\u2019s hit isn\u2019t the same as actually demonstrating buoyancy in his response.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:26:09.764+0000"}

His next closest competitor, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, takes 18 percent. By contrast, the most mainstream and viable candidates\u2014Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio, and Govs. Scott Walker, John Kasich, and Chris Christie\u2014take 8 percent, 5 percent, 3 percent, 2 percent, and 2 percent respectively, for a combined total of 20 percent support among the five of them.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nIn other words, the age of Trump is here, it shows no sign of retreat, and Republican leaders are nervous. If Trump becomes the nominee\u2014still unlikely, for the same reasons it\u2019s difficult for Sen. Bernie Sanders to pull a win in the Democratic primary\u2014he\u2019d be an easy target for Democrats, who could blast him for everything from inexperience and temperament, to his nativist rhetoric and unsubtle racism. But a Trump nomination is so unlikely that it\u2019s not the actual nightmare for the Republican Party. The nightmare is a third-party run, where Trump gets himself on the ballot in all 50 states, and siphons white voters from a GOP that needs white turnout to win national elections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat nightmare is why, on Wednesday, the Republican National Committee privately circulated a \u201cloyalty pledge\u201d to the party\u2019s presidential candidates. \u201cI [name] affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for president of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,\u201d reads the pledge. \u201cI further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.\u201d The obvious hope was that Trump would agree, rule out an independent run, and let Republican leaders breathe easy (or at least, more easily).\n\nOn Thursday, Trump obliged. He signed the pledge and held a press conference, where he made a verbal commitment to the Republican Party. \u201cI see no circumstances under which I\u2019d tear up that pledge,\u201d he said, adding later that he\u2019s been \u201ctreated well\u201d by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and the RNC. He\u2019ll commit to conservative principles, and if he loses, he loses.\n\nWhether Reince Priebus knows it or not, he\u2019s been played, and it\u2019s going to hurt.\n\nOn the surface, this is an important victory for Republican leaders. But look carefully, and it\u2019s somewhere between a disaster and a catastrophe. Trump hasn\u2019t just bound himself to the RNC, the RNC has bound itself to Trump and put pressure on other candidates to do the same. Let\u2019s say Rubio wins the primary and becomes the Republican nominee. Thanks to the pledge, he\u2019s linked to Trump, and Democrats can run wild with guilt-by-association. By the end of the campaign, Trump might be the face of the Rubio campaign, as much as the Florida senator himself.\n\nThat\u2019s the disaster. The catastrophe is that there\u2019s nothing to hold Trump to the pledge. As soon as it becomes inconvenient, he can break it. And because he\u2019s untethered from the institutions of the Republican Party, Trump has nothing to lose from breaking the pledge. Indeed, anything he gains from signing\u2014the imprimatur of the GOP and commitments from other candidates\u2014is almost irrelevant to his appeal as the \u201coutsider\u201d who understands the world of the \u201cinsiders.\u201d The only thing that ties Trump to his word, on this score, is the promise of official \u201crespect.\u201d For a man of Trump\u2019s ego, that\u2019s weak binding.\n\nConsider Ross Perot, whose 1992 run was a challenge to George H.W. Bush, although it didn\u2019t cost him the election. Initially, Perot denied a plan to run. But, on a February episode of Larry King Live, he hedged his refusal. \u201cIf voters in all 50 states put me on the ballot\u2014not 48 or 49 states, but all 50\u2014I will agree to run,\u201d he said. Voters came out, and he ran. But by the summer, his campaign was pockmarked by controversy and on the decline. Appearing with Larry King again, he announced his political departure. \u201cI have not gone away,\u201d Perot told King. \u201cBut I have concluded that I should not be the candidate.\u201d This lasted for a few short months, at which point, Perot jumped into the race for good. \u201cThe volunteers in all 50 states have asked me to run as a candidate for President of the United States,\u201d Perot said in an October speech. \u201cJim Stockdale, our vice-presidential candidate, and I are honored to accept their request.\u201d\n\nNo, Perot didn\u2019t sign a pledge or run in either primary. But that doesn\u2019t make him a different case; the point is that Perot made a promise, and broke it. And why wouldn\u2019t he? He had nothing to lose. On the same score, it\u2019s not hard to imagine a world where Trump loses the primary, but \u201cthe voters\u201d still want him to run. What stops Trump from citing imagined \u201cdisrespect\u201d and starting a third-party campaign? Nothing. The Republican Party can\u2019t stop him, and it can\u2019t sanction him.

The text is brief but comprehensive. \u201cI, [name], affirm that if I do not win the 2016 Republican nomination for President of the United States I will endorse the 2016 Republican presidential nominee regardless of who it is,\u201d it reads. \u201cI further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEach of the candidates will likely sign this piece of paper and submit it to the boss. There are severe consequences for any candidate who breaches this agreement: Priebus will \u2026 give that candidate a look of disappointment, expressing displeasure. Perhaps Priebus will even issue a statement expressing his displeasure.\n\nIn other words, there are no hard consequences for breaking this pledge. A candidate runs the risk of being labeled A Guy Who Breaks Pledges. But come now; if Trump were to run as an independent, he would simply come out and say that it was Priebus, the crooked establishment Republican Beltway insider fat cat, who reneged on the terms of the pledge by calling him a name, real or imagined. \u201cI have no intention of changing my mind,\u201d Trump said at his Thursday afternoon press conference in Trump Tower, following Priebus\u2019 departure. And sure, that\u2019s a statement of fact: Who has ever intended to change his mind?\n\nThe Republican Party has now committed itself to supporting an agenda that goes against decades of its own dogma.\n\nThis is not the pledge that matters. Instead it was the Republican parties of certain states, most notably South Carolina, that brought Trump to a decision point. Palmetto State GOP leaders made inclusion on its primary ballot conditional on the signing of a loyalty pledge by Sept. 30. Trump was compelled to sign that and other pledges to get on the ballots. Priebus is just formalizing the states\u2019 dirty work, like any good small-government federalist would. And as soon as primary season ends, Trump could break most of the state pledges, too.\n\nAnd yet, why would he? The logic behind a Trump independent run doesn\u2019t hold up on the most basic level. If he remains atop the polls as time goes on\u2014and his ceiling for support keeps growing\u2014he will win the Republican nomination. If he collapses, then he collapses, and he no longer has the political support to make an independent presidential bid a worthwhile expenditure of personal resources.\n\nStill, there\u2019s too much on the line for Priebus and fellow custodians of the GOP presidential nomination process to call Trump\u2019s bluff. If Trump were to launch an independent bid, even one that attracted few percentage points, that would likely be the ballgame for the Republican Party. This dynamic left Priebus and state party leaders in a desperate position to do whatever was necessary to get Trump to sign a loyalty pledge and then pray that hopefully, hopefully it means enough to the real estate magnate that he feels compelled to honor his word.\n\nPriebus\u2019 visit to Trump Tower further cements this reality television star\u2019s transformation into a \u201creal\u201d presidential candidate who cannot be ignored or laughed off as the cycle deepens. And though Trump has signed this piece of paper saying he will and won\u2019t do certain things next year, he has not signed any piece of paper requiring him to disavow the unorthodox nationalist, protectionist, tax increase\u2013supporting agenda with which he\u2019s carved his sizable lane. The Republican Party, however, has now committed itself to supporting this agenda, which goes against decades of its own dogma, if Trump is able to pull off the nomination. Most of today\u2019s news has been framed as Trump signs pledge to support eventual nominee. Another way to look at it is Establishment Republican candidates pledge to support Donald Trump. Trump has not pledged to incorporate into his candidacy any of the cheerier tones or traditional Republican policies that the GOP establishment would like to see from him. The Republican Party, though, has agreed to incorporate Trump.\n\nIn bringing his politics into the fold, the GOP has also handed Trump a shield just when he might need it. Jeb Bush\u2019s campaign has begun the offensive against Trump\u2019s political past, putting together a montage of Trump over the years stating that he\u2019s pro-choice, a friend and admirer of Hillary Clinton\u2019s, and an advocate for a single-payer health care system\u2014all delivered with the same phony conviction that he wields now to emphasize the opposite. Now, when Bush or whoever else uses these attacks against Trump on the trail or at the next debate, Trump can fire right back: Didn\u2019t you see Reince Priebus come to my office? Didn\u2019t you see me just pledge my support to the Republican nominee? If I were a liberal, why would I do that?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:26:41.703+0000"}

It\u2019s that in the two most critical states\u2014Iowa and New Hampshire\u2014he\u2019s either on the rise, or winning outright. The Des Moines Register and its well-regarded pollster puts Sanders at 30 percent of the vote among Iowa Democrats. Clinton is at 37 percent. Other polls show a less even race\u2014with Clinton well ahead\u2014but the trend is clear: Sanders is improving and Clinton is fading. To that point, he has his best support among first-time caucus-goers, independents, and voters under 45\u2014the same groups that brought Barack Obama to a surprise win in 2008.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe same is true in New Hampshire, where Sanders is ahead, full stop. He leads by an average of 43.6 percent to Clinton\u2019s 39.8 percent, a major shift from the beginning of the summer, when Clinton held a large lead over her chief competitor. Some of this is homefield advantage, but we shouldn\u2019t underestimate the degree to which Clinton is weaker than she was, and Sanders is more popular than we (and possibly even he) imagined.\n\nA viable candidate isn\u2019t the same as a possible nominee.\n\nIt helps too that Sanders holds his own in head-to-head polls with Republicans. In a hypothetical match-up from the latest Quinnipiac survey, Sanders beats Jeb Bush, 43 percent to 39 percent; Donald Trump, 44 percent to 41 percent; and comes just behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, 40 percent to 41 percent. The self-described \u201csocialist\u201d\u2014a cranky, left-wing fixture in American politics\u2014is a viable presidential candidate.\n\nBut a viable candidate isn\u2019t the same as a possible nominee. And while the raw material is there, it would take skill, discipline, and incredible good fortune for Sanders to bridge the gap from phenomenon to the Democratic Party\u2019s choice for the White House.\n\nFirst, he would have to get used to scrutiny. Blacks Lives Matter aside, Sanders hasn\u2019t been criticized like a serious presidential candidate. Clinton has stayed away\u2014perhaps worried of alienating his supporters\u2014and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has focused his fire on the GOP and the Democratic National Committee. If Sanders is a real contender, however, that will change. Clinton and her team\u2014to say nothing of the press, and of Republicans\u2014will dive into his past, and exploit any weakness he has. Sanders might survive the process, but you shouldn\u2019t count on it. Obama survived the furor over Jeremiah Wright, but it was close; if not for his rhetorical gifts, the then-candidate might have crashed his campaign on the rocks of controversy.\n\nIf Sanders can get past the scrutiny, he\u2019ll have to grow his appeal. Most Democrats aren\u2019t liberals and many Democrats aren\u2019t white, but so far, Sanders is the candidate of white liberals and just a handful of blacks and Latinos. Without a large share from either group, Sanders can\u2019t compete in vital states like South Carolina and Nevada, where they dominate voting. But going beyond his base is more difficult than it looks. For as much as black Americans might like his policy positions\u2014which fit their enthusiasm for a stronger safety net\u2014they\u2019re also strategic voters, not ideological stalwarts. Electability is key, and as a consequence, they tend to back the establishment choice: Al Gore over Bill Bradley; John Kerry over John Edwards. On occasion, blacks will back a factional candidate, like Jesse Jackson in 1984 and 1988. But Jackson had the reverse problem\u2014he couldn\u2019t win enough whites.\n\nIn other words, to win as a challenger in the Democratic Party, you have to bridge the gap between two different parts of the party. And this is hard. So hard, in fact, that it\u2019s only been done twice in the modern era: Jimmy Carter in 1976, and Obama in 2008, who won over black voters with his surprise win in the Iowa caucuses. If Sanders wants to repeat the feat, he\u2019ll have to do two things simultaneously: Beef up his operation in Iowa and New Hampshire, and invest in South Carolina with time and resources. He needs to cultivate visible allies in the black political community and build a dedicated presence with black civic institutions. He may not win the black vote, but with effort, he can deny Clinton the advantage of unified black support.\n\nThis is vital, but it\u2019s still not enough. Even if he wins the early contests and builds momentum for the next round, he\u2019ll have to survive Super Tuesday, which rewards organization, strategy, and institutional support more than popularity or enthusiasm. Obama had all of this\u2014plus an inept effort from the Clinton campaign\u2014and finished with a tie.\n\nIf Sanders can raise the money and hire the staff to build a credible national campaign for Super Tuesday, then he\u2019ll still face a seasoned Clinton with a fresh memory of her past mistakes. He\u2019ll have to match Obama\u2019s flawless performance against an opponent who knows the moves, and is ready to meet them. And in that, she\u2019ll be backed by the bulk of the Democratic Party. Not only does Clinton have the most major endorsements of anyone in the race, by far, but Sanders can\u2019t catch up; even with every remaining governor, senator, and representative, Sanders would still be behind in the all-important endorsement primary.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that Sanders is a viable presidential candidate, but his barriers to winning are almost insurmountable. And not all of that is Clinton. If Clinton were to leave the race\u2014imagine an indictment for purposefully sharing classified information over unsecured email\u2014Sanders wouldn\u2019t benefit. He\u2019s just too out of the mainstream, and the Democratic Party\u2014seeking a consensus candidate\u2014would just find someone else from the center of the coalition, whether that\u2019s Martin O\u2019Malley or Vice President Joe Biden or a figure who isn\u2019t even on the radar.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:26:48.826+0000"}

I further pledge that I will not seek to run as an independent or write-in candidate nor will I seek or accept the nomination for president of any other party.\n\nThe pledge was specifically aimed at Trump, who before Thursday had refused to rule out a third-party run since he said threatening one gave him so much \u201cleverage\u201d in the race.\n\nAt Thursday\u2019s press conference, the current GOP front-runner explained that he was willing to finally give that up since the RNC had proved to him that it would treat him fairly. \u201cI just wanted fairness from the Republican Party,\u201d he said.

During the roughly 30-minute press conference, he managed to throw punches at half a dozen of his GOP rivals, including Rand Paul, Rick Perry, Lindsey Graham, and his favorite target, Jeb Bush.\n\nGiven the outsider image Trump has taken great pains to craft, the decision to sign the RNC-authored pledge is somewhat surprising. Still, it does come with a few traditional political benefits: It removes the possibility that some state GOP officials would try to keep him off their primary ballots, as several had suggested. It also will stop Trump from facing the same type of grilling at the upcoming CNN debate about a possible third-party run that he received from Fox News at the last one.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:26:49.764+0000"}
{"entityId": 75, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Reuters\n\nDonald Trump may be a bankruptcy court recidivist and serial exaggerator of his net worth, but some recent criticisms of his business skills may have\u2014shockingly\u2014gone overboard. At Vox, Dylan Matthews has a piece titled \"Donald Trump isn't rich because he's a great investor. He's rich because his dad was rich.\" The gist is that in 1974, long before he had turned his family name into a global byword for garishness, the current GOP front-runner inherited a $40 million stake in his father's real estate empire. If he had simply liquidated it and invested the cash in the S&P 500, he would\u2014maybe\u2014be about as rich as he is today. Here's the math:\n\nIf someone were to invest $40 million in a S&P 500 index in August 1974, reinvest all dividends, not cash out and have to pay capital gains, and pay nothing in investment fees, he'd wind up with about $3.4 billion come August 2015, according to Don't Quit Your Day Job's handy S&P calculator. If one factors in dividend taxes and a fee of 0.15 percent\u2014which is triple Vanguard's actual fee for an exchange-traded S&P 500 fund\u2014the total only falls to $2.3 billion.\n\nIt's hard to nail down Trump's precise net worth, but Bloomberg currently puts it at $2.9 billion, while Forbes puts it at $4 billion. So he's worth about as much as he would've been if he had taken $40 million from his dad and thrown it into an index fund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOf all the criticisms you could lob at Trump, this is a weirdly weak one.1 Basically, Trump took a $40 million kernel and, while spending lavishly enough to surround himself with all the gold-plated bathroom fixtures his heart desired, managed to do a 26 percent better job growing his fortune than if he had quietly left it to grow in stocks without selling a single share or spending a single dividend check for 41 years. I'd say that's pretty good. How many actual money managers could brag they'd done the same with their clients' cash?2\n\nOf course, Trump is not strictly an investor. Throughout his career he has been a real estate developer and manager, a builder of golf courses, a casino magnate, a reality TV host, a celebrity who slaps his name on assorted buildings for a fee, a hawker of power ties, and much more. This cuts against the idea that he is glorified trust-fund kid: Rather than sit on his wealth while someone else saw to its care, he decided to jump into a number of highly entertaining, risky, and at time ill-advised business ventures, which have helped turn him into an international celebrity. He took risks with the money he was given, and they seem to have paid off over time, both financially and personally. Meanwhile, Trump runs a company with thousands of employees. Whatever wealth he has created for himself, the total value that his company has created over the years is probably far greater.\n\n\n\nFinally, it's a little strange to criticize someone who isn't a money manager for failing to trounce the stock market's returns. The S&P 500 is not a benchmark index for real estate conglomerates. You could argue Trump has done worse than some his fellow developers, but that's a different issue.\n\n\n\nAnyway, now that I've spent a few hundred words defending Trump's business, I feel the need for a shower. Would the short-fingered vulgarian be fabulously rich today without the start his father handed him? My guess is not. But claiming that his father's money is the only reason he's a billionaire today? That's a little unfair, even to a boor like Trump.\n\n\n\n1Not to get hung up on details, but it's worth noting that the first S&P Index Fund wasn't founded until 1975. Meanwhile, Vanguard exchange traded funds, or ETFs, didn't show up until 2001.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:26:57.217+0000"}

{"entityId": 77, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnother poll, another good day for Donald Trump. The latest Des Moines Register-Bloomberg survey has the brassy billionaire leading the GOP field in Iowa by 5 points over Ben Carson and another 10 points over everyone else. That, though, isn\u2019t why the survey should be giving the Republican establishment heartburn.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe more worrisome news for GOP powerbrokers is not that Trump is leading in the Hawkeye State\u2014that\u2019s been the case for more than a month now\u2014but why and how he is leading. Dig down into the survey\u2019s crosstabs and there\u2019s evidence that runs counter to two of the chief things that Republicans have been consoling themselves with during the Summer of Trump: The first is that despite the billionaire\u2019s unexpected rise to the top of the polls, his appeal is too limited to attract the kind of support he\u2019ll need to stay there once the field narrows. The second is that the Donald\u2019s allure is all about his personality and not about his actual policies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBoth of those fundamentals are likely still generally valid\u2014but the new numbers out of Iowa suggest they might not be as rock solid as Republican powerbrokers would like to believe. Let\u2019s take them in order:\n\nTrump\u2019s ceiling\n\nThe Donald has so far displayed an uncanny ability to ignore the laws of political gravity. He\u2019s dabbled in racism, misogyny, and conservative apostasy this summer, and yet\u2014despite repeated predictions to the contrary\u2014he remains the Republican leader both nationally and in the early-nominating states. Still, the thinking goes, his abysmal favorability numbers and narrow appeal mean that he has a ceiling that will prevent him from ever garnering the type of support he\u2019d need to be competitive in 2016.\n\nThat may still prove true in time but right now Trump\u2019s Iowa ceiling looks a whole lot higher than it once was. In the three months since the last time the Register\u2019s pollsters asked the question, the percentage of likely GOP caucus-goers who said they could \u201cnever\u201d vote for Trump dropped in half from 58 percent\u2014the highest in the field at the time\u2014to 29 percent, a number roughly in the middle of the Republican pack. Likewise, those who said they could see themselves voting for Trump doubled from 34 to 68 percent over that same period. His favorability splits tell a similar story: 61 percent of likely GOP caucus-goers said they had a favorable opinion of him, compared to 35 percent who had an unfavorable one. That\u2019s a near complete reversal from where those numbers stood in May, back when no one thought he\u2019d actually get in the race.\n\nIn short, Trump might not need to increase his slice of the GOP pie to win in Iowa. Mike Huckabee took the 2008 caucus with about a third of the vote, while Rick Santorum needed only a quarter of it to eke out his victory four years later.\n\nPersonality vs. policies\n\nIt\u2019s going on three months since Trump called everyone\u2019s bluff and jumped into the race, but political observers\u2014myself very much included\u2014are still trying to figure out exactly what it is about Trump that is so appealing to his supporters. The working theory is that it\u2019s much more about his personality\u2014the combination of his anti-establishment anger and brash bluster\u2014 than about his specific policy views. That still seems like a safe bet. In the Iowa poll, for example, 57 percent of Republican respondents said that when it comes to policy specifics, they trust their first choice candidate \"to figure it out\" once he\u2019s in office, compared to only 41 percent who wanted to be clear up front where that candidate stood. That\u2019s a good sign for Trump: I\u2019ll figure it out is his unofficial campaign slogan when it comes to policy. (Though the rest of the GOP field could make a similar claim.)\n\nStill, Trump has gotten specific on immigration. And on that topic at least, Iowa Republicans like what they\u2019ve heard. When pollsters asked about Trump\u2019s deport-them-all immigration strategy without mentioning his name, it was remarkably well received. Nearly half of the Republicans polled\u201447 percent\u2014said that \u201crounding up 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally and sending them to their home country\u201d would be a \u201cgood way\u201d to address the nation\u2019s immigration problems, compared to 37 percent who said the opposite. Meanwhile, two-thirds of the GOP respondents said that generally speaking, the issue of illegal immigration was a strength for Trump.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:27:33.060+0000"}

Instants after announcing over the winter that he was \u201cseriously considering the possibility of running for president,\u201d Bush and his team set up the Right to Rise PAC and super PAC to serve as cash receptacles for eager GOP establishment donors. The money rolled in, and by July the super PAC announced that it had met its goal of raising more than $100 million in the first six months of the year. The popular former governor of Florida, who hadn\u2019t run for office since his 2002 re-election bid, was able to take it to the bank based on his family\u2019s success at winning presidential nominations and his ability to flatter the right crowds at events like the Wall Street Journal CEO Council. And indeed, he was able to bypass a thorough vetting of his aptitude for a presidential run en route to this fortune.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhoops.\n\nGOP donors have already ensured that the Bush campaign\u2014even a clumsy, poll-trailing Bush campaign\u2014can go deep into the 2016 primary calendar.\n\nBecause it\u2019s clear right now that \u201ca hazing trial to test skill and stability\u201d was exactly what wealthy establishment Republican donors should have subjected Bush to before opening their checkbooks. It\u2019s not a matter of sunk costs. The very wealthy, by their standards, can still buy politics on the cheap: losing a million bucks on a lemon of a candidate won\u2019t send them to the poor house. But by imbuing the Bush operation with more primary cash than has ever been seen, they have already ensured that the Bush campaign\u2014even a clumsy, poll-trailing Bush campaign\u2014can go deep into the 2016 primary calendar. Unless Bush can really turn his image around, that means that the process of settling on an establishment candidate will play out far longer than the party may prefer\u2014and perhaps even throw the nomination to the dreaded \u201coutsider\u201d candidate of the establishment\u2019s worst nightmares. Go ahead, fellas: Clutch those pearls.\n\nHad Bush undergone the hazing trial from which over-exuberant donors exempted him, red flags would have been flying all over the place. He is gaffe-prone. He struggles to opine coherently on the most obvious question for which he\u2019s had years to prepare. He speaks, in the words of his great foil Donald Trump, in a \u201clow-energy\u201d manner. His last name remains Bush, a problem for both his primary and general elections prospects.\n\nAll of these flaws are reflected in his polling numbers, which aren\u2019t the most important metric to look at this early, as well as his fundamentals. Seemingly each new polling of favorability, a rough way of considering a candidate\u2019s ceiling of support, shows Bush in horrendous shape. A Public Policy Polling national survey of Republican voters released Tuesday pins Bush near the middle of the pack in support (as in, 20 or so points behind Trump), and near the bottom of the pack in net favorability. His 39\u201342 negative favorability rating is among the worst in the field, surpassed in dislike only by candidates such as Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul whose viability was always limited. (Meanwhile Trump, whose unfavorables only a few months ago soared into the 60s or even 70s, now finds himself with a solid 56\u201330 rating.)\n\nYou know who is well liked? Sen. Marco Rubio, the notoriously amnesty-curious junior senator from Florida. While still low in overall support, Rubio\u2019s slow-and-steady, mostly gaffe-free campaign has left him in prime position to surge once various other early flirtations have expired. PPP\u2019s survey finds Rubio\u2019s favorable-unfavorable at 58\u201324, the second best margin behind only Ben Carson, who will face extraordinary scrutiny if his nascent surge lasts much longer. This is only the latest survey in a long string of them that reflects the fond feelings Republican voters have for Rubio, a candidate who\u2019s been through the wringer of conservative furor and lived not just to tell about it, but to thrive.\n\nIt\u2019s almost like Rubio is shaping into a fine presidential candidate, acceptable to conservatives and moderates alike, who could compete gamely in a general election. It\u2019s almost like Rubio \u2026 what\u2019s a way of putting this? ... has undergone a hazing trial to test his skill and stability and passed, with plenty of room to grow after the Summer of Trump and all of the silly, early dabbling that comes with that.\n\nRubio\u2019s problem\u2014and perhaps soon a problem for the GOP establishment and the Republican Party writ large\u2014is that Bush will face no financial pressure to leave the scene. These donors made the mistake of paying the contractor in full before he\u2019d begun the job. In no way can Bush be ruled out as the nominee. But we\u2019re definitely at the point where he cannot simply wait for the other candidates to cancel each other out, McCain-style, and have their support matriculate to him as the only acceptable option. Bush will have to find some way to go from an unpopular politician to a moderately popular politician.\n\nLet\u2019s say that he\u2019s unable to pull off that difficult task. He\u2019d still be well-known and well-liked enough among a modest segment of party to retain 10 or 20 percent support\u2014just enough to prevent Rubio (or the always-discussed, never-realized white knight) from reaching escape velocity. We race past Super Tuesday at the beginning of March and reach the latter end of the calendar when state primary rules switch from proportional to winner-take-all delegate allocation. Jeb and his super PAC still have bushels of money and figure they might as well stick around and hope something changes, because why not? He and Rubio split up the moderates. Trump either doesn\u2019t blow up or retains enough support to take those winner-take-all states on his own, or he does blow up, and a figure like Cruz successfully coalesces the anti-establishment vote.\n\nThese are the problems that GOP establishment donors created by throwing million-dollar checks at Bush before seeing if anyone liked him or he was up to the task on the campaign trail. Thus far he has failed in both regards. But he still has all that loot and, much like his brother once said about the political capital he\u2019d accumulated, he intends to spend it. Perhaps his Bush family WASP instincts will kick in and, like a gentleman, he\u2019ll call it quits early if things aren\u2019t working out, instructing his super PAC from then on to devote its resources to Rubio.

The Washington Post, though, has found one small but significant fact that goes beyond gefilte fish and The Good Wife: Clinton \u201cwrote and sent at least six e-mails using her private server that contained what government officials now say is classified information.\u201d\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nTo be clear: This is not a game changer. The State Department says the information in question was classified only after Clinton left her post. Since the material has been redacted, we don\u2019t know just how sensitive it was\u2014but government officials who have seen some of the un-redacted messages tell the Post that the conversations were, in the paper\u2019s words, \u201cgenerally benign.\u201d The report, then, won\u2019t significantly reshape a controversy that\u2019s been dragging on for months.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nStill, the development is noteworthy given it makes clear that Clinton wasn\u2019t simply a passive recipient of the sensitive information. That doesn\u2019t contradict Team Hillary\u2019s official position, but it does remove the possible defense that, at worst, she had only received sensitive information and unwittingly forwarded it along, as her allies had previously hinted. As a result, the report could force Clinton into a slightly smaller semantic box than she already is in when defending herself on the campaign trail. She can still say that she never knowingly sent sensitive material that was marked \u201cclassified\u201d at the time, but she won\u2019t have the option of saying that she never put that information in an email and hit \u201csend.\u201d\n\nTo date, the State Department has released roughly a quarter of the 30,000-odd work emails that Clinton turned over to the agency late last year at its request. So far, portions of 188 of those messages have been classified prior to their release.\n\nWhile the State Department maintains that it has found no evidence that Clinton sent or received information that was classified at the time, intelligence community watchdogs have disputed that claim. After taking a close look at a small sample of about 40 emails sent to or from Clinton\u2019s personal account, a pair of government inspector generals warned earlier this summer that they\u2019d found what they said were several intelligence secrets, at least two of which they said should have been marked as \u201ctop secret\u201d but weren\u2019t. The information, the investigators said, is classified now and was likewise back when it was sent. According to the Post\u2019s sources, though, \u201cClinton did not write\u201d those emails. These newly discovered messages, however less troubling their contents may be, will be much more difficult for Clinton to deny responsibility for.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:27:53.072+0000"}
{"entityId": 81, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Section 2 provides relief when minority voters have less opportunity than others to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice. It has long been accepted by the courts in so-called vote dilution cases, in which black, Latino, or other minority voters get gerrymandered out of political power by the creative drawing of district lines. In 1986 , the Supreme Court adopted a framework for deciding when Section 2 requires jurisdictions to draw legislative or congressional districts to help minority voters elect candidates of their choice.\n\nBut now Texas has upped the ante, arguing that if Section 2 indeed makes its voter ID law illegal, then Section 2 violates the Constitution. That means the other great statutory protection of minority voting rights would suffer the same fate as the preclearance provision and leave minority voters with few protections from unwarranted new voting hurdles.\n\nSo the federal government and civil rights plaintiffs have used Section 2 as their best remaining protection. They used it to go after Texas for enacting one of the strictest voter ID laws in the nation and North Carolina for passing an omnibus voting rights rollback. Somewhat surprisingly, a panel of the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5 th Circuit recently agreed that Texas\u2019 decision to enact a strict voter ID law, without proof that the law is necessary to prevent voter fraud or promote public confidence, violated Section 2.\n\nDon\u2019t worry, Chief Justice John Roberts assured the American public in that 2013 case, Shelby County v. Holder . Although states with a history of racial discrimination would no longer be subject to federal \u201cpreclearance\u201d of voting changes because preclearance offends the \u201cequal sovereignty\u201d of states such as Texas, there\u2019s always Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. That provision, Roberts explained, is available \u201cin appropriate cases to block voting laws from going into effect. \u2026 Section 2 is permanent, applies nationwide, and is not at issue in this case.\u201d\n\nIn the midst of all of this, the Supreme Court in 2013 struck down a key component of the Voting Rights Act. It had required states and jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to get permission from the federal government before making a voting change by proving that the proposed change would not make it harder for minority voters to vote and to elect their preferred candidates.\n\nThen, following the contested 2000 elections, states started passing new voting rules along partisan lines. As part of these voting wars , conservative states began passing laws making it harder to register and vote, restrictions that seemed to fall most on poor and minority voters.\n\nIn 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, one of the most important pieces of legislation in U.S. history. It contained key protections for minority voters, especially blacks, who had been effectively disenfranchised in the South. The act was a remarkable success, increasing minority voter registration and turnout rates within a few years. In 1982, an important amendment made it much easier for minority voters to elect candidates of their choice.\n\nBut we have much less experience using Section 2 in so-called vote denial cases, in which the claim is that the government enacted a voter ID law, tough voter registration rule, or other voting rule that makes it harder to cast a ballot that will count. In a series of cases beginning in the 1990s, courts rejected Section 2 challenges to felon disenfranchisement, mostly ruling that when Congress passed Section 2, it did not mean to interfere with states\u2019 decisions to disenfranchise felons for as long as the state deemed necessary, even if today\u2019s felon disenfranchisement bans have the greatest impact in black communities.\n\nBut after the Supreme Court killed preclearance, ruling that the formula used to pick which states must get federal approval of voting changes was constitutionally outdated, the U.S. Department of Justice and voting rights lawyers started bringing vote denial suits under Section 2. The courts have split on how to apply it and whether strict voter ID laws and other voting cutbacks violate the section. Last year, a federal district court held Wisconsin\u2019s voter ID law violated Section 2, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit reversed that decision, and the Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The 7th Circuit held that despite evidence that up to 300,000 Wisconsin voters lacked the right kind of voter ID, and despite evidence that minority voters were much more likely than white voters to lack such ID, there could be no Section 2 violation without proof that state racial discrimination caused the disparity. The entire 7th Circuit split 5\u20135 on whether to hear the case, with Judge Richard Posner writing a scathing dissent from the failure to do so.\n\nA federal district court in Texas and the 5th Circuit reached a different conclusion than the 7th Circuit in reviewing the Texas case, finding that when one considered all of the factors courts usually consider in vote dilution cases, Texas\u2019 law violated Section 2. A very large number of Texas voters lack the mandated form of ID and don\u2019t have easy access to get it, and that burden falls heaviest on poor and minority voters.\n\nA key factor in the 5th Circuit\u2019s analysis, in an opinion by George W. Bush appointee Catharina Haynes, was the \u201ctenuousness\u201d of Texas\u2019 explanation for the law: Texas offered no proof that its law really was necessary to fight voter fraud. The 5th Circuit panel ordered the trial court to consider how it might rework the law so that it could be partially enforced but would no longer discriminate against minority voters.\n\nNow Texas has filed a petition asking the entire 5th Circuit (sitting \u201cen banc\u201d) to review the law, and you should expect Texas to go to the Supreme Court if it loses again. Aside from arguing that Section 2 does not bar its voter ID law, the state argues that Section 2 would be unconstitutional if it actually made Texas\u2019 voter ID law illegal. First, piggybacking off the Shelby County decision, Texas argues, such a reading of Section 2 would exceed Congress\u2019 power to enforce the Constitution\u2019s prohibition on race discrimination in voting under the 15th Amendment. Second, Texas argues that if Section 2 is violated simply by showing an election law has a \u201cdisparate impact\u201d on racial minorities, then this would elevate racial considerations over a state\u2019s legitimate policy objectives, like stopping voter fraud.\n\nLet\u2019s not mistake what Texas is doing here. To seem more moderate, it couches its constitutional arguments in the language of \u201cconstitutional avoidance,\u201d not exactly saying that Section 2 is unconstitutional but saying that the courts should read it narrowly because otherwise the law would be unconstitutional. In practical terms, that\u2019s a distinction without a difference. In either case, according to Texas, the result is that Section 2 cannot offer protection for racial minorities in vote denial cases.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:27:57.984+0000"}

Disagreeing with the NAACP about Michael Brown doesn\u2019t make you racist. Disagreeing with the National Organization for Women about late-term abortion doesn\u2019t make you sexist. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that your position on one issue or one arbiter makes you a bigot.\n\nThis pledge, too, is important. To take risks, people need some measure of safety. If you want American mosques to cooperate with the FBI, you\u2019d better make clear that you don\u2019t see Islam as the enemy . And if you don\u2019t want Latinos to freak out about tighter enforcement of immigration laws, you\u2019d better stipulate that you\u2019re not going to mess with the 14 th Amendment .\n\nBasically, Obama\u2019s argument is that the history of anti-Semitism warrants special protections for Jews: a state of their own, plus military superiority. In theory, this is discrimination. In reality, it\u2019s a well-earned hedge against persistent persecution. The same could be said of affirmative action. Dismissing it is historically naive.\n\n2. Don\u2019t whitewash history. In speeches and interviews, Obama has acknowledged \u201c centuries of persecution and pogroms \u201d against Jews, from \u201c Inquisition-era Spain to Tsarist Russia to Hitler\u2019s Germany .\u201d On Friday, he told the Jewish groups that this \u201ctragic history\u201d underlies his commitment to Israel\u2019s \u201cqualitative military edge\u201d over its neighbors. In his interview with Goldberg, Obama defended Zionism this way:\n\nThese acknowledgments are important. If you\u2019re going to argue that a historically oppressed group is misapplying its anxieties to a current question, it\u2019s best to stipulate that the anxieties themselves are well founded.\n\n1. Don\u2019t whitewash prejudice. Last Friday, in a webcast with Jewish organizations , Obama said Israelis have good reason to fear Iran: \u201cWhen you have a regime that denies the Holocaust, that\u2019s going to make you worried. You got to take that seriously.\u201d Three months ago, in an interview with the Atlantic , he told Jeffrey Goldberg that \u201cthe environment worldwide is scary for a lot of Jewish families\u201d:\n\nBut now comes the hard part: standing up to Israel. How does Obama handle it? Here are some principles that have guided him.\n\nHow does a black president defend his disagreements with the Jewish state while assuring Jews that he has nothing against them?\n\nThe accusation stems largely from Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran and his perpetual friction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. As a member of the ostensibly targeted class, I find the charge ludicrous. It\u2019s one of the few things that has wounded Obama personally , and it\u2019s painful to watch him agonize over it . But it\u2019s also instructive. How does a black president defend his disagreements with the Jewish state\u2014not just on West Bank settlements and discrimination against Israeli Arabs, but also on the genocidal threat posed by Iran\u2014while assuring Jews that he has nothing against them? How do you take on people who claim to speak for a racial, ethnic, or religious group without coming across as a bigot?\n\nOne way to break out of this stalemate is to switch the colors. Every now and then, a situation comes up in which the usual suspects are the victims, or vice versa. That\u2019s what\u2019s now happening to President Obama. The nation\u2019s first black president stands accused of animus against Jews .\n\nWill Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate . He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right .\n\nRacism, sexism, and discrimination of all kinds are hard to talk about. One reason why we don\u2019t make progress on these issues is that we get locked into roles. Some of us feel mistreated or ignored. Others feel silenced or unjustly accused. Sometimes it\u2019s hard to see anything from the other person\u2019s point of view.\n\n5. Respect diversity. Obama reminded Goldberg that Israelis argue about their country\u2019s policies every day. On Friday, he told Forward:\n\nAmerican Jews, like African Americans or any other cohort of Americans, [have] a wide range of concerns. They care about student loans; they care about housing; they care about poverty; they care about women\u2019s health issues. \u2026 I get probably more offended when I hear members of my administration who themselves are Jewish being attacked. You saw this historically sometimes in the African American community, where there\u2019s a difference on policy and somebody starts talking about, \u201cWell, you\u2019re not black enough,\u201d or \u201cYou\u2019re selling out.\u201d And that, I think, is always a dangerous place to go.\n\nRight again. Jews disagree about settlements. Blacks disagree about gun control. Hispanics disagree about the death penalty. The enforcement of orthodoxies within a minority group is just another form of stereotyping.\n\n6. Transcend history. Three months ago, in a speech at Adas Israel in Washington, D.C., Obama said he admired Israelis for rising above centuries of Jewish suffering:\n\nAnd to a young man like me, grappling with his own identity, recognizing the scars of race here in this nation, inspired by the civil rights struggle, the idea that you could be grounded in your history, as Israel was, but not be trapped by it, to be able to repair the world\u2014that idea was liberating.\n\nAmen. Just because your people were victimized doesn\u2019t mean you have to think like a victim. You can change your mentality and your future.\n\n7. Appreciate America. Four years ago, Obama told the Union for Reform Judaism:\n\nLike so many ethnic groups, Jews faced prejudice, and sometimes violence, as they sought their piece of the American Dream. But here, Jews finally found a place where their faith was protected; where hard work and responsibility paid off. \u2026 My father was from Kenya. \u2026 When my Jewish friends tell me about their ancestors, I feel a connection. I know what it\u2019s like to think, \u201cOnly in America is my story even possible.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t naivet\u00e9 about American injustice. It\u2019s a simple recognition that this country, for all its failings, offers freedoms and opens doors that were once closed to minorities here and elsewhere.\n\n8. Friendship includes criticism. In June, Obama told Israel\u2019s Channel 2, \u201cPart of my obligation of being a friend of Israel\u2019s is to speak the truth as I see it.\u201d Last week, he told Forward: \u201cIf you care deeply about Israel, then you have an obligation to be honest about what you think, the same way you would with any friend. And we don\u2019t do anybody, any friend, a service by just rubber-stamping whatever decisions they make.\u201d In the webcast with Jewish groups, he added: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve found after 54 years on this Earth is that my best friends are the ones who I can be honest with. And if I think that they\u2019re wrong on something, I\u2019ve got to be able to say it. \u2026 That\u2019s what being good friends means.\u201d\n\nThose words of wisdom don\u2019t just pertain to Jews who defend segregated buses. They also apply to Muslims who condone violent extremism and to Christians who excuse the Crusades. Stifling disagreements on account of religion, race, or ethnicity would be patronizing.\n\n9. Criticize from within. If you\u2019re going to criticize members of a minority group from the outside, you\u2019d better ground your criticism in the group\u2019s own institutions. That\u2019s what Obama did when Israel\u2019s Channel 2 asked him about the segregation of Palestinians on buses:\n\n[T]he Israeli people I think don\u2019t have to look to me to determine how to feel about a law like that. I think the Israeli people need to look within their own traditions, because the Jewish traditions that helped found Israel have a direct point of view on an issue like that. And I always tell people here, when I was in Jerusalem and I spoke, the biggest applause line I got was when I said, \u201cI know that the people of Israel care about those Palestinian children.\u201d And the applause was overwhelming, because there was a self-recognition. This wasn\u2019t me lecturing them. It was simply reflecting what I\u2019ve seen in my interactions with Israelis, what I\u2019ve seen in terms of Jewish values here in the United States \u2026\n\nEvery religious or ethnic group has traditions and sentiments that express universal values. If you want to promote those values, locate them within the group.\n\n10. Praise from within. You can\u2019t just challenge members of a minority community, no matter how constructively, and expect to be heard. You can\u2019t just assure them that you understand their fears and their predicament. People of one faith or color are just like people of any other: They don\u2019t care what you believe till they believe that you care. That\u2019s one reason why Obama spoke at Adas Israel, as he has many times before, about the role of Jews in the civil rights movement. Two years ago in Israel, Obama explained his feelings of kinship this way:\n\nThis story\u2014from slavery to salvation, of overcoming even the most overwhelming odds\u2014is a message that\u2019s inspired the world. And that includes Jewish Americans but also African Americans, who have so often had to deal with their own challenges, but with whom you have stood shoulder to shoulder. \u2026 African Americans and Jewish Americans marched together at Selma and Montgomery, with rabbis carrying the Torah as they walked. They boarded buses for freedom rides together. They bled together. They gave their lives together: Jewish Americans like Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner alongside [an] African American, James Chaney. \u2026 Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel was born in Poland and lost his mother and sisters to the Nazis. He came to America. He raised his voice for social justice. He marched with Martin Luther King. \u2026 Rabbi Joachim Prinz was born in Germany, expelled by the Nazis and found refuge in America, and he built support for the new State of Israel. And on that August day in 1963, he joined Dr. King at the March on Washington.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:27:59.070+0000"}

{"entityId": 85, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by David Becker/Reuters\n\nAnother week brings another chapter in the endless scandal of Hillary Clinton\u2019s email management.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nOn Monday, the State Department released 4,368 emails\u2014totaling 7,121 pages\u2014from Clinton\u2019s private email server. If you don\u2019t know the story, it\u2019s straightforward: Instead of using her official account, Clinton built a personal server that sent and received messages outside of the State Department\u2019s channels.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRepublicans think this is nefarious. \u201cOn hundreds of occasions, Hillary Clinton\u2019s reckless attempt to skirt transparency laws put sensitive information and our national security at risk,\u201d said Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus in a statement. \u201cWith the FBI continuing to investigate, Hillary Clinton\u2019s growing email scandal shows she cannot be trusted with the White House.\u201d And on the other side, some nervous Democrats are casting everywhere for an alternative to the Democratic front-runner, terrified that Clinton will sink under the scrutiny.\n\nThe downside for Democrats is that the scrutiny won\u2019t end. With thousands of emails left to drop, the story will continue through the year, into 2016. Even if the emails themselves are banal\u2014quick confirmations, unsolicited advice, gossip, requests for television shows, cryptic references to \u201cgefilte fish\u201d\u2014the reoccurring story will bring coverage, spark scandal fatigue, and hurt Clinton with the public.\n\nAs one of the most scrutinized people in American politics, Clinton had a duty to her party to tread carefully and avoid obvious mistakes.\n\nBut there\u2019s an upside. Yes, Clinton and the Democratic Party will deal with bad press over her private email. But it won\u2019t be catastrophic, since\u2014as far as anyone can tell\u2014the former secretary hasn\u2019t done anything illegal, criminal, or that falls under the vague category of \u201cwrongdoing.\u201d For starters, notes David Ignatius for the Washington Post, \u201cthere\u2019s no legal difference whether Clinton and her aides passed sensitive information using her private server or the official \u2018state.gov\u2019 account that many now argue should have been used. Neither system is authorized for transmitting classified information.\u201d Which is to say that, in a sense, it doesn\u2019t matter much that Clinton used a private server\u2014both it and her official account are subject to public records laws, and neither was cleared for classified information. If Clinton or her aides had sent sensitive material to or from the state.gov account, they would have been just as culpable.\n\nTo that point, there\u2019s no evidence\u2014at least not yet\u2014that either Clinton or her aides sent classified material through the system. At most, her emails contained information that was classified after the fact. When Priebus says, \u201cThese new emails show Hillary Clinton exposed even more classified information on her secret server than previously known,\u201d that\u2019s what he means.\n\nBeyond that, Clinton\u2019s behavior doesn\u2019t seem too out-of-step with typical practice. Here\u2019s Ignatius again: \u201cInformal back channels existed long before e-mail. One former State Department official recalled the days when most embassies overseas had only a few phones authorized for secret communications. Rather than go to the executive office to make such a call, officers would use their regular phones, bypassing any truly sensitive details.\u201d The point isn\u2019t that this is OK or that we shouldn\u2019t discuss it, but that\u2014as a matter of practice\u2014we aren\u2019t looking at a serious violation. At worse, so far, we just have misjudgment.\n\nBut on that score, Democrats are right to be angry.

It is neither Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who lorded over the Iowa caucus polls for most of the year, nor Sen. Ted Cruz, the steady conservative heartthrob. Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum, the previous two winners of the caucuses, are nowhere.\n\nInstead it\u2019s \u201cCommentator and Doctor Ben Carson,\u201d as Monmouth University describes him in its latest polling questionnaire, who\u2019s enjoying a modest surge in the heartland. Carson, the soft-spoken retired neurosurgeon who has spent the past couple of years enjoying the lucrative lifestyle of a conservative circuit speaker, is now tied with Trump at 23 percent. And in a Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll released this past weekend, Carson placed second with 18 percent to Trump\u2019s 23 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard CEO who broke out at the \u201ckids\u2019 table\u201d debate in early August, has also vaulted past Walker in the Monmouth poll, reaching third place at 10 percent.\n\nIowa Republicans have spent the summer watching 17 presidential candidates sport blue jeans and eat fried sugar-lard in order to secure their support. After all of it, the overriding feeling right now appears to be: If you\u2019ve held political office before, then these are lean times.\n\n\u201cRegardless of who you support,\u201d the new Monmouth survey asks, \u201cwhat do you think the country needs more in the next president: someone with government experience who knows how to get things done OR someone outside of government who can bring a new approach to Washington?\u201d Twenty-three percent of Iowans preferred the former, 66 percent the latter\u2014and Trump, Carson, and Fiorina, naturally, are soaking up those votes.\n\nNo past or present officeholders\u2014whether they are perceived as establishment or anti-establishment candidates\u2014are catching fire in Iowa. We can all agree that Cruz or Huckabee play up their anti-establishment credentials, but they\u2019re not faring much better in Iowa than the likes of Jeb Bush or Sen. Marco Rubio. That isn\u2019t the rift that matters right now. It\u2019s between politicians and nonpoliticians.\n\nIf you\u2019ve held political office before, then these are lean times.\n\nFor this, as with most things, we can thank Trump. His well-publicized rhetoric against \u201call talk, no action\u201d politicians who are \u201cstupid\u201d and so on opened a great wide lane down which he, Carson, and Fiorina have been speeding. Anger-prone voters who once directed their rage at the GOP establishment still do that, but the Summer of Trump has now conditioned them to widen that circle to include all politicians.\n\nThis is what makes a strategic rethink like the one Walker is attempting so irrelevant. Walker\u2019s precipitous collapse in Iowa, where he had been leading just long enough to solidify expectations that he needed to win it, set off some bells on his team. It was time to retire \u201cFortress Walker,\u201d the overprotected, monotonous black hole of charisma who\u2019d been coasting off the inertia of a single, rousing speech in January. Trump had applied the necessary friction to slow Walker\u2019s Iowa coronation, and Walker\u2019s response would be to adopt a more \u201cTrump-like\u201d tone \u201cin which he would take on the Republican establishment.\u201d\n\nBut Trumpism, when harnessed by non-Trump actors, can badly misfire. It is a dark magic that takes control over its practitioner and leads him to a place where he\u2019s describing the construction of a 5,000-plus-mile-long wall with Canada as a \u201clegitimate\u201d idea. And so on.\n\nAdopting a tone more \u201cfiery,\u201d \u201canti-establishment,\u201d \u201cconfrontational,\u201d or whatever other inexact term we use to describe a politician who\u2019s made the decision to irrationally please base voters misdiagnoses the moment. Walker has been running for office since he was 22 years old and serving since he was 25. He is a career politician whether he likes it or not. It\u2019s not a good look right now.\n\nYou can understand the temptation for Walker, Bush, or any other viable candidate to start smashing lamps or burning Chinese flags. But the best bet is still just to hold steady, not overreact, and wait for the nonpoliticians to crash. Heightened scrutiny and the compression of time typically serve as a career politician\u2019s best friend.

Megyn Kelly and co. grilled him on his liberal past during the Fox News debate early last month, and Bush and other GOP hopefuls have been increasingly trying to paint him with a Democratic-branded brush of late. Such criticism, though, has failed to strike a chord with Trump\u2019s unique band of supporters, many of whom appear more attracted to the businessman\u2019s anti-establishment anger and brash bluster than his specific policy views. When a well-known GOP pollster recently showed a focus group a few of The Donald\u2019s greatest hits\u2014which included his support for single-payer health care\u2014Trump supporters reported liking their man more than they did before they saw the footage.\n\nSo is Bush\u2019s RINO-themed attack doomed to fail? Not in the long run. Trump has a sizeable lead in the polls, both nationally and in the early nominating states\u2014but what he doesn\u2019t have at the moment is enough room to grow his base to remain out in front once the field begins to winnow and his party rallies around one of his more establishment-friendly rivals. Bush, then, needs to keep Trump\u2019s current ceiling in the polls in place. Reminding non-Trump conservatives of his liberal past should help do just that.\n\nBush\u2019s gambit, though, comes with significant risks. As Lindsey Graham, Rick Perry, and Scott Walker can all attest, GOP hopefuls who tangle with Trump this campaign cycle rarely get the better of it. If Jeb has any doubts about just how low Trump is willing to go to take him down, he can head on over to Instagram and watch Trump\u2019s brutal \u201cWillie Horton\u201d-style attack ad that went live on Monday and overlays Bush\u2019s \u201cact of love\u201d quote about immigrants who come to the United State illegally on top of mug shots of alleged murderers.\n\nThe bigger danger to Bush, though, is also in the long term. The Summer of Trump has been dominated by questions of how long the billionaire\u2019s run atop the polls can last, and whether his GOP campaign will end with a bang or with a whimper. The more important question that looms, though, is whether Trump will launch a third-party bid if or when he\u2019s knocked out of the GOP race.

While last year the Supreme Court did find that even corporations have a right to cite religious objections to insurance plans that cover contraception, further efforts to reduce access to contraception have failed. The Department of Health and Human Services has created an accommodation that allows insurance companies to offer coverage directly to women without involving their employers, and efforts by employers to muck up the process have failed in the courts.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nBut now anti-contraception forces have secured a new victory in the district court for the District of Columbia. Judge Richard Leon has ruled that the March for Life, an anti-abortion organization that organizes a yearly march against legal abortion in D.C., can cut off contraception coverage not for religious reasons, but for \u201cmoral\u201d objections. March for Life holds itself out as a nonreligious organization, which is why they had to go this route.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMarch for Life is trying to frame its objections to affordable contraception in terms of abortion, making the same tedious and utterly false argument that some kinds of contraception are equivalent to abortion. \"It opposes methods of contraception that it says can amount to abortion, including hormonal products, intrauterine devices and emergency contraceptives,\" the New York Times reports. At first blush, that might not seem like a big deal, but if you look at the HHS regulations, you'll find that its objection actually covers all forms of listed contraceptions, with the exception of sterilization and the diaphragm.\n\nAs legal expert Ian Millhiser explains at ThinkProgress, the decision is \"hard to follow\" due to its use of pretzel logic, including the argument that religious exemptions to laws discriminate against nonreligious employers. Leon \"appears to object to the government\u2019s decision to exempt churches and other inherently religious organizations from the birth control rules,\" Millhiser writes, \"without also extending this exemption to secular employers because such a rule discriminates against secular employers.\" Since the Supreme Court has already held that you can't just run around refusing to obey any law you want by simply invoking vague \"moral\" objections, I wouldn't bet on this decision holding up on appeal.\n\nStill, this decision is an important one because it blows the doors off the claim that anti-choice objections to contraception coverage are about \"religious liberty\" or \"religious conscience.\" Instead, the lawsuits over Obamacare appear to be another variation of the anti-choice movement's \"incrementalist\" strategy, which has been employed for decades to reduce access to abortion. Instead of trying get an absolute abortion ban passed, which would likely never happen, the anti-choice movement chips away at access by passing a bunch of small regulations, hoping to bury women and providers in so much red tape that they simply give up.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:28:54.157+0000"}

But the effect of this release is more anthropological, given the lack of a hard-news smoking gun relevant to the current controversy over what exactly was on Clinton\u2019s private email server.

They will also point out the emails where Clinton demands someone be held accountable for some error, or where she writes a friendly note to a co-worker, or where she discusses saving children in third-world countries.\n\nThose who do not support Clinton will see something else: redactions. To those elements that bank on conspiracy, each redaction is the cover-up of some truly devious crime. What does Clinton write in that redacted response to Davis\u2019 whiny email? Perhaps that is where she orders the murder of the American ambassador in Benghazi, two years in advance. (These Clintons, they plan their worst deeds well in advance.) There are those who will see any whited-out strip of text and presume that here Clinton gives Huma Abedin the precise description of how she \u201ctook out\u201d Vince Foster.\n\nThe main effect of these email releases is to keep afloat in the public mind the very fact that Clinton is suffering from a controversy over her private email server.

They asked the women what birth-control methods they had been using when they conceived. Thirty-six percent said they had used no method. Forty percent said they had used condoms. Twelve percent said they had been on the pill. Fewer than one percent said they had used an IUD or implant. Compared with other Spanish women of childbearing age, women who got abortions were 15 times less likely to have used IUDs, vasectomy, or tubal ligation. Birth control hadn\u2019t failed in Spain. Inferior birth control had failed. The best birth control had worked.\n\nThis gap accounts for the disappointing results noted by birth-control skeptics. Take Spain. According to the conference of bishops , from 1997 to 2007, \u201ca 63 percent increase in the use of contraceptives was accompanied by a 108 percent increase in the rate of elective abortions.\u201d But when you look more closely at the data , you find that Spaniards chose the least effective contraceptives. Reliance on condoms nearly doubled. Reliance on pills, patches, and vaginal rings increased by about 70 percent. The most reliable methods, IUDs and female sterilization, actually declined in use.\n\nThis kind of birth control often fails. It\u2019s usually not the device that fails. It\u2019s the user. You neglect to take the pill or put on the condom. In the heat of excitement, you forget or screw up. The authoritative table of failure rates , published four years ago by James Trussell of Princeton University, shows an enormous gap between \u201cperfect use\u201d and \u201ctypical use.\u201d The pill, when perfectly applied, has a failure rate of 0.3 percent. But in real life, its failure rate is 9 percent. Over the course of a year, in a pool of 1,000 women, that\u2019s the difference between three pregnancies and 90. Among teenagers, the real-world failure rate is a whopping 20 percent . Condoms, when used perfectly, have a 2 percent failure rate. But in normal use, their failure rate is 18 percent.\n\nCritics of contraception point to several studies in which access to birth control increased, or more people claimed to be using it, while the abortion rate held steady or went up. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops cites one study in Spain , another in England , and another in Sweden . But there\u2019s a common thread in these and other episodes of birth-control failure: The contraception that was distributed or selected\u2014condoms in Spain, pills in Sweden\u2014required diligent use.\n\nIn the course of this debate, I\u2019ve been name-checked as somebody who used to believe in a contraceptive approach to reducing abortion but no longer does . That\u2019s not quite right. What I\u2019ve learned is that contraceptives can make a big difference\u2014bigger, I suspect, than abortion laws can\u2014but it matters enormously which contraceptives we\u2019re talking about . Some, such as pills and condoms, require repeated, consistent application . Others, such as intrauterine devices and hormonal implants, don\u2019t. The latter methods\u2014long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs\u2014have a much lower failure rate. And we now have very good evidence that they can prevent millions of abortions.\n\nThe idea that contraception wouldn\u2019t prevent unintended pregnancies strikes many people as absurd. But these conservatives have a point. Beyond a certain level of saturation, the availability of pills and condoms affects pregnancy rates less than one might expect . McArdle, echoing Douthat, rejects the idea that \u201cthe main thing standing between America and fewer abortions is better government birth-control policy.\u201d\n\nDefunding Planned Parenthood makes even less sense. Federal law prohibits the use of public money for elective abortions , by Planned Parenthood or anyone else. Instead, these funds go to Planned Parenthood\u2019s contraceptive services . Planned Parenthood is the world\u2019s leading provider of birth control. By undercutting this work, Republicans are threatening to cause an increase in the number of unintended pregnancies. And that, in turn, would lead to more abortions.\n\nThe ostensible basis for this attack is a series of undercover videos in which pro-lifers, posing as buyers for medical research, try to bargain with Planned Parenthood officials over fetal tissue. But if you\u2019re interested in preventing abortions, the videos are irrelevant. They depict conversations about how, not whether, abortions will be done. If such discussions were outlawed, not one abortion would be prevented.\n\nThe Republican Party says it\u2019s against abortion. But now Republican governors, members of Congress, and presidential candidates are trying to defund Planned Parenthood . Some are threatening to shut down the government if they don\u2019t get their way. If you\u2019re against abortion, this should worry you.\n\nSince 2007, researchers have launched at least five projects to promote LARCs. Their goal has been to make the devices more widely available, affordable, familiar, and popular. In each case, unintended pregnancies and abortions have come down. Here\u2019s what the studies show.\n\nIowa: From 2007 to 2013, the state pumped extra money into family planning for low-income women. Among other things, the project subsidized LARCs, promoted them through media campaigns, and funded training in LARC insertions. From 2005 to 2012, the percentage of Iowa family planning clients using LARCs increased from less than 1 percent to 15 percent. Statewide, the proportion of women using LARCs rose from 1 in 1,000 to 15 in 1,000. Meanwhile, the abortion rate fell from 8.7 per 1,000 to 6.7 per 1,000, a decline of more than 20 percent. The number of LARC users increased by about 8,000, and the number of abortions fell by about 1,300. Unintended pregnancy decreased in Iowa while it rose in Minnesota and Nebraska. When the researchers compared data across the state\u2019s 26 regions, they found that each 1-percent increase in LARC use correlated, on average, with a 4-percent drop in the abortion rate.\n\nNew Zealand: In 2008, for 10 weeks, a clinic promoted LARCs and offered them for free to women who had come for abortions. By the end of this period, the percentage of women choosing post-abortion LARCs had increased from 45 to 61. The efficacy of LARCs was diluted, because the project\u2019s managers included a less reliable method in this category\u2014depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (sold as Depo-Provera), an injection that lasts 12 weeks\u2014didn\u2019t provide implants, and counted women as LARC users even if they got rid of the device during the next two years. Nevertheless, the subsequent abortion rate\u2014the percentage of women who returned for a second abortion within two years\u2014was 55 percent lower among LARC users than among non-LARC users. Among the 310 women who chose LARCs, only 20 returned for an abortion, and 18 of these women had either stopped using a LARC method within six months or had not reported whether they were still using the LARC. Among the 106 women who chose and stuck with a hormonal IUD, not one returned for an abortion.\n\nColorado: Beginning in 2009, the state\u2019s family planning clinics conducted a program much like Iowa\u2019s. From 2008 to 2011, the percentage of women aged 15 to 24 who chose LARCs at these clinics quadrupled, from 4.5 to 19.4. Meanwhile, the percentage of women who chose pills declined from 49 to 36. From 2008 to 2013, the teen birth rate fell more sharply in Colorado than in any other state. An analysis by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded that in four years, the LARC initiative cut the teen birth rate in Colorado\u2019s poorer counties by 6 to 8 percent. From 2008 to 2011, the teen abortion rate in Colorado counties targeted by the initiative plummeted 34 percent. This drop exceeded the 29 percent decline in outlying counties, and researchers believe some of that 29-percent decline was due to teens from outlying counties using clinics in the targeted counties. Among women aged 20 to 24, the abortion rate increased by 6 percent in outlying counties but fell 18 percent in targeted counties.\n\nSt. Louis: From 2007 to 2011, more than 9,000 women in the St. Louis area, nearly all of them sexually experienced, were offered any contraceptive of their choice at no cost. They were told each method\u2019s failure rate, and LARCs were available for immediate insertion. Seventy-five percent of the women chose LARCs. Over the next five years, the pregnancy rate among teens in the program was 40 percent lower than the rate among all U.S. teens. It was nearly 80 percent lower than the rate among sexually experienced U.S. teens. The abortion rate among women in the program was 60 percent lower than the rate among other women in the St. Louis region. At the city\u2019s main abortion clinic, from 2008 to 2010, the number of abortions performed on local women fell 20 percent, while the number of abortions performed on women from outside the metro area didn\u2019t change.\n\nThe St. Louis study also tracked each participant and calculated how many teens got pregnant for every 1,000 who used a given birth-control method over the course of a year. For the pill, the number of annual pregnancies was 57. For the hormonal IUD, it was 5. For the copper IUD and the hormonal implant, it was zero. Overall, compared to women who chose LARCs, those who didn\u2019t were 22 times more likely to become pregnant unintentionally.\n\nPlanned Parenthood: In 2011, researchers undertook a randomized controlled trial at 40 Planned Parenthood clinics across the United States. At some clinics, staffers received training in LARCs and their effectiveness. At other clinics, they didn\u2019t. The program offered no discount for LARCs, but it still made a difference. At the program sites, 28 percent of young women who received contraceptive counseling chose LARCs. At the nonprogram sites, 17 percent chose LARCs. A year later, the pregnancy rate was 19 percent lower for women who had attended program sites than it was for women who had attended nonprogram sites.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:29:03.376+0000"}

{"entityId": 97, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\n\nThink back to this time in the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and it\u2019s easy to see the similiarities. Mitt Romney was the most plausible nominee in a wide field of contenders, but he couldn\u2019t catch fire with the GOP base. Instead, he watched a parade of outsiders and conservative alternatives take their turns in the sun, from Rick Perry and Herman Cain to Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nBut behind this chaos was a certain order. For as much as Romney struggled against conservative enthusiasm for vanity candidates, he also held a steady place in the polls, with strong fundraising and a solid, professional organization. Romney wasn\u2019t the first choice for the majority of Republican primary voters, but he was the first alternate for when everyone\u2019s various infatuations died down. \u201cRomney was viewed positively by likely Republican primary voters regardless of whether they were conservatives or moderates, pro-life or pro-choice, relatively wealthy or not, Tea Party members or not,\u201d write political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck in The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election. What\u2019s more, Romney had high ratings among voters who backed candidates like Cain and Gingrich: \u201cAbout 74 percent of conservative Republican primary voters had a favorable view of him,\u201d they write. When it was time to choose, Romney was the strongest contender, and Republicans were ready to pick him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis year, with Donald Trump leading the fray, there\u2019s something of a consolidated conservative movement\u2014the real estate magnate draws from the same voters who gave Cain and Gingrich their time in the light. And in that space, he\u2019s joined by Ben Carson, the neurosurgeon-turned public speaker-turned presidential candidate, who hits second place in most national polls of the GOP primary field. But votes are just one part of this game; you need party support too, and that\u2019s just not in the cards for either Trump or Carson. Both will eventually fade from view\u2014or at least the Republican nominating process\u2014as voters start the more serious search for a nominee. The problem, this time, is that there isn\u2019t a Romney\u2014an obvious choice for consolidation who is on the steady march to inevitability. Instead, there\u2019s a collection of \u201cplausible\u201d candidates who all seem too flawed to succeed.\n\nTake John Kasich. The Ohio governor has a great r\u00e9sum\u00e9: a former congressman and chairman of the House Budget Committee who had a lucrative stint in investment banking before winning a tight race in a swing state. And he\u2019s poised to excel in a general election; an advocate for the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care Act, he\u2019s a genuine \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d with a strong message on mental health and drug treatment services. But that\u2019s also his problem. The Republican Party is still committed to the destruction of Obamacare, and Kasich doesn\u2019t just support one of its largest components\u2014he also shames Republicans who don\u2019t. \u201cNow, when you die and get to the meeting with St. Peter, he\u2019s probably not going to ask you much about what you did about keeping government small,\u201d Kasich said at the presidential debate. \u201cBut he is going to ask you what you did for the poor. You better have a good answer.\u201d\n\nThe problem is that there isn\u2019t a Romney\u2014an obvious choice for consolidation who is on the steady march to inevitability.\n\nWhich is to say that if a \u201cplausible\u201d nominee needs to be acceptable to conservatives, Kasich is at a serious disadvantage. They might tolerate the Medicaid expansion, but they won\u2019t stand for that kind of attack. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2014a relative moderate\u2014is in the same boat, with the added anchor of scandal. He\u2019s trying, though; on Saturday, in an awkward pitch to conservative voters, he promised to \u201ctrack\u201d unauthorized immigrants like FedEx packages, if elected president.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has the conservative bona fides and the r\u00e9sum\u00e9. But his credentials can\u2019t compensate for his poor performance. Walker is too slow to respond to criticism, and too flat-footed against Trump, who has boxed him out of his political space.\n\nWhich brings us to Jeb Bush, who looks Romney-esque with his deep pockets and strong ties to the Republican establishment. With backing from prominent parts of the GOP, he has the key advantage in a presidential primary\u2014party support. That, and money, can keep him buoyed if he stumbles in the early primaries, and eventually bring him to victory. But that assumes a strong campaign, which, in part, assumes a strong candidate. That\u2019s not the Jeb we have. Like Walker, Bush has stumbled over Trump and his attacks, with ineffectual pushback that leads to more mistakes. Last week, addressing immigration, Bush blamed \u201canchor babies\u201d on Asian immigrants, spreading offense to new demographics. And over the weekend, reports Politico, Bush lost three top fundraisers, amid reports of \u201cinternal personality conflicts and questions about the strength of his candidacy.\u201d Winning campaigns don\u2019t tend to have this problem; Romney didn\u2019t.\n\nThe only \u201cplausible\u201d candidate left\u2014someone to bridge the gaps among all party factions\u2014is Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. What he lacks in Bush\u2019s money or Walker\u2019s electoral success he has in raw talent: Rubio is the most gifted communicator of the field, with enough savvy to avoid Trump\u2019s traps. He doesn\u2019t engage Trump on immigration or try to swat him away. Instead, he talks policy, tries to distinguish himself with substance, and marches toward his goal.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:29:08.628+0000"}

Photo by Ralf Nau/Thinkstock.\n\nThe tiny, shelf-level security camera at the grocery store is watching you. It\u2019s recording your height, gender, race, and approximate age, as well as the brand of orange juice you just placed in your shopping cart. Oh, and it also knows exactly who you are.\n\nThis is the kind of eerie scenario\u2014however hypothetical\u2014that flickers to mind when many people think about facial recognition technology, the likes of which famously featured in Tom Cruise\u2019s Minority Report as an ultraintrusive device for customized advertising. Though we\u2019re nowhere near the world described by that film, the rapid advent of facial recognition software\u2014programs that \u201crecognize\u201d a person by using visual data to turn his or her face into a unique mathematical space\u2014into daily life has brought out some of our deepest anxieties about privacy and control. Unease was rampant, for example, when British grocery chain Tesco installed cameras to scan customers\u2019 faces in 2013. The FBI\u2019s Next Generation Identification system, launched in 2014, stoked fears about a totalitarian dystopia. Just recently, Microsoft\u2019s new Windows operating system produced a few squirms for featuring a login program that can supposedly tell identical twins apart.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhile people have been uncomfortable in the past about other forms of biometric identification, such as fingerprint scanners, something about facial recognition prompts an extraordinary level of panic. In headlines and conversations alike, the word creepy is thrown around without a second thought. But we give our names and identities away online all the time\u2014so what\u2019s so deeply troubling about revealing our faces?\n\nOne very rational source of wariness about the technology is, of course, facial recognition\u2019s complicated relationship with privacy laws. Because federal laws don\u2019t yet exist in the United States to govern this relatively new development, people in the majority of states can be recorded by the technology without giving their informed consent. Most other countries haven\u2019t set rules around this, either. A colossal privacy issue is at hand\u2014especially because cameras, unlike fingerprint pads, can collect high-stakes identifying data without ever revealing their presence in the room. That\u2019s also alarming since the most advanced programs can now recognize a person\u2019s mug from any angle. While one could always resort to drastic measures to hide from facial recognition, the idea of donning a mask to go out in public obviously doesn\u2019t have mass appeal. Governments need to adequately address these privacy gaps, and we\u2019re right to remain suspicious of the technology as long as it remains legally unchecked.\n\nBut let\u2019s say companies and privacy advocates come to agreement on policies that would keep personal data secure and give people control of how their faces are tracked. It boils down to one thing: Facial recognition simply creeps people out.\n\nScience fiction and media hype are party to blame for our apprehension. But it\u2019s also a fascinating matter of psychology\u2014one that has to do with the basic human instinct to run from prying eyes. Brian Mennecke, an associate professor at Iowa State University who conducts consumer research, explains that facial recognition technology tends to give people the unpleasant feeling that they\u2019re being singled out and cornered. It\u2019s not the idea of being seen that\u2019s unnerving, but rather the fear of then being remembered and followed, he says.\n\nThese fears, though, are largely irrational. Proof of this is the fact that we\u2019re intensely alarmed by some forms of facial recognition and not others. For instance: Mennecke says that most of us are much more comfortable with unknown Facebook employees in California looking at our faces than security guards keeping tabs on them from control rooms in malls. That\u2019s because computers depersonalize and distance experiences, and the lack of physical proximity with those on the other side of the camera makes us far more trusting. Mennecke adds that, online, there\u2019s also a \u201cwe\u2019re in a group, and it\u2019s not about me individually\u201d mentality. In the flesh, people become much more conscious of their presence as individuals\u2014and as potential targets.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:29:12.338+0000"}

Neither of these actions would be easy to do, but either would have sent a powerful message to industry: Starting now, climate change concerns trump energy exploration, period.\n\nClimate activists vociferously opposed the approval of Shell\u2019s permit: Last month a group of protesters in kayaks briefly blockaded an Arctic-bound Shell support ship while it was in a Portland, Oregon, port.

No one ever says no,\u201d McKibben wrote.\n\nAfter decades of delay, scientists now say the world\u2014especially countries like the United States with historically high emissions\u2014needs to immediately embark on a radical path of truly bold action on climate change. So far, Obama\u2019s plan for carbon cutting, despite being loudly trumpeted by the administration, has been middling at best. For many environmental activists, Obama\u2019s approval of Shell\u2019s Arctic drilling permit is the icing on an extremely hypocritical cake.\n\nCredo\u2019s Elijah Zarlin, who worked for Obama\u2019s 2008 election campaign, calls the rhetoric from the White House surrounding Obama\u2019s visit to Alaska \u201cstunningly brazen,\u201d given the go-ahead for Shell to drill in the Arctic.\n\n\u201cThe hypocrisy just speaks for itself when you hear him saying things like \u2018this is our wakeup call,\u2019 given his record on oil, gas, and coal extraction,\u201d Zarlin said. \u201cHis words [on climate change], which are powerful, just ring more and more hollow. Ultimately, it just makes me sad, because I believed in the guy.\u201d\n\nOn the trip, Obama will become the first sitting American president to visit the Alaskan Arctic. He\u2019ll travel to the coastal village of Kotzebue, where Shell has some drilling equipment stationed, to view the effects of rising seas and melting permafrost firsthand. He\u2019ll also film an episode of Running Wild With Bear Grylls, in which he will discuss climate change and receive a \u201ccrash course in survival techniques,\u201d according to a statement from NBC.\n\nThe effects of global warming in Alaska continue to accelerate. This year\u2019s off-the-charts wildfire season was a recordbreaker, burning through even the permafrost. Just last week, another startling \u201chaul-out\u201d of walruses was observed as thousands of animals were forced ashore by the lack of sea ice in the Alaskan Arctic, not far from where Obama will visit.

(Davis filed the application to Justice Elena Kagan, who will likely refer it to the full court.) As you may recall, Davis refused to grant marriage licenses to gay couples following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Obergefell v. Hodges. Several couples sued, and Davis\u2014a taxpayer-funded county clerk\u2014chose to stop issuing marriage licenses altogether. A federal judge ordered her to continue doing her job, but Davis refused, citing her First Amendment rights. The Sixth Circuit declined to stay the judge\u2019s order, explaining that \u201cit cannot be defensibly argued\u201d that Davis\u2019 rights were violated.\n\nDavis\u2019 application to the Supreme Court is less an application for a preliminary injunction than a sententious protest against Obergefell. It accuses the Obergefell majority of \u201credefining\u201d marriage\u2014a staple of right-wing argot\u2014three times. It sneers that the ruling was decided by a bare \u201c5-4 majority.\u201d It quotes, extensively and approvingly, the Obergefell dissenters\u2019 ominous warnings about the apocalyptic clash between marriage equality and religious freedom. And, in case you didn\u2019t get the point, it actually refers to \u201csame-sex \u2018marriage\u2019 \u201d\u2014complete with contemptuous scare quotes around \u201cmarriage.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt would be easy to write a story mocking the application\u2019s histrionics and thinly veiled animus. But quite frankly, I\u2019m growing a bit concerned about Davis\u2019 lawyers. Davis is being represented by the Liberty Counsel, a far-right fringe group that specializes in anti-gay litigation. (Naturally, it is also a Christian ministry and a tax-exempt nonprofit.) Founder and Chairman Mathew D. Staver has used Davis\u2019 case to raise money and boost publicity for his group, going so far as to hold a rally for Davis. In his spare time, Staver has continued to participate in the Faith and Freedom radio show; in recent weeks, he has described the newly gay-tolerant Boy Scouts as \u201ca playground for pedophiles\u201d and compared acceptance of Obergefell to turning over a Jew to the Nazis.\n\nLaw firms regularly use sexy cases to increase their own profiles, and it\u2019s perfectly fine to bandy about your client to further a constitutional cause. (Gay rights litigators do it all the time.) But Staver is taking things too far. The first sign of trouble arose early in the case: When a federal judge ordered Davis to issue licenses or be held in contempt of court, the Liberty Counsel advised her to disobey the ruling. Good lawyers don\u2019t usually tell their clients to defy lawful court orders, especially when jail time is a real possibility. Yet the Liberty Counsel didn\u2019t mind putting their client at risk\u2014perhaps because the idea of a middle-aged woman being hauled off to jail for purportedly following her conscience would send thousands of anti-gay Americans reaching for their pitchforks (and checkbooks).", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:29:49.552+0000"}

The event was something of a response to an address by Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month, in which the Israeli Prime Minister made his case against the nuclear agreement with Iran currently under consideration by Congress.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nObama made the now familiar case that the deal \u201cdoesn\u2019t rely on trust, it relies on verification\u201d and that supporting it does not require trusting Iran\u2019s intentions. He said that disagreement between the U.S. and Israeli government over the deal \u201cdoes not affect the core commitments we have to each other\u201d and that \u201cthe commitment to Israel is sacrosanct and it is non-partisan. It always has been and it always will be.\u201d Speaking to fears in Israel and the Jewish community about anti-Semitic rhetoric from the Iranian government, the president said, \u201cI think that as an African-American, I understand that history teaches us that man can be cruel to man and you have to take threats seriously. But history also teaches us that sometimes the best security is to enter into negotiations with your enemies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nObama has made many of these points before in press conferences and speeches since the deal was signed. The administration\u2019s aggressive sales pitch for the deal has been premised on the notion that if critics only fully understood it, they would realize that it\u2019s the best choice for the security of the U.S. as well as Israel. As the president told viewers today, \u201cthe more information, the more confident you\u2019ll be that this is the right thing to do.\u201d As I\u2019ve written before, I think this premise is flawed.\n\nNo realistically conceivable deal was ever going to satisfy the critics now arguing against it. This opposition is not based on the specifics of the agreement. In part, it\u2019s knee-jerk partisanship and pandering\u2014at the moment it looks as if not a single Congressional Republican will support the deal\u2014as well as an honest disagreement about the nature of the Iranian regime. President Obama and the agreement\u2019s supporters believe that for all their many flaws, Iran\u2019s leaders are rational actors who can be influenced through incentives. Netanyahu and opponents of the deal believe they are ideologically-driven, inveterate antagonists of the U.S. and Israel who will take any opportunity to cheat on their nuclear commitments and provoke terrorism.\n\nGiven this seemingly unbridgeable divide, as well as the fact that the deal now seems almost guaranteed to pass, it\u2019s odd that Obama is even bothering to make such an aggressive sales pitch. Part of the reason, as shown by today\u2019s event, is that many of the deal\u2019s most prominent opponents are American Jewish leaders and organizations, many of whom have long suggested that this administration is less than forthright in its support for Israel\u2014an allegation that clearly makes the administration uncomfortable, no matter how ludicrous they may find it.\n\nThe debate over the deal has spawned a side debate over whether proponents of the deal have indulged in coded anti-Semitism by suggesting that opponents don\u2019t have America\u2019s best interests in mind. Some have also suggested that all the attention on the Jewish affiliations of anti-deal members of Congress like Chuck Schumer and Steve Israel crosses a line by suggesting that American Jewish leaders have dual loyalties.\n\nThis is silly. It\u2019s not exactly a mystery that opponents of the deal have targeted Jewish members of Congress as well as those like Cory Booker and Bob Menendez of New Jersey who represent significant Jewish constituencies. With AIPAC spending a record $1.67 million this year as it has lobbied against the deal, it\u2019s hard to pretend pressure from pro-Israel groups isn\u2019t a factor in this debate.\n\nSpeaking to the issue of tone, the president today argued \u201cat no point have I ever suggested that someone is a warmonger\u201d and said he believes their concerns are sincere. (This is, perhaps, a bit of a stretch.) He also noted that Jewish New York Congressman Jerrold Nadler, who supports the deal, has been \u201cattacked in ways that are appalling.\u201d\n\nBaseless or not, the White House would presumably like to avoid the impression that it\u2019s blas\u00e9 or even hostile to Jewish concerns, particularly heading into an election season where Obama and his former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton will be repeatedly bashed on the campaign trail for abandoning U.S. support for Israel. On the other hand, it\u2019s the Jewish community as a whole isn\u2019t actually that concerned about the deal.

With nearly 4 million followers, Trump has more than four times the reach of Marco Rubio, who has the second-most followers in the Republican field. Trump\u2019s particular brand of belligerence is perfectly suited to the hostile world of Twitter, where 140-word nuance is difficult to find. This past week alone, Trump has found success by bludgeoning his rivals, both real and perceived: His attacks on Lindsey Graham and Megyn Kelly were retweeted more than 3,000 times, while his digs at Jeb Bush and Bernie Sanders both received more than 4,000 retweets.\n\nLast thing: When it doubt, attack!", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:31:15.622+0000"}

Josh McKoon, the rabidly anti-gay Georgia Republican legislator who sponsored a failed \u201creligious liberty\u201d bill last spring. Like most conservatives, McKoon initially peddled the laughable line that his bill wasn\u2019t intended to undercut LGBT rights. But when a moderate Republican called his bluff, proposing a simple amendment to clarify that the bill did not legalize discrimination, McKoon let the fa\u00e7ade drop. \u201cThat amendment,\u201d he fumed, \u201cwould completely undercut the purpose of the bill.\u201d With those words, McKoon finally admitted what so many would not: The whole point of \u201creligious liberty\u201d bills is to nullify LGBT nondiscrimination measures.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nSince then, the Georgia GOP has split wide open over McKoon\u2019s bill. Religious conservatives in the party vehemently support it; business-minded moderates, who fear an Indiana-style backlash, vigorously oppose it. (The latter camp was, until recently, led by Jewish Rep. Mike Jacobs and supported by the Anti-Defamation League, which has led to some disturbing dog whistles.*) Now McKoon is lining up his soldiers for the next charge\u2014and, in doing so, dropping all pretexts about the true intentions of his bill. In a remarkable speech, McKoon pilloried companies like Delta, Coca-Cola, and Home Depot, which are headquartered in Georgia and spoke out against the bill. These companies, McKoon claimed, are the main roadblock to the bill\u2019s passage:\n\nWe\u2019ve had this problem because very large multi-national corporations that are headquartered in this state\u2014their executives, many of whom are not from Georgia, have different values than you and I do. They think that their cultural norms, their liberal, far-left cultural norms, should be applied to our state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMcKoon should be commended for his honesty. Sure, he\u2019s cribbing the tactics of Southern white supremacist groups in the civil rights era, who regularly complained that groups like the NAACP were just outside agitators who didn\u2019t share or understand Southern values. But in doing so, he has abandoned the pretense that his bill is about anything other than legally disadvantaging LGBT people. Real Georgians, McKoon implies, should reject these liberal elite outsiders\u2019 \u201cfar-left cultural norms\u201d\u2014and embrace discrimination.\n\nI recognize that, for more tolerant Americans, it might be uncomfortable to watch lawmakers use white supremacist language to argue openly for the legal debasement of LGBT Georgians. But I promise\u2014it really is better this way. For nearly two years, anti-gay activists were either too pusillanimous or mendacious to own up to the objective of their \u201creligious liberty\u201d measures. If McKoon and his ilk are truly ready to move beyond such obfuscation, we can finally discuss in earnest whether individuals and businesses should be given special rights to discriminate. For conservatives, who are already facing repercussions at the polls for their extremism, that\u2019s a losing debate.

{"entityId": 112, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nWhen it comes to Hillary Clinton and her place in the presidential primary, the political media needs to start being able to hold two ideas in mind at once. The first, and most familiar to anyone who has followed this campaign, is that Clinton is vulnerable.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nHer email\u2014and use of a private server\u2014has grown from a scandal to a fiasco. The FBI has stepped in with an investigation to see if Clinton\u2019s system was compromised by foreign hackers, and to see if she knowingly passed classified information\u2014including \u201ctop secret\u201d intelligence\u2014through her server. Clinton is also due to face a House select committee for a public hearing on the 2012 attack on an American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. Maybe she\u2019ll perform well and avoid missteps. But she might stumble, exposing herself and her campaign to more attacks and scrutiny.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere have also been challenges on key policy questions. To the most vocal progressive activists, Clinton still needs to account for her role in the Bill Clinton White House on issues like mass incarceration, police militarization, and the drug war. As first lady, for example, she pushed the \u201cthree strikes\u201d provision of the 1994 crime bill and supported greater prison time for offenders. \u201cThere is something wrong when a crime bill takes six years to work its way through Congress and the average criminal serves only four,\u201d she said at the time. The same is true for her positions in the Senate, where she voted in favor of federal police funding that flowed to SWAT teams and other vectors for militarization. There\u2019s also her economic record: As a senator from New York, she backed a 2001 bill that would become the much loathed (among liberals) 2005 bankruptcy law. And she still hasn\u2019t acknowledged or apologized for the racially tinged rhetoric used by her campaign in the most heated moments of her 2008 race against Barack Obama.\n\nBut, again, this isn\u2019t the whole story. There\u2019s still that other idea about Clinton to keep in mind, even as we consider her problems and weaknesses: Clinton is winning the Democratic presidential primary, and it\u2019s not even close.\n\nDespite the reporting around it\u2014which has treated her as a losing candidate\u2014the latest Quinnipiac poll shows Clinton with a wide lead over her opponents. She wins 45 percent of the Democratic Party, to 22 percent for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and 18 percent for Vice President Joe Biden. Aggregate polls show a similar picture; in the Huffington Post Pollster average, Clinton holds 48.9 percent of the primary vote, compared with 22.5 percent for Sanders and 12.5 percent for Biden. There\u2019s no contest.\n\nThere\u2019s an easy and obvious rejoinder: What about 2008? Wasn\u2019t Clinton winning at this point in that primary; wasn\u2019t she \u201cinevitable\u201d? And look what happened: She lost to a popular upstart with the public behind him.\n\nThis sounds persuasive, but it doesn\u2019t fit the facts. As writer Harry Enten notes for FiveThirtyEight, Clinton was much weaker in the previous primary than she is now. \u201cBack in 2008,\u201d he writes, \u201cshe was trailing in early Iowa polls. She earned only a third of the vote in early New Hampshire polls and was below 40 percent nationally.\u201d Now, by contrast, she\u2019s well ahead in national polls, well ahead in Iowa, and only somewhat behind in New Hampshire.\n\nMoreover, because primaries aren\u2019t popularity contests, the most important measure of success is party support. Barack Obama wasn\u2019t an upstart; behind his run was the party machinery, or at least the part that didn\u2019t want Clinton. Today, where do Democratic fundraisers stand? What do Democratic interests groups think? How will Democratic lawmakers act?\n\nOn each score, Clinton isn\u2019t just winning\u2014she dominates. Most fundraisers are in her corner; it\u2019s why Biden will have a hard time raising money if he decides to run. Interest groups are still quiet, but Democratic lawmakers are overwhelmingly pro-Hillary. Clinton has more than 100 endorsements from sitting Democrats, including seven governors and 29 senators. Biden, who doesn\u2019t appear to have decided whether to run yet, has two. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley has one. Bernie Sanders has none. This is unprecedented. Not only is Clinton ahead of her previous endorsement total, according to analysis by FiveThirtyEight, but she\u2019s racked up more endorsements of significance at this stage of the race than any nonincumbent Democratic presidential candidate, ever. At this point in 1999, for instance, Al Gore had two-thirds as many endorsement points (a measure that weights senators and governors more than House representatives) as Clinton does now; at this point in 2003, John Kerry had less than one-tenth Clinton\u2019s current support; at this point in 2007, Obama had less than one-sixth. The closest analogue to Clinton isn\u2019t anyone in the Democratic Party\u2014it\u2019s George W. Bush, who had much greater endorsement support than Clinton at this stage of the 2000 Republican presidential primary and ultimately won easily, despite an early challenge from John McCain.\n\nOf course, life is arbitrary, and Hillary\u2019s campaign could still fall apart. It\u2019s not hard to imagine how it might happen: The FBI investigation could lead to indictments, ending Clinton\u2019s campaign with a court appearance. Or, she could refuse to answer any questions on her previous positions and open space for a challenger.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:31:59.504+0000"}
{"entityId": 113, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Christopher Gregory/Getty Images\n\nBy now it is fairly clear that Donald Trump can get away with expressing views that would sink almost any other GOP candidate. While the other Republican presidential contenders had readied themselves for several rounds of more-conservative-than-thou\u2014the usual contest in the GOP primary\u2014Trump has blithely abandoned any number of conservative orthodoxies, and he doesn\u2019t appear to have lost any supporters in the process. Indeed, he may well have gained a few. This week, pollster Frank Luntz conducted a focus group of current and former Trump supporters. For over two and a half hours, Luntz probed their reactions to Trump\u2019s past support for abortion rights and stricter gun laws, among other heresies, and he found that none of them seemed to care.\n\nLuntz\u2019s findings help explain the persistence of Trump\u2019s lead in polls of GOP primary voters over the past several weeks, even as Jeb Bush has been on a mission to prove that Trump is a barely disguised tax-and-spend liberal. Can you imagine another Republican praising Canada\u2019s single-payer health care system and socialized medicine in Scotland, as Trump did during the Fox News GOP debate? And then getting away with it? In a recent interview with Chuck Todd of Meet the Press, Trump said that he was \u201cfine with affirmative action,\u201d having \u201clived with it for a long time.\u201d Suffice it to say, conservative opponents of racial preferences were less than pleased. But have Trump\u2019s diehard supporters been abandoning him in droves? They haven\u2019t yet.\n\nTrump has a realistic shot at building a lasting political movement that operates outside of the mainstream American right.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn that same Meet the Press interview, Trump warned against corporations that \u201chave no loyalty to this country,\u201d language that brought to mind John Kerry\u2019s campaign against \u201cBenedict Arnold CEOs.\u201d Yes, Trump followed up by saying we ought to cut corporate taxes to keep these companies from fleeing our shores\u2014a stance embraced by most mainstream Republicans\u2014but it\u2019s the vehemence with which Trump attacks CEOs that is noteworthy. It\u2019s very hard to imagine a member of the Bush family using the same language\u2014or a libertarian conservative like Rand Paul for that matter. And while several of Trump\u2019s rivals for the GOP nomination have either embraced a flat tax outright or praised the idea in principle, the billionaire real estate developer offered a robust defense of progressive taxation on Fox & Friends. When asked about hedge-fund managers in particular, Trump said without hesitation that \u201cthey\u2019re not paying enough tax.\u201d He then implied that well-heeled hedge-funders have been shielded from higher taxes by politicians who depend on their campaign contributions. This is very much in keeping with the way Trump has ridiculed his opponents for being so dependent on wealthy donors.\n\nWhat does all of this mean? It means that Trump has a realistic shot at building a lasting political movement that operates outside of the mainstream American right. I\u2019m of the view that the 20-25 percent of the GOP primary vote that Trump currently commands is close to his ceiling, and that he is unlikely to win the Republican presidential nomination. Eventually, the rest of the party will rally around a candidate capable of defeating him. I am also convinced, however, that Trump represents a serious political current in American life, which rhymes with, though it is not identical to, many of the nationalist and populist political movements that have been roiling European politics for the last decade and a half.\n\nSo instead of kowtowing to the GOP establishment by, say, ruling out a third-party run for the White House, and jeopardizing his hard-earned brand as an in-your-face populist truth-teller in the process, Trump could match or even surpass the share of the popular vote Ross Perot won in 1992 by embracing a potent mix of right-wing and left-wing policy prescriptions.\n\nWhat might full-spectrum Trumpism look like?

For a while there, all we seemed to be talking about was the way in which women would not be talked down to again.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate.\n\nA series of remarkable gaffes by various GOP politicians that evinced a lack of concern about basic women\u2019s health issues aided and abetted that effort. The various stupidisms of the 2012 campaign ranged from the assertion by Missouri Rep. Todd Akin that \"if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down,\" to Indiana Senate candidate Richard Mourdock's fervent belief that pregnancy from \"rape ... is something that God intended to happen.\" Wisconsin state Rep. Roger Rivard thoughtfully opined that \"some girls rape easy,\" and Mitt Romney's infamous claim that he was in possession of \"binders full of women\" probably became the single most notorious episode, because it signified what a gender gaffe truly is: an inadvertent blurting out of a statement you secretly believe to be wholly true.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe attendant outcry from those gaffes led to some significant spinning and walking back, and the system seemed to finally be in perfect equipoise: GOP men said dopey things about women, women punched back, and GOP men retreated to their man caves of bewilderment to await 2016.\n\nYet the ostensible lessons of 2012 seem to have been completely subverted in one brief summer that has returned us all to the Gidget era. The genius of Donald Trump\u2019s run for the White House is that he has almost single-handedly upended the national gender stupidity/umbrage continuum. We have, seemingly without warning, reached the point in time at which when Trump says something hateful and misogynistic, nobody evinces any surprise, he declines to apologize, and nothing changes in the polls.\n\nThis new dynamic has stupefied Trump\u2019s critics on the left, with the Onion putting it all pretty bluntly in a headline that reads: \u201cFemale Trump Supporters Just Feel More Comfortable With GOP Candidate Who\u2019s Openly Horrible to Them.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Aliyah Frumin pondered openly why GOP women aren\u2019t turned off by Trump\u2019s deliberate anti-woman comments\u2014including his ongoing feud with Fox News Megyn Kelly (he retweeted a claim that she\u2019s a bimbo and says she is bad at her job because she asks questions during debates). Yet this Zogby poll from late July shows Trump with a huge lead among women over his closest GOP rival, Jeb Bush. A Gallup poll taken after the debates showed his support among women increased from 29 to 30 following the altercation with Kelly.* Wondering why his statements aren\u2019t significantly eroding his popularity with Republican women voters, Frumin puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s all a bit baffling. Not only does Trump say sexist things, but his invariably macho stance on everything from foreign policy to immigration is the sort of testosterone-fueled bravado that typically rubs many female voters the wrong way. But with Trump, apparently, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nI confess to be equally baffled by the meh-reaction by GOP women to Trump\u2019s decades of Pretty Woman\u2013style musings on gender, including global statements about women being manipulative craven vixens who outsmart men largely by way of their extremely large boobs. (One tiny gem, from his 1997 book The Art of the Comeback: \u201cWomen have one of the great acts of all time. The smart ones act very feminine and needy, but inside they are real killers. The person who came up with the expression \u2018the weaker sex\u2019 was either very naive or had to be kidding. I have seen women manipulate men with just a twitch of their eye \u2014 or perhaps another body part.\u201d)\n\nOf late, poor Lindsey Graham has been reduced to sputtering that \u201cthe way he attacks women is going to be a death blow to the future of our party,\u201d as he sags further and further behind Trump in the polls. Perhaps Trump\u2019s greatest gift, as a steaming misogynist, is that he is basically always the drunk guy in the bar slurring \u201cnice tits.\u201d Serious women don\u2019t take him seriously, and everyone else just thinks he\u2019s deranged. Worse, he is the unrepentant drunk in the bar; he\u2019s not sorry for calling women pigs or gold-diggers. Unlike the Romneys or the Mourdocks, he doesn\u2019t let himself get \u201cbullied\u201d by politically correct women. He just sends them mail telling them they\u2019re ugly.\n\nPart of what Trump is cashing in on is your standard umbrage fatigue. The year of the woman in 2012 was totally bracing for a blowback. Michelle Letner, who donated $225 to Trump, told MSNBC\u2019s Frumin, \u201cI like that he\u2019s not politically correct. \u2026 He\u2019s saying it like it is. If you want to be treated like a lady, act like a lady.\u201d Or, as Amanda Marcotte explains here, trashing women and defending that as a refreshing tonic to political correctness is a way of life in some conservative circles.\n\nOne other line of thought suggests that since Trump\u2019s putative opponent this year is Hillary Clinton, his gloves-off attitude toward gender may actually help him. One recent focus group, treated to details of Trump attacking Rosie O\u2019Donnell as a fat pig, liked him more afterward than they did before. This, goes the theory, is how to take down a woman who keeps banging on and on and on about women.\n\nOr maybe since Trump still reads a bit like a joke, it\u2019s still easy to dismiss his whole women-as-lamb chops worldview as a joke, too. On the bright side, things will change in the coming months, and we can all look back at Trump\u2019s run for the presidency and remember that both he and we got what we wanted out of it: good burlesque. As Trump famously said in a 1991 Esquire interview, \u201cYou know, it doesn\u2019t really matter what [the media] write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\u201d One thing we can know for sure, Trump will not be changed by his little tango with destiny.

But there\u2019s reason to be suspicious of the way drug lords use stories to cement their political power and historical importance. If watching political candidates relentlessly underscore their humble beginnings can teach us anything, it\u2019s that all politics, the legitimate and the seedy, are as reliant on the myths of the self-made man as they are on actual policy. Narcos, which premiers on Netflix on Friday, dramatizes the relationship between myth and politics. The series is set during the 1980s Colombian drug war, but it\u2019s more generally about the myths that drug lords, politicians, and cops tell the communities they serve.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNarcos, directed by Jos\u00e9 Padilha, follows the rise of Colombia\u2019s Medellin drug cartel, which gains unprecedented power with Pablo Escobar (Wagner Moura) at the helm. On Escobar\u2019s heels are DEA agents Javier Pe\u00f1a (Pedro Pascal) and Steve Murphy (Boyd Holbrook), who is the gravelly-voiced narrator of the series, hardened by years of disillusionment. For viewers, he connects what seem like disparate events into a complex network of cause and effect. But his poetic, soaring narration also suggests that Murphy might be bending reality to fit the framework of a good story.\n\nNarcos defines its story as a \u201cmagical realist\u201d one, blurring borders between the fantastic and the harrowingly real. Themes of luck and fate are juxtaposed with the very entrenched structural failures of government and law enforcement. The cinematography contrasts striking views of Colombia\u2019s lush landscape with images of bloody bodies strewn in the street. Reality constantly disrupts fiction, as archival footage and photos are woven, often jarringly, through the plot.\n\nBut what Narcos might call magical realism is actually an old storytelling tradition: \u201cnarco cinema,\u201d a Latin American genre comprised entirely of B-movies about the drug trade. Narco cinema hinges on a deep romanticization of the power and violence of drug lords. It turns cops into villains, drug lords into heroes, and beauty queens into narcos. Underneath all the excessive violence and sex, though, it deftly exposes the weaknesses and corruption of government systems. In the movies La Banda del Carro Rojo (The Red Car Gang) and Salvando Privado P\u00e9rez (Saving Private P\u00e9rez), getting involved in the drug trade allows men to acquire the economic resources and manpower necessary to escape poverty and certain death. Films like Lo Negro del Negro (The Black of Blackie) and La Reina del Pac\u00edfico (The Queen of the Pacific) illustrate how the rise of drug kingpins like Arturo Durazo and Sandra \u00c1vila is a direct consequence of inept law enforcement.\n\nNarco cinema is so valuable because\u2014by sneaking nightmarish images of violence into dazzling displays of wealth and power\u2014it has become a crucial site of transgression and critique in a country where the stakes of speaking out against the cartels are high. By glorifying the cartels just enough to flatter them, narco cinema is the rare safe space where the complex relations between Latin American citizens and the drug cartels can be negotiated publicly.\n\nAmerican narco films, on the other hand, tend to heavily privilege myth and drama over realism. Steven Soderbergh\u2019s Traffic prioritizes the domestic melodramas of Wakefield, whose daughter is an addict, and Helena Ayala (Catherine Zeta-Jones), the pregnant wife of an American narcotrafficker, while ignoring the larger political implications of the drug war. As newly appointed drug czar Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas), says, maybe fixing the problem just requires \u201cthinking outside the box.\u201d In the end, the film suggests that the biggest threat the drug war poses may be to the American nuclear family.\n\nNarcos\u2019 Escobar offers a striking contrast to the Escobar of Pablo Escobar: Paradise Lost, in which Benicio del Toro plays the eponymous drug lord. In that movie, through the eyes of the na\u00efve Nick, played by Josh Hutcherson (who has fallen in love with Escobar\u2019s niece, Maria), Escobar is a master myth-maker\u2014an unknowable, unpredictable, and alluring man. But the movie fails to capture the realism of the drug war, even in moments when Escobar\u2019s magical charisma gives way to his brutal side. Because Nick seems unaware of any socio-political context for Escobar\u2019s violence, the film\u2019s pivotal action sequence, in which Escobar\u2019s hitmen kill a handful of innocent people, plays like a one-off surreal dream instead of the kind of daily occurrence regularly witnessed by communities in the midst of the drug war.\n\nNarcos is the first production in the true narco-cinematic vein to come to American screens. Unlike most American movies about the drug trade, it manages to glamorize its protagonists while still revealing the devastating structural problems they are working within. It understands a key dynamic in our real drug wars: the way drug lords and the cops and the DEA agents are all involved in the project of creating and fortifying the powerful myths around them, and they will do whatever it takes to secure their legacy. In the show, the DEA, as well as Escobar, are shown bowing to economic pressures and making unwanted compromises with government officials, all the while fancying themselves heroes and vigilantes.\n\nIn his narration, Murphy seems especially intrigued with exploring this conflation of \u201cdreams and reality\u201d in his storytelling. He explains Escobar\u2019s lofty political aspirations\u2014to become a congressman\u2014as an inevitable byproduct of his meteoric rise out of poverty. (\u201cImagine you were born in a poor family, in a poor city, in a poor country and by the time you were 28 years old you had so much money you can\u2019t even count it. What do you do? You make your dreams come true.\u201d) Murphy cannot help but use the language of mythology to ominously foretell Escobar\u2019s fate, comparing him to Icarus trying to fly too close to the sun. In the end, he warns: \u201cEven magical realism has its limits.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:32:18.765+0000"}

It\u2019s politically risky for Israel\u2019s head of state to go up against the president of his only big ally and benefactor; it\u2019s catastrophic to do so and come away with nothing. Similarly, it\u2019s a huge defeat for AIPAC, whose power derives from an image of invincibility. American politicians and donors might get the idea that the group isn\u2019t so invincible after all, that they can defy its wishes, now and then, without great risk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt would have been better for Netanyahu\u2014and for Israel\u2014had he maybe grumbled about the Iran deal but not opposed it outright, let alone so brazenly. He could have pried many more favors from Obama in exchange for his scowl-faced neutrality. Not that Obama, or any other American president, will cut Israel off; but relations will remain more strained, and requests for other favors (for more or bigger weapons, or for certain votes in international forums) will be scrutinized more warily, than they would have been.\n\nIf the House and Senate do vote down the deal next month, Obama will impose a veto. To override the veto, his opponents would need to muster a two-thirds majority in both chambers of Congress. As even many of these opponents admit, they are unlikely to do so. There is even a fair chance that they\u2019ll fall short of the 60 votes needed to block the threat of a Democratic filibuster.\n\nSomething interesting has happened the past few weeks. Many lawmakers have read the 159-page deal, known as the \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action,\u201d signed by Iran and the P5+1 nations (the United States, Great Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany). Many more have been briefed on the deal\u2019s fine points by the American negotiators and technical specialists, as well as by Western ambassadors. And many of them\u2014those who aren\u2019t bound by GOP discipline or constituents\u2019 pressure (and even a few who are)\u2014have concluded that this is a good deal.\n\nMost criticisms of the deal actually have nothing to do with the deal. They concern the Iranian regime\u2019s potential threat to Israel, its support of terrorist groups, its expansionist ambitions in the region, its record of duplicity, and its oppressive policies toward its own people. All these concerns are valid, but they\u2019re also irrelevant. Critics (in some cases the same critics) inveighed against 30 years of Soviet-American arms control accords for similar reasons, having less to do with the text of any treaty than with the brutal, aggressive nature of the Communist regime in the Kremlin. Still, those accords capped the deadliest of the era\u2019s dangers and created diplomatic forums that eventually helped foster the end of the Cold War.\n\nTo the extent the Iran nuclear deal has any impact on concerns about the mullahs\u2019 regime, it should be, for the most part, beneficial. Slashing Iran\u2019s nuclear program (which the deal clearly does) reduces the threat to Israel; opening its facilities to international inspectors (which the deal does to an extent unmatched by any previous arms agreements) makes its activities more transparent, harder to hide.\n\nAnother widespread criticism is that Obama and the P5+1 partners were \u201cfleeced\u201d or \u201cbamboozled\u201d by the Iranians. Or, as former Defense Secretary Robert Gates put it, \u201cOur negotiators got out-negotiated.\u201d Gates has nonetheless urged that Congress approve the deal, saying, \u201cI think we swallow hard, acknowledge \u2026 that we have a flawed deal, and make the best of it.\u201d\n\nBut is it so \u201cflawed\u201d? Did Secretary of State John Kerry and his team of diplomats and nuclear scientists get \u201cout-negotiated\u201d? Gates didn\u2019t cite specifics, but other critics have noted disparities between the Obama administration\u2019s demands as the talks got under way and the actual deal it wound up signing.\n\nFirst, this is a shallow criterion for assessing any negotiated deal. Sometimes opening positions are just that\u2014tactical ploys, bargaining chips. Sometimes concessions are made in exchange for concessions from the other side. (Rarely, except after military surrender, does one side get everything it wants in negotiations.) Sometimes new facts emerge that make an earlier demand less important.\n\nBut second, let\u2019s look at the issues on which the P5+1 nations supposedly caved to Iran. Early in the talks, the Obama administration demanded that Iran halt the enrichment of uranium; Iranian officials insisted on their nation\u2019s \u201cinalienable right\u201d to enrich uranium. Two things happened as the talks progressed. It became clear that not even the most reform-minded Iranian politician would accept a deal that scrapped the enrichment program. And it became clear that the Iranians had a point. Article IV of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\u2014signed by 190 nations, including Iran\u2014acknowledges \u201cthe inalienable right of all the Parties to the Treaty to develop research, production, and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without discrimination.\u201d The NPT does not specify the right to enrich uranium as an \u201cinalienable\u201d path to produce nuclear energy, but it doesn\u2019t preclude that path either. Meanwhile, the deal forces the Iranians to destroy all the uranium that they\u2019ve enriched beyond the level of 3.67 percent (weapons-grade uranium is 90 percent enriched); it limits all future enrichment to 3.5 percent; it cuts their stockpile of uranium by 90 percent, to 300 kilograms (not enough to build a single bomb, even if further enriched); and it slashes their stockpile of centrifuges\u2014the spinning paddles that enrich uranium gas\u2014by two-thirds.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:32:19.632+0000"}

{"entityId": 121, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn March 2011, economists Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun Park, and Kwanho Shin released a working paper titled \u201cWhen Fast Growing Economies Slow Down: International Evidence and Implications for China.\u201d The paper focused on the rapid growth of large emerging markets in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, and in particular, the double-digit growth coming out of China. Then it asked: When might China\u2019s economic engine slow down? Here\u2019s what they found:\n\nThe evidence suggests that rapidly growing economies slow down significantly, in the sense that the growth rate downshifts by at least 2 percentage points, when their per capita incomes reach around $17,000 US in year-2005 constant international prices, a level that China should achieve by or soon after 2015.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s from the abstract of the paper, which was tweeted out over the weekend by Wonkblog\u2019s Matt O\u2019Brien. And after the past few weeks of China\u2019s currency devaluation, bad economic data, and stock market turbulence, it\u2019s looking more and more prescient. In their paper, the economists looked at historical instances of slowdowns from around the world. They found that slowdowns were most strongly associated with a drop in total factor productivity growth from 3-plus percent to nearly zero. Slowdowns, they wrote, \u201ccoincide with the point in the growth process where it is no longer possible to boost productivity by shifting additional workers from agriculture to industry and where the gains from importing foreign technology diminish.\u201d As noted in the paper\u2019s abstract, slowdowns also tended to occur when per capita incomes (in 2005 prices) climbed to around $17,000 and when manufacturing accounted for around 23 percent of total employment. Countries with greater dependency on aging populations and with \u201cdramatically undervalued currencies\u201d were also more likely to experience slowdowns.\n\nEarlier this week, I called up Eichengreen to see whether he thought the forecasts made in his 2011 paper held. \u201cThey fit the China we\u2019re seeing today,\u201d he told me. \u201cI think we are seeing two separate things. The growth of the economy has slowed from 10 percent a few years ago to somewhere in the 6 to 7 percent range, and that\u2019s what we talk about in the paper. And then there\u2019s a second, largely separate phenomenon where the stock market more than doubled since between last December and the beginning of the summer, and now it\u2019s given back about half of what it gained, and you know all kinds of people are nonplussed, all kinds of small investors and local investors and others took steps on the stock market. They were encouraged to do so by authorities to juice the economy a bit. But now those efforts have unraveled.\u201d\n\nIn their paper, Eichengreen and his colleagues predict that China\u2019s economy will grow by 6.1 to 7.0 percent annually in the current decade, and then by 5 to 6.2 percent in the following. While those projections largely tracked with previous research, some 2010 work from the Conference Board was grimmer\u2014suggesting China\u2019s growth could decelerate to 6.1 percent and then to 3.9 percent by 2020. As core segments of the Chinese economy like consumer spending, construction, and financial services have swooned recently, worries about what kind of sluggishness the government\u2019s official numbers might be hiding have increased dramatically.

It was his decision to let West\u2019s speech\u2014which fluctuated between thoughtful commentary and nervous rambling\u2014run until the infamous Bush line, at which point he cut to the next performer, Chris Tucker, whose own split-second stumble and roving eyes only reinforced the awkwardness of the scene. At the time, an NBC spokesperson explained that the network didn\u2019t use the seven-second tape delay to cut West off because the person in charge \"was instructed to listen for a curse word, and didn't realize (West) had gone off-script.\u201d That wasn\u2019t true, according to Kaplan, who said he waited for an appropriate pause in Kanye\u2019s speech to try to move the program to the next scheduled segment. \u201cI\u2019m in the control room and I\u2019m running the show, and I\u2019m sitting there going, \u2018I don\u2019t know how to cut this off,\u2019 \u201d Kaplan said of the transition. While the cut was certainly jarring and looked at the time like it was prompted directly by the provocativeness of the Bush remark, Kaplan insists that he was just looking for a natural out in an extremely unusual situation.\n\n\u201cThere was never a thought that we were going to just cut him off,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was an extraordinary moment, and however ugly it might turn out to be, you don\u2019t need to make it uglier.\u201d\n\n\u201cUltimately, it isn\u2019t necessarily an ugly moment, it\u2019s an honest moment,\u201d Kaplan added.\n\nAfter it was over, Kaplan remembers Myers walking up to him and saying, in the style of Dr. Evil, \u201cWell that went well, didn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nMatt Lauer quickly wrote a closing speech to put Kanye\u2019s remarks in perspective, saying \"emotions in this country right now are running very high. Sometimes that emotion is translated into inspiration, sometimes into criticism,\" before the show ended with Harry Connick Jr. leading the celebrity cast in a rendition of \"When the Saints Go Marching In.\"\n\nKaplan says he was in \u201cshell-shock\u201d after the show, and West was nowhere to be found. But he says a trio of the show\u2019s musical performers\u2014Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, and Harry Connick Jr.\u2014took him aside and said, \u201cI know that you\u2019re feeling like it all got screwed up because of Kanye.

{"entityId": 126, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "That many places put six times that amount on one bagel is more than a culinary faux pas; it\u2019s an economic mystery. Cream cheese is hardly the only example of outsize portions in American restaurants, but it\u2019s unique in that it actually makes the meal less delicious. I know I don\u2019t need all the chips I\u2019m served at a Mexican place, but I want them; only an act of willpower will keep me from eating them. I\u2019ll pick some pastrami off a Jewish deli sandwich so I can fit the thing in my mouth, but I\u2019ll polish it off once the bread is gone. Cream cheese is different. I can\u2019t think of any other food that is routinely served in portions that people actually dislike. Given the notoriously low margins of the restaurant industry, why would businesses regularly give away extra product that customers don\u2019t want\u2014that, indeed, they scrape off like barnacles?\n\nCream cheese is a spread, not a sandwich filling. This wisdom is so deeply ingrained in American Jewish culture, to which we owe the bagel, that there\u2019s a Yiddish term for the proper portion: schmear. The word itself evokes restraint, its rough schm- sound reminiscent of the knife\u2019s halting scrape. (Compare it with, say, slather, whose pliant consonants evoke a smoothly spread dollop of sunscreen.) Or as Marc Fintz, business development director of Davidovich Bakery in Queens and a fellow cream cheese curmudgeon, put it in an email: \u201cA cream cheese portion should be a shmear. It should be enough to bring out the delicious taste of a traditionally cured bagel. It is a complement to the taste\u2014NOT THE TASTE!\u201d Fintz recommends a modest half-ounce of cream cheese for a bagel with lox, and perhaps up to three-quarters of an ounce without lox.\n\nMy concern here is not really health, though at 100 calories per ounce, all that cream cheese can\u2019t be good for you. It\u2019s taste. A good New York bagel doesn\u2019t need 3 ounces of cream cheese any more than it needs 3 ounces of butter.\n\nJust how much are we talking about? Employees at a few Manhattan shops told me they add a quarter-pound, which is insane. A representative of Ess-a-Bagel, the East Side institution, said staff there are told to give about 3 ounces\u2014only slightly less insane. In an article for Serious Eats last year, Max Falkowitz weighed samples from six New York City stores and found a range from 0.7 ounces, at Black Seed in Brooklyn, to 3.9 ounces, at Brooklyn Bagel in Manhattan. Absolute Bagel came in at 2.5 ounces, and Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s favorite , Bagel Hole, served 1.7 ounces. Even those mid-range numbers are a lot. I ordered an everything bagel with \u201cjust a little cream cheese\u201d at Bagel Hole a few weeks ago, and still had to tell the guy to scrape some off.\n\nI\u2019ve puzzled over this ever since I moved to Manhattan 10 years ago for college. Weekend afternoons often found me on a bench outside the Upper West Side stalwart Absolute Bagels, awkwardly cupping my bagel in the wax paper it was served in, trying not to drop it while I scraped away globs of excess cream cheese. For a long time, I wasn\u2019t sure if others went through the same annoying ritual, so I recently started asking around. I\u2019ve brought it up with friends, neighbors, and strangers at bars. I\u2019ve asked young black women and old Jewish men. While my methods are far from scientific, my research strongly suggests that most New Yorkers agree: The cream cheese is too damn much.\n\nWait, no. That last part is gross. And yet it\u2019s sadly typical. New York bagel places are giving us way too much cream cheese, and it makes no sense.\n\nThere\u2019s nothing quite like a good New York bagel with cream cheese. First, you bite through the crisp outer crust; then you move on to the chewy, bubbly crumb; and finally, of course, everything is overpowered by an enormous mouthful of cold white goop.\n\n\u201cYou want customers to feel like they\u2019re getting their money\u2019s worth,\u201d said Alyse Jacobson, a representative of Ess-a-Bagel. \u201cThey could always scrape it off, but once you leave here, you\u2019ve got what you\u2019ve got. Yes, that\u2019s wasteful and that\u2019s unfortunate, but we\u2019d rather customers think, \u2018I\u2019ve gotten too much\u2019 than say, \u2018I\u2019ve gotten skimped.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFintz had a more cynical explanation: The excess spread is there to \u201cjustify the upcharge\u201d of a bagel with cream cheese\u2014typically about a dollar more than a bagel by itself.\n\nIn fact, \u201cjustifying the upcharge\u201d and \u201cgetting your money\u2019s worth\u201d are two spins on the same idea: The mountain of cream cheese is intended to make the price seem reasonable. But is it really true that New Yorkers would balk at paying a dollar for just a schmear, if that\u2019s what they prefer? Everyone knows restaurants overcharge for fixings\u2014no one thinks lettuce and tomato really cost 75 cents. Personally, I would rather pay the same price for the amount I want and skip the hassle of the scrape-off. And since bagel places seem to be serving many multiples more than customers want, they could preserve their profit margins by charging a little less for a lot less cream cheese. Let the minority who are happy with the status quo ask for extra.\n\nOne thing I learned in my research is that there\u2019s a massive disconnect between buyers and sellers. Bagel purveyors generally seemed flabbergasted by the idea that the average customer might prefer less cream cheese. \u201cYou want more cream cheese?\u201d said one Israeli bagel-shop manager, after I asked him over the phone why his store insisted on giving me too much. \u201cI\u2019ll give you more cream cheese. You just have to ask.\u201d Then he hung up.\n\nJacobson, at Ess-a-Bagel, acknowledged that some people prefer less cream cheese, but was skeptical that they were in the majority. \u201cIf we got feedback from our customers that they\u2019re not happy, they\u2019d like a little less cream cheese, then obviously we\u2019re going to listen to our consumers,\u201d she said. \u201cBut so far that\u2019s not the kind of feedback we\u2019re getting.\u201d\n\nIn other words, New Yorkers may think they\u2019re getting too much cream cheese, but the message isn\u2019t getting through. Why? How hard is it to ask for less?\n\nKind of hard, actually. For one thing, it doesn\u2019t always do the trick. Because the default portion is so huge, I still end up scraping some off\u2014so why bother? And in the harried environment of a bagel shop, where the employees are busy and often not native English speakers, the fine details of one\u2019s order often seem unlikely to make it to whoever is actually preparing the bagel.\n\nBut the biggest barrier is psychological. The other day I was talking about the cream cheese glut with a friend who works as a waitress. \u201cYou\u2019ve never worked in the service industry, have you?\u201d she asked. To her it was obvious why servers would give so much cream cheese: They hate having to deal with customers who come back asking for more.\n\nMy friend\u2019s point was that I must not have considered how annoying special requests are to servers. In fact, the exact opposite is true. Like most (though not all) New Yorkers, I\u2019ve internalized service employees\u2019 contempt for nonstandard orders. Despite their reputation for brashness, what New Yorkers really pride themselves on is frictionless navigation of the city\u2019s mad intensity. And asking for less is still a special request. Even the three seconds it takes to say \u201cseriously, just a really little bit of cream cheese\u201d feels like enough time to incur the annoyance of the staff and the people in line behind you.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:32:44.844+0000"}

During a news conference, Ramos stood and peppered Trump with questions on his immigration plan, which calls for mass deportation. Trump dismissed him\u2014\u201cGo back to Univision\u201d\u2014and a guard for the candidate removed him from the room. Ramos eventually came back to the room, where Trump took his questions.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nThe whole exchange was dramatic, riveting TV\u2014illustrative of Trump\u2019s aggressive disdain for journalists, and a notch against him for the millions of Hispanic Americans who watch and respect Ramos, sometimes called the \u201cWalter Cronkite of Latino America.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe most interesting moment of the news conference came a little later, however, when Trump was talking about money, and fundraising in particular. Here\u2019s what he said:\n\nI mean, part of my thing is, frankly, I\u2019m not controlled by anybody. These other people are raising hundreds of millions of dollars. I could do that easily. I don\u2019t want to do that. It\u2019s not necessary for me to do that.\n\nLater, when asked about special interests and the Republican Party, he built on that point:\n\nA lobbyist, a person, very good person, came to me, offered $5 million, \u2018please, I want to give you $5 million for the campaign.\u2019 I said I have no interest in taking that. In fact, it\u2019s the first time I think he\u2019s ever been turned down. [\u2026]\n\nHe\u2019ll be coming to me and he\u2019ll be saying in two years, in one year, in four years, he\u2019ll be representing a country, maybe a company or maybe a person\u2014I\u2019m not doing anything for him.\n\nAll of this fits with earlier rhetoric; in early August, Trump needled his GOP rivals with this tweet: \u201cI wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers. Puppets?\u201d Whether he knows it or not, this anti-lobbying oratory is a potent message\u2014the kind of rhetoric that could bridge his appeal to the mainstream.\n\nIn an analysis for the Democratic Strategist and the Washington Monthly published earlier this year, pollster Stan Greenberg drew a connection between the high-dollar fundraising of modern political campaigns and the deep government distrust from working-class whites, working-class white men in particular: \u201cWhile white working-class women are more likely to see campaign contributors and party leaders as having the most influence, white working-class men again cite special interest groups and lobbyists: amazingly, 60 percent say these groups hold the cards in Washington.\u201d\n\nFor Greenberg, it\u2019s this\u2014more than anything else in politics\u2014that fuels anti-government cynicism. These voters agree with progressive economic principles, he notes, but \u201ceverything they have seen says that government is gridlocked and is bought and paid for by big donors and special interests, and politicians rig the system for the most irresponsible companies.\u201d They want government to work in their favor, but they don\u2019t trust that it will. Instead, they assume that government will take their taxes and spend it on \u201cindividuals and corporations vastly more wealthy and powerful than themselves.\u201d\n\nHis solution, as a Democratic pollster, is an explicit reform agenda: for Democrats to loudly commit to policies that curtail lobbying, take money out of politics, and shrink influence from special interests. If pulled off, Democrats could win working-class whites\u2014or at least a larger portion of them\u2014and secure their advantage in national elections.\n\nTrump\u2019s core appeal is nativism; more than anything else, Trump voters are against immigration. But if Trump persists through the year and into the primaries\u2014and if he survives past Iowa and New Hampshire\u2014then he\u2019ll need a broader message than anger against unauthorized immigrants.\n\nThere\u2019s almost no chance that Trump or his team has read Greenberg. But if Greenberg is right\u2014and millions of Americans are open to an explicit message against the wealthy donors and fundraisers that dominate American politics\u2014then Trump\u2019s message of financial independence could be his key to a broader constituency.\n\nPublic opinion bears this out. According to a June poll from CBS News and the New York Times, 84 percent of Americans say money has \u201ctoo much influence\u201d in American elections. And 39 percent want \u201cfundamental\u201d changes in our system for funding political campaigns, while 46 percent say it needs complete rebuilding. Republicans terrified of a third-party Trump candidacy should consider this, as well: 58 percent of Americans say that both parties benefit equally from the vast amount of money in political campaigns.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:32:52.152+0000"}

The GOP frontrunner\u2019s campaign runs on politically incorrect anger and anti-immigrant hostility. What better way, then, to add some fuel to the fire than by booting a respected Hispanic reporter from the room and sending him on his way with a go back to-constructed taunt that would make a more modest candidate cringe?\n\nIt\u2019s not as though Trump is risking anything with the stunt. He had previously filed a $500-million lawsuit against Univision over the network\u2019s decision to cut ties with his Miss USA pageant. His standing with Hispanic voters, meanwhile, can\u2019t sink much lower\u2014his \u201cHispanics love me\u201d claims notwithstanding. According to the latest Gallup numbers, the businessman boasts a stunning net-favorability rating of negative-51 percent, more than seven times worse than the ratings of his closest GOP rivals. When you\u2019re proposing to deport 11 million undocumented immigrants\u2014and when you launch your campaign with a rambling rant suggesting many Mexican immigrants are rapists and murderers\u2014ejecting a Hispanic journalist from a news conference hardly seems out of character, even if that journalist is the Walter Cronkite of Latino America.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision this week to restart his fight with Fox News, though, was much more surprising given the network\u2019s nativist tilt and conservative audience are widely considered to have helped him rise to the top of a crowded Republican field in the first place. After Fox News and Trump struck a temporary truce following his post-debate tantrum, the general consensus was that not even Donald Trump had the firepower to win a prolonged fight with the cable news giant. As Ezra Klein put it in Vox, \u201cDonald Trump needs Fox News more than Fox News needs Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nApparently, Trump does not care. And maybe he\u2019s right not to: If the grilling he received from Fox News in Cleveland hurt Trump, it\u2019s hard to see that in the polls. Ailes, meanwhile, reportedly sought to make peace once the early returns from the debate suggested that many of his network\u2019s viewers were on Trump\u2019s side\u2014and because he feared Trump might boycott the network if the fight escalated any further. It\u2019s clear that regardless of how much Fox needs Trump, it clearly wants him.\n\nThe billionaire\u2019s recent bluster, meanwhile, suggests that he believes his campaign has reached escape velocity and that he no longer needs to rely on visits to Fox & Friends to get his message out. Maybe that\u2019s because, according to one recent count, Trump has received more combined coverage on the NBC, ABC, and CBS nightly newscasts than all 16 of his GOP rivals combined since the first primary debate\u2014and nearly four times the coverage of the second-most covered Republican, Jeb Bush. In case the media\u2019s appetite for all things Trump was still in doubt, CNN made it clear on Tuesday when the network bumped Anderson Cooper\u2019s previously scheduled Hurricane Katrina anniversary special in favor of wall-to-wall coverage of Trump\u2019s Iowa rally. No one else in the field has proved capable of stopping a news cycle in its tracks simply by opening his mouth.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear exactly how much Trump risks losing if Fox News turns against him. It may be the cable channel of choice for many Republicans, but we shouldn\u2019t overstate its importance. As Politico Magazine\u2019s Jack Shafer has repeatedly pointed out, Fox is much better at employing presidential candidates than getting one elected. Consider: According to Pew research from 2012, a majority of the Fox News audience doesn\u2019t even identify themselves as Republican. And while it trounces its cable rivals when it comes to ratings, its reach is relatively limited compared to network TV. Fox News\u2019 most popular program, The O\u2019Reilly Factor, pulls in a little more than 3 million viewers on its best night. For comparison, the most recent season of the Trump-hosted Celebrity Apprentice on NBC averaged more than 6 million viewers per episode. (Meanwhile, both numbers represent but a sliver of the more than 230 million Americans who are eligible to vote.)\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear exactly what Fox News can do to convince Trump supporters to change their minds even the network does launch a full-on assault on the Republican frontrunner. GOP pollster Frank Luntz\u2014not a Trump fan\u2014held a recent focus group of Trump supporters in an effort to make sense of a phenomenon that has so far refused to obey the usual rules of electoral politics.

The photos may be shared, however, to document a problem or malfunction with voting system. Indiana is hardly the first state to adopt such a law. White\u2019s beloved Maine amended its code in 2011 to remove a pre-existing (pre\u2013selfie heyday!) ban on sharing of photos of one\u2019s ballot. Research by the Digital Media Law Project indicates that while only a handful of states explicitly ban recordings inside the polling place, there are actually plenty of laws on the books that, if fully enforced, would stifle ballot selfie expression. And until recently, New Hampshire voters were also bound by a law that left them free to live, but not to post. Earlier this month, the U.S. District Court in New Hampshire overturned the law on the grounds that it amounted to a content-based restriction on speech, giving Kardashian lovers everywhere reason to celebrate and bow down to the altar of the \u201cgram.\u201d\n\nIn 2014, New Hampshire updated a decades-old election law to extend the general ban on a voter sharing her marked ballot to specifically prohibit social distribution. The rationale? Selfies and the information they contain could lead to coercion and vote buying. Boss Tweed political-machine types and corporate overlords with a cause, the argument goes, will demand voting booth selfies as proof that smartphone-wielding employees are toeing the party and company line.

Do you mind if I take leave while this happens?\u201d I said, \u201cSure, it\u2019s your prerogative.\u201d He walked out of my office, filled out the paperwork, gave it to me, and I approved.\n\nThen he said I fired him.\n\nBut he was scheduled to leave the position already.\n\nYes. When I first met Monk, he told me, \u201cI\u2019m getting ready to leave, and I don\u2019t want to get too involved with the squadron.\u201d He was slated to rotate out.\n\nHow quickly did Monk take his story public?\n\nThe Wednesday after he went on leave, I was at a restaurant, and my major called me. \u201cHave you seen Fox News?\u201d he asked. And there was Monk, on Fox News, talking about how I fired him over religious freedom.\n\nThen he went to the Liberty Counsel, and they changed it completely. They said I\u2019m a lesbian, and I had an agenda. Monk went on this crusade against me. I\u2019m getting hate mail and death threats because of this.\n\nMy family, we are Christian as well. We bow our head to pray for dinner. We hold hands and we pray together. It blows my mind that people took Monk at his word. That\u2019s not a Christian thing to do\u2014bearing false witness to your neighbors.\n\nDid the Air Force believe Monk?\n\nThey launched an investigation and cleared me. They found him guilty of lying. But then they gave him a decoration because they didn\u2019t want to rock the boat. My commander did nothing to help me or protect me.\n\nHow did your commander react to all this?\n\nShe wasn\u2019t going to do anything to help me. At one point I went to her and said, I\u2019m getting physical hate mail to my home, emails to my government computer that are threatening my life. I asked if I could change my email address. She said, \u201cNo, you need to get a tougher skin.\u201d\n\nDo you think she was homophobic?\n\nPhoto courtesy of Liz Valenzuela\n\nWhen I took command of the squadron, and I told her I wanted to introduce my wife and children, she said, absolutely not. You cannot say that she\u2019s your wife. I said, we\u2019ve been married\u2014we have a certificate from the state of New York. She said, no, actually, you\u2019re not. I had to go to legal and fight her. Legal barely gave an inch and said, you can call her your \u201cpartner.\u201d\n\nWhen I wrote up my speech, my commander reviewed it and told me, \u201cIf you slip up and say she\u2019s your wife, you and I are gonna have a discussion afterward.\u201d I was just asking to say she was my spouse like anybody else would say. After that, my commander wouldn\u2019t let my spouse do anything with the squadron. She said it \u201cwouldn\u2019t look proper\u201d for my female spouse to be in the front and center.\n\nMy commander also refused to give me leave for my son\u2019s first day of school so I could explain to his teachers that he has a medical condition\u2014something I\u2019d done every year before. She denied me leave when my son had a medical emergency that required hospitalization. She was really unfair about my family.\n\nWhat do you make of Ted Cruz\u2019s fawning profile of Monk?\n\nI believe Ted Cruz believes Monk is telling the truth. He doesn\u2019t realize that Monk lied\u2014a lot. Hopefully, if Ted Cruz actually knew that Monk lied, he would not have used him.\n\nThat\u2019s the problem. Nobody knows the actual truth because I never got to say my side. Everybody kept saying, keep quiet. Let this blow over. I\u2019m getting death threats and hate mail, but nobody seems to care because Monk\u2019s in the spotlight crying on cue.\n\nYou were promoted to lieutenant colonel despite Monk\u2019s accusations. Was there any acrimony among Monk\u2019s supporters over your advancement?\n\nWhen I was promoted, I had such a huge turnout at my change of command. People I had served with way before came and told me, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re leaving! We loved you so much! You were the best commander ever!\u201d I got so many accolades and warm wishes.\n\nI don\u2019t mean to toot my own horn. But I\u2019m gay and married to a woman, and I thought people would shy away from me. But they didn\u2019t. They were very excited and happy once they realized I didn\u2019t have an agenda. It\u2019s not a matter of being gay or straight. It\u2019s a matter of being a leader.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:33:24.119+0000"}

He doesn\u2019t just govern a blue state\u2014a win in its own right\u2014he\u2019s transformed it, making Wisconsin a vanguard for conservative causes, from right-to-work laws and public education cuts, to voter ID and strict limits on abortion. He\u2019s done all this with affirmation from Wisconsin voters; he beat a recall attempt in 2012 and won re-election in 2014. Even better, at least for his national ambitions, is his affect. He\u2019s not a firebrand and he doesn\u2019t alienate ordinary Americans. Instead, he looks and sounds like a middle manager; an ordinary, almost boring guy who just wants to save you money.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nWalker, put simply, appears tailor-made for a Republican presidential primary\u2014an ideal blend of mainstream experience and conservative politics. But in his months as a presidential candidate, Walker hasn\u2019t been the dark horse we expected\u2014the strongest challenger to Jeb Bush\u2019s dynastic candidacy. He\u2019s been, instead, a non-presence. He doesn\u2019t flicker, let alone catch fire, and when it comes to issues and answering voters, the Wisconsin governor has been awkward, clumsy, and flat-footed. Yes, he has money and yes, he has an organization. But that doesn\u2019t make up for skill, or a lack thereof. So far, he just isn\u2019t good, and it shows.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTake immigration. For all of his nativism and prejudice, Donald Trump has put things in sharp relief, and forced opponents to clarify their beliefs and articulate their stances on the issue. Bush, Marco Rubio, and John Kasich\u2014Walker\u2019s main rivals\u2014have stepped up to the challenge, with conservative positions that still have space to the right, and room to the left, should they get to the general election. Rubio, as we saw during the first Republican presidential debate, won\u2019t take Trump\u2019s anti-immigrant bait. He also consistently backs birthright citizenship, a provision of the 14th Amendment that grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States.\n\nKasich, likewise, has stuck to his plan: The \u201c11 or 12 million who are here, we ought to find out who they are,\u201d Kasich told CNN. \u201cIf they\u2019ve been law-abiding over a period of time, they ought to be legalized, and they ought to be able to stay here.\u201d What\u2019s more, he wants to complete a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border and establish a guest worker program, positions that can be sold to moderates and conservatives.\n\nBush has been a little muddled\u2014going as far as to defend the term anchor baby\u2014but his policy stance is clear: \u201cThere should be a path to earned legal status for those that are here\u2014not amnesty\u2014earned legal status, which means you pay a fine and do many things over an extended period of time,\u201d he said during the Republican debate.\n\nAs for Walker? Trump has him shook. On birthright citizenship, the Wisconsin governor has had three different answers. At the Iowa State Fair, he told MSNBC\u2019s Kasie Hunt that he wanted to curb the practice. \u201cTo me it\u2019s about enforcing the laws in this country. And I\u2019ve been very clear, I think you enforce the laws, and I think it\u2019s important to send a message that we\u2019re going to enforce the laws, no matter how people come here we\u2019re going to enforce the laws in this country,\u201d he said. The following Friday he told CNBC that he wouldn\u2019t take a stance on the issue. And this past Sunday, he told ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos that he doesn\u2019t want to repeal or alter the provision at all. It\u2019s clear, at this point, that he just doesn\u2019t know what to say.\n\nIn fairness to Walker, Trump overlaps with his base\u2014working-class and downscale whites. To a large degree, Walker has been shut out by Trump\u2019s rise; with Trump in the race, it\u2019s hard to get a hold with these voters, who prefer the flamboyant reality television star to the staid Midwestern politician.\n\nBut even without Trump, it's not clear that Walker could sail the rocky waters of a presidential campaign. At the GOP debate, for instance, he gave an answer on abortion that\u2014if he\u2019s the nominee\u2014could come back to haunt him. After moderator Megyn Kelly asked if he would \u201creally let a mother die rather than have an abortion,\u201d Walker dodged the question entirely. \u201cI\u2019ve got a position that\u2019s consistent with many Americans out there in that I believe that that is an unborn child that\u2019s in need of protection out there,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve said many times that that unborn child can be protected and there are many alternatives that would protect the life of the mother.\u201d That dodge\u2014and the implication, to some ears, that he would let the mother die\u2014is fertile ground for any Democrat who wants to use it.\n\nThere\u2019s also the question of Walker\u2019s electoral success. Of his three statewide wins, two were in midterm years, when Republicans have the advantage. Other than the recall race\u2014which took place in the summer of 2012, well before that November\u2019s national elections\u2014he\u2019s never run during a presidential year, when\u2014in the last two cycles\u2014Democrats have had the advantage. His rhetoric aside, he may not be as electable as he looks.\n\nNone of this means Walker is doomed. If he improves in debates, learns to answer questions, begins to capitalize on missteps from his opponents, and otherwise boosts his performance, he could soar. The raw material is still there. And he wouldn\u2019t be the first presidential candidate to go from a listless start to a strong and successful finish.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:33:45.939+0000"}
{"entityId": 136, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by ASIFE/iStock\n\nIn what may be the consummate legal irony of the summer, Ashley Madison\u2014the adultery-management Web business dedicated to the proposition that one relationship is never quite enough\u2014is suddenly contending with multiple lawsuits, each more explosive than the one before. The website was targeted by hackers who last week exposed more than 30 million client memberships, email addresses, credit card numbers, addresses, and sometimes naughty sexual fantasies. It was socked by a Canadian class-action suit and then by a first volley of American suits this week. That\u2019s just the start of the litigation it now faces.\n\nDahlia Lithwick Dahlia Lithwick writes about the courts and the law for Slate.\n\nThe group calling itself the Impact Team managed to download onto the dark Web a tranche of deeply personal identifying information about tens of millions of users, ostensibly in protest against the company\u2019s predatory practices and lack of privacy protection, but with a thick layer of moral thundering at the clientele and their loose morals. (As the hackers so eloquently put it: \u201cToo bad for those men, they\u2019re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion.\u201d) The fallout was swift and brutal, sweeping up alleged philanderers ranging from Josh Duggar and Christian vlogger Sam Rader to Florida state prosecutor Jeff Ashton to sports and political figures and members of the military and intelligence communities.* According to the Hill, more than 15,000 email addresses associated with accounts were hosted by government agencies or the military.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe biggest worry for the company will be the class-action suits by angry, outed users.\n\nLast week two Canadian law firms filed a $578 million class-action suit against the Toronto-based Avid Life Media, Ashley Madison\u2019s parent company, and Avid Life Dating, a subsidiary that runs the website. The class-action status still needs to be certified by the Ontario court. It\u2019s been filed on behalf of \u201call Canadians\u201d affected by the leak. The lead plaintiff named in the Canadian suit is Ottawa widower Eliot Shore, who joined the website after he lost his wife to breast cancer but never used it to cheat on her. Lawyers for the plaintiffs allege that \u201cin many cases, the users paid an additional fee for the website to remove all of their user data\u2014only to discover that the information was left intact and exposed.\u201d\n\nIn Canada, a class action requires just one or two people to come forward and be willing to be named, and the rest of the class can have their identities protected, which may well encourage more users to come forward without fear of being humiliated for it.\n\nIn the United States, it\u2019s much harder to anonymously join a class-action suit, although at present each of the suits is filed on behalf of a John or Jane Doe. A class-action lawsuit filed in federal district court in California on Monday by a John Doe accuses the Canadian website of negligence and invasion of privacy and of causing emotional distress. According to a report in Reuters, \u201cThe lawsuit claims that the data breach could have been prevented if the company had taken \u2018necessary and reasonable precautions to protect its users\u2019 information, by, for example, encrypting the data.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast reported Monday that a similar suit was filed in Texas as well. Lawyers in the Texas case contend that Ashley Madison should have known about security vulnerabilities in its computer systems because internal documents\u2014also revealed in the hack\u2014made clear that the company had been warned that it was at risk and did nothing.\n\nThe folks who may quickly see legal consequences for their involvement with Ashley Madison are members of the military.\n\nEven before the breach, Ashley Madison was already facing legal trouble. At the end of July, Missouri lawyers had already filed an early class-action suit, Jane Doe v. Avid Life Media Inc. in U.S. District Court seeking more than $5 million in damages. They filed on behalf of an unnamed female plaintiff alleging, among other causes of action, \u201cviolations of the Stored Communications Act (\u201cSCA\u201d), negligence, and breach of implied contract.\u201d\n\nAnd all this is just the beginning. The Rosen Law Firm of New York has posted a call for Ashley Madison users to join a prospective privacy and consumer fraud suit. In its announcement, the firm highlights the fact that the \u201cfull delete\u201d feature advertised by the company opens it up to all sorts of false claims and deceptive trade practices claims, noting that \u201cthe Company lured users, in part, by highlighting publicly its purportedly heightened data security. The Company further attracted users by advertising and marketing a \u2018Full Delete\u2019 service which promised to completely eliminate user profiles and all associated data for a fee.\u201d\n\nAs Russell Brandom explained in the Verge, the greatest challenge for plaintiffs in any data breach case is showing that the users suffered a tangible harm. That will not be a high bar in the Ashley Madison suits. Simply being associated with the company can produce devastating reputational harms for most users.\n\nAshley Madison will likely take the position that since accounts were not verified by the company on signing up, the presence of an email on the database means nothing. They also contend that merely being signed up on the site is not proof, in and of itself, of infidelity. The company has also released a furious statement decrying the smug moralism and criminality of the Impact Team: \u201cThis event is not an act of hacktivism, it is an act of criminality. It is an illegal action against the individual members of AshleyMadison.com, as well as any freethinking people who choose to engage in fully lawful online activities. The criminal, or criminals, involved in this act have appointed themselves as the moral judge, juror, and executioner, seeing fit to impose a personal notion of virtue on all of society. We will not sit idly by and allow these thieves to force their personal ideology on citizens around the world.\u201d\n\nMaybe. But citizens around the world have been regrettably willing to giggle and point at the so-called dirtbags whose information has been stolen and posted. Ashley Madison will also rely on its consumer-unfriendly terms of service statement, which seems to offer the company leeway to argue that consumers took on the risk when they joined the website, as well as its comprehensive release of claims against Ashley Madison for any damages \u201crelated to the release or use of such information by third parties.\u201d\n\nThe folks who may quickly see legal consequences for their involvement with Ashley Madison are the members of the military who signed up. Adultery is still a crime under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. The other real victims of the hack will be people who are being targeted for extortion and blackmail by predators who find their names on the Web. In an attempt reported by security blogger Brian Krebs, a married Ashley Madison user received a demand for cash in exchange for secrecy: \u201cIf you would like to prevent me from finding and sharing this information with your significant other,\u201d the message said, \u201csend exactly 1.0000001 Bitcoins (approx. value $225 USD) to the following address.\u201d There have also been several unconfirmed reports of suicides relating to the hack. In countries where being gay will suffice for a death sentence, victims of the hack who are exposed as homosexual may pay with their lives.\n\nIn addition to the legal questions surrounding the hackees, there will be serious criminal consequences for the hackers, if they are found. Canada\u2019s National Post reports that \u201cthe Ashley Madison hackers would likely be charged under laws against stealing computer data, breaking into computer networks and even \u2018possessing a computer password \u2026 to commit an offence of unauthorized use.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAnd as Lauren Walker notes in Newsweek, perhaps the most worrisome aspect of the public reception of the Ashley Madison scandal is the vicious moral judgment we are willing to direct at the private lives of private figures, simply because they are involved with an adultery website. As Rabeh Soofi, managing attorney at Axis Legal Counsel, a Los Angeles\u2013based privacy law firm, explained to Walker, \u201cWhat is unusual about the Ashley Madison situation is that there seems to be a sentiment that the victims of this data breach are somehow deserving of having their information revealed to the public.\u201d\n\nTulane University\u2019s Amy Gajda, author of The First Amendment Bubble: How Privacy and Paparazzi Threaten a Free Press, is far more sanguine about the way the media have largely respected the privacy of the nonpublic victims of the hack. She notes, in an email, the contrast between the way the press handled the Ashley Madison scandal and \u201cthe backlash after the recent story by Gawker about the CFO alleged to have been looking for sex with a male escort on backpage.com. \u2026 The CFO was seen as more of an average person, I think, someone others could relate to at least in non-public-figure terms, and there was a sort of uprising in favor of his privacy there.\u201d That episode leads Gajda to conclude that \u201cwe find such \u2018private\u2019 people to be worthy of far less scrutiny than politicians, and that, even in an age in which sexual information is available at a click, we still find the release of private sexual information wrong.\u201d\n\nThe truth is we may not know for a long time whether the legal system can vindicate, through class-action suits or agency investigations, the damage done to the real victims of this hack: the wives and the children and the private clients too humiliated to come forward to seek legal help. We have directed a good deal of inchoate contempt to real people suffering real harms who will never come forward to talk about it. A lot of lawyers may get very rich off Ashley Madison. And we may never even learn who the most vulnerable victims were.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:33:49.895+0000"}

China has been focused on reducing emissions: Under a landmark agreement signed with the United States last November, it pledged to peak its emissions by 2030. And under the commitment it has put forward ahead of the U.N. climate talks in Paris in December, it has pledged to increase the share of non\u2013fossil fuels in its energy mix to 20 percent by the same year and reduce its carbon intensity\u2014the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of GDP\u2014by 60 percent to 65 percent below 2005 levels. But economic conditions may play as much of a role in its emissions reduction over the next few years as government policy.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nAs the Wall Street Journal reported last month, the \u201cwar on pollution\u201d declared by Xi Jinping\u2019s government in response to public outrage over notoriously polluted air, water, and soil has been aided by the bleak state of the country\u2019s heavy industries. Particulate levels in Beijing are finally falling, and the capital has been blessed with unusual stretches of blue-sky days, in part thanks to the government\u2019s crackdown on coal-fired power plants, but also because factories all around Beijing are shutting down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nChina\u2019s coal use\u2014alone one of the major drivers of climate change\u2014fell for the first time in a century last year, and environmentalists have begun to tentatively hope that it has permanently peaked years ahead of schedule. Government environmental policies may have played some role in that, but so has an overall slowdown in heavy industry that has also impacted imports of rubber, iron ore, and other materials. According to the International Energy Agency, the slowdown in the Chinese economy, and the corresponding reduction in coal use, is the main reason why global emissions remained flat in 2014 despite the global economy growing by 3 percent.\n\nIn one promising sign, even amid this week\u2019s turmoil, Chinese legislators are considering an air pollution law that would give the central government more power to punish negligent companies and local authorities and impose new caps on coal consumption.\n\nIf the downturn might be, on balance, good news for the world\u2019s climate, it\u2019s bad news for the countries whose economies are tied in large part to fueling China\u2019s explosive growth.

{"entityId": 141, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Carolyn Cole/Los Angeles Times via Getty Images\n\nImmigration is back in the news, thanks to Donald Trump. He has sparked attention by arguing that people who entered the country illegally should be rounded up and expelled and that birthright citizenship should be revoked, a proposal (briefly) echoed by Scott Walker. Neither of these things will happen. Deporting 11 million people is too expensive, and birthright citizenship is rooted in legal and constitutional norms going back to the Civil War. But the interesting thing is not the proposal but the amount of attention it received. Why?\n\nIn an informative article in Vox, Dara Lind argues that Trump appeals to anxieties that are disregarded by nearly everyone in the political elite, including the other Republican candidates. Citing academic studies, Lind shows that the public debate about immigration\u2014which focuses on the effect of immigration on jobs\u2014overlooks what many Americans, and most Republicans, care more about: culture. Many Americans\u2014and not just right-wing Republicans\u2014see immigration as a threat to their cultural identity, and that is what they are afraid of. Indeed, they are not terribly worried about the effect of immigration on jobs; \u201cjobs\u201d has become code for \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMainstream politicians use this code because it is hard to mention culture explicitly without sounding racist. Most immigrants living in the country illegally are Hispanic, so an argument against illegal immigration on cultural grounds sounds like a rejection of people who speak Spanish and worship in Catholic churches. Such arguments can\u2019t be, and aren\u2019t, made in polite society.\n\nYet Americans do care about culture, and this is not something to be embarrassed about. Consider liberal cultural values that (I suspect) most readers of Slate share. Liberals value artistic expression, tolerance for minority sexual practices, and religious freedom. They don\u2019t like guns, evangelical religion, and macho posturing. They believe that eccentric behavior should be tolerated as long as it doesn\u2019t harm anyone. A large influx of immigrants from, say, Saudi Arabia could transform a culturally liberal neighborhood into a religious neighborhood where women wear veils and the call to prayer rings out five times a day. Whatever they say about the value of diversity, liberals don\u2019t really want to live in such a place. Indeed, Europeans have had to confront just this threat to their liberal values, as conservative Muslims from North Africa who have settled in Europe refuse to abandon values and practices that Europeans reject as sexist, patriarchal, and intolerant.\n\n\u201cJobs\u201d has become code for \u201cculture.\u201d\n\nOf course, the Americans who oppose immigration on cultural grounds tend not to be liberals. Their cultural values differ. Many, for example, emphasize self-reliance (and oppose gun control and welfare); evangelical Christianity; and military virtues such as discipline, obedience, and loyalty. Whether you share these values or not, people who hold them are just as entitled to defend them as liberals are entitled to defend their own. If they believe that immigration threatens their values, their arguments should be taken seriously. Trump, alone among the candidates, seems to realize this. As a friend who witnessed a Trump rally in Phoenix said to me: People said they worried about jobs and crime, but they were clearly angry \u201cbecause supermercados are opening in traditionally white neighborhoods across Arizona.\u201d\n\nIn an influential but much criticized book that many people saw as xenophobic if not racist, Samuel Huntington took this argument a step further. He argued that through most of its history, American culture has reflected the rather specific cultural values of English Protestant dissenters who settled this country in the 17th and 18th centuries. Their values emphasized work ethic, individualism, personal responsibility, and other virtues that\u2014as Max Weber argued\u2014underlie capitalism as well as the American style of liberal democracy. Huntington saw the influx of Catholic Hispanics in the 1980s and 1990s\u2014with legal permission and without\u2014as a threat to American culture. Catholicism, in Huntington\u2019s telling, disapproves of money-making, makes a virtue of poverty, venerates tradition, and tolerates authoritarian governance. And while immigrants in earlier waves adopted American values, Huntington feared that Hispanic immigrants would by their sheer numbers be able to maintain communities in which those values did not prevail.\n\nWe don\u2019t need to agree with the details of Huntington\u2019s argument to see that he may have a point. Numerous academic studies show that cultural values influence political values and economic prosperity. In these studies, Protestantism plays less of a role in determining economic and political outcomes than Weber thought, and the story is a lot more complex. Some scholars believe that certain cultural values\u2014including those that touch on the role of women and on the nature of political authority\u2014can be traced to the agricultural practices of preindustrial groups from which we moderns descend. Major events\u2014like imperial conquest, slave-raiding, and war\u2014can produce lasting cultural effects as well that over the long term can result in illiberal, corrupt, and unstable political institutions.\n\nIf a huge influx of authoritarians, or conservative Muslims, or religious extremists settled in America, could it change our culture? It certainly could. Could the risk of the cultural change justify restrictions on migration? Of course.\n\nWhy don\u2019t these risks receive any attention? One reason is that in the United States, unlike in Europe, no mass migration\u2014not even the influx of Hispanics\u2014has been large enough to cause a fundamental change in cultural values, at least not at a national level (as opposed to some local cultural shifts, for instance in Miami). The country is vast and diverse; and because it welcomes most immigrants, they or their children tend to assimilate, unlike in Europe, where many migrants live in enclaves that preserve the language and cultural values of their forefathers.\n\nBut there is another reason why these issues are not discussed. Culture is taboo because of its association with white supremacy\u2014which is one of the reasons people accuse Trump of racism\u2014and because of the very diversity of this country. That diversity means a diversity of cultures and a diversity of views about what our culture should be. If Congress tried to pass a law that required immigrants to adopt American cultural values or that blocked migration by those who rejected our values, it would get bogged down in an endless and vituperative debate about what those cultural values are or should be. Immigration legislation has avoided the question of cultural values by providing for immigration based on economic contribution and family connections and restricting the fraction of immigrants who can come from any single country.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:34:25.125+0000"}
{"entityId": 142, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nLet\u2019s get started. Give me the latest.\n\nHappy Tuesday! Stocks in China sold off again overnight. Elsewhere, things look to be stabilizing. European shares opened higher. U.S. futures are pointing sharply up.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhoa, slow down. I still hear Jim Cramer yelling and feel vague pangs of doom. What the hell is happening?\n\nA lot! Stock markets have been in tumult all around the world since last week. But Monday was especially violent\u2014think barrels tumbling off Niagara Falls. It was bad in China, in London, in Japan. Here in the States, the S&P 500 dove about 4 percent, with the Dow and the Nasdaq taking similar spills. Over the past five days, the benchmark S&P index has lost more than 200 points, or about 9.7 percent, putting it on track for the worst August in 17 years.\n\nSo far on Tuesday, shares in Shanghai closed down another 7.6 percent. They\u2019ve now toppled more than 15 percent over the past two days alone. This, despite the fact that China\u2019s central bank injected 150 billion yuan (about $23.4 billion) into the financial system. Analysts have started describing that market with adjectives like \u201cself-imploding.\u201d Exciting stuff!\n\n\n\nDonald Trump says this is all China\u2019s fault. Is it China\u2019s fault?\n\nKind of, though it\u2019d be a gross oversimplification to pin this all on China. But financial, economic, and monetary worries in the Middle Kingdom are definitely spooking U.S. investors.\n\nSo what exactly did China do?\n\nThe shortish version is that this all started two weeks ago when China decided to devalue its currency. For two straight days, China\u2019s central bank allowed the yuan to fall by nearly 2 percent, then keep edging down. This caught a lot of people off guard. China has kept a tight grip on its currency exchange rate for 20-some years. Since March, the yuan hadn\u2019t moved more than 0.3 percent in a single day. For it to suddenly plunge 4.4 percent in a matter of days sent shivers through the global markets.\n\nOn top of that, we\u2019ve also seen a lot of scary economic data come out of China over the past two weeks. Exports, a traditional mainstay of the Chinese economy, slumped a worse-than-expected 8.3 percent in July. (One theory for why the People\u2019s Bank of China let the yuan slide was to prop up exports.) In August, China\u2019s factory sector shrank faster than it had in six years. Sales of smartphones in China during the second quarter fell year over year for the first time ever. By official tallies, China\u2019s economy is growing at a rate of 7 percent. But based on everything else we know, that\u2019s looking less and less like reality.\n\nThat was the short version? That wasn\u2019t short!\n\nOK, fair. But it was shorter than the longer version.\n\nUh, do I need the longer version?\n\nWell, here it is in a nutshell. Basically, people knew that China\u2019s economy was slowing, but they didn\u2019t know by how much. Everything that\u2019s happened recently\u2014the currency devaluation, the spate of poor economic data, the generally baffling response from Beijing\u2014has only served to increase two fears. One, that China\u2019s economy is in much worse shape than anyone realized. Two, that Chinese policymakers don\u2019t actually have some grand master plan for the economy that explains the ups and downs of the past few weeks\u2014that they might just be winging it.\n\nBoth of these scenarios are terrifying to investors worldwide because of the outsize role that China plays in the global economy. China is second only to the U.S. in terms of gross domestic product. And in recent years, China has accounted for up to half of global growth, though it makes up just 15 percent of global output. But core segments of the Chinese economy are sputtering, like consumer spending, construction, and financial services. Some economists fear certain provinces and regions could be facing outright recessions. Once China\u2019s slowdown gets big enough, it doesn\u2019t happen in isolation\u2014it drags the rest of the world along.\n\nPhoto by Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOK, that\u2019s China. But someone on CNBC is mumbling about the Federal Reserve. Should I be pissed at Janet Yellen?\n\nJanet Yellen is a delightful, brilliant woman, and you should harbor no ill will toward her.\n\nBut yes, some of this might be the Federal Reserve\u2019s doing. For a while now, the central bank has been signaling its intention to hike interest rates, which has people scared for a couple of reasons. Higher interest rates make borrowing more expensive, which is generally bad for corporate profits and stocks prices. They also make the dollar more valuable, since they reduce the chances of inflation, and attract more foreign investment into things like Treasurys and U.S. corporate bonds.\n\nThe dollar has already been on a tear, and it could be a problem for the rest of the world if it goes higher, since it will become harder for international companies that borrowed in dollars to pay off their debts. On the flip side, a pricier greenback makes it tougher for U.S. companies to sell their stuff abroad. Which is why some people are wondering whether all the tumult we\u2019ve seen might well convince the Fed to hold off on its increase for a bit.\n\nWait, let\u2019s back up. What\u2019s a stock market?\n\nDon\u2019t be cute, you know what a stock market is.\n\nThat said, I\u2019m guessing you might have heard a few finance types talking about \u201cequities\u201d markets as well. \u201cEquities\u201d is just a fancy word for \u201cstocks.\u201d Don\u2019t let the talking heads on TV confuse you.\n\nOK. Those talking heads keep mentioning \u201ca correction.\u201d What\u2019s that all about?\n\nA correction is just the shorthand stock analysts use to describe when the market falls 10 percent below its recent highs. We\u2019re just about there right now. Thankfully, Jonathan Franzen is in no way involved.\n\nPhew. That guy\u2019s a jerk. So should I sell my stocks and finally make use of that doomsday shelter I\u2019ve been prepping?\n\nThe natural reaction in moments like these is to panic. But please resist the urge. Unless you desperately need the money in short order and can\u2019t risk the market falling any further, it\u2019s generally best not to sell stocks after a big drop. And if you do desperately need the money in short order, you probably shouldn\u2019t have had it in stocks to begin with. When you need dollars on command, cash is king.\n\nShould I buy some stocks, then?\n\nMaybe? Obviously, it\u2019s a good idea to buy low and sell high. And, typically, stocks bounce back after the S&P 500 falls by more than 5 percent in a week. But sometimes they don\u2019t. A solid rule of thumb: If you were planning to invest some money anyway, and won\u2019t need it for a long while, then now is as good a time as any to put money in the market. You\u2019re certainly better off buying today than you were two weeks ago.\n\nOn another note, if you\u2019re the sort of person who actively manages your retirement portfolio (in which case you\u2019ve probably skipped over this section), it might be time to do a little rebalancing.\n\nPhoto by Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nIs the American economy screwed?\n\nNot really, or at least not yet.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that stock prices aren\u2019t the best measure of the economy\u2019s overall health. Remember how crappy the U.S. recovery felt back in 2010? Well, shares were surging then. And while a bull market might slightly benefit the economy as a whole through a modest \u201cwealth effect\u201d\u2014meaning that when portfolios rise in value, people feel richer and spend more\u2014most families simply don\u2019t own that much stock. In 2013, the bottom 90 percent of U.S. households laid claim to less than 20 percent of all shares, according to New York University economist Edward Wolff.* The fraction is even tinier if you exclude hard-to-access retirement accounts like 401(k)s. So, in a sense, when the market crashes, it\u2019s mostly a problem for the rich.\n\nOf course, there are some real economic troubles shaping up abroad that could hurt American businesses. Companies that sell lots of goods in China, like Apple and General Motors, could be in for a rough patch, for instance. But thankfully, the U.S. as a whole is a little bit insulated from the world\u2019s troubles, because so much of our growth is driven by how Americans spend here at home, rather than by exports. In fact, the relative strength of the U.S. economy is part of the problem here. If the job market were weaker, the Federal Reserve wouldn\u2019t seriously be contemplating an interest rate hike in the near future, which as we noted is one of the issues that people think is driving the market downturn.\n\nThere might also be an upside for middle-class families in all this: cheaper gas. With demand slumping in the rest of the world, the price of U.S. oil has fallen below $40 a barrel, which is quite cheap. Of course, this isn\u2019t great for rig workers in the Texas or North Dakota. But drivers should be able to fill up their tanks for a song this autumn.\n\nThat said, there is some case for pessimism. America does export quite a bit. And if the rest of the world were to plunge into a serious recession, we\u2019d probably start to feel some of the pain. And again, if the dollar\u2019s value keeps rising, it will become ever harder for our businesses to sell smartphones, Chevys, and beef abroad, while making foreign profits that have to be converted into dollars less valuable. So there could be some trouble ahead. And given that the outlook for U.S. growth is fairly weak already, we don\u2019t have a huge buffer to rely on.\n\nI\u2019m still gripped by a nebulous sense of dread. Is there any way this could turn into a financial crisis like 2008?\n\nIt\u2019s highly unlikely.\n\nWhile everyday investors care a lot about stocks, share prices aren\u2019t really essential to the health of the world\u2019s financial system. By contrast, securities backed by American mortgages, which really had become the lifeblood of global finance, turned toxic in 2007 and 2008, which led investors to panic. It all came to a head with the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which sent the market into paroxysms because a) Lehman was a very large investment bank that owed lots of people money and b) nobody knew whether the U.S. would allow other major financial institutions to fail. Right now, it\u2019s really hard to envision a similar chain of events. Meanwhile, Bloomberg seemed to float the idea that by devaluing the yuan, China could set off a currency war with consequences similar to the emerging market crisis of the 1990s. But it also didn\u2019t find a single expert who thought that was realistic.\n\nYou seem awfully relaxed about all this. Should I just completely tune all this market news out? Why does any of this matter to my life?\n\nWe should all strive to be informed global citizens. Also, in the unlikely event that the entire world really does collapse into a financial crisis, you won\u2019t have to waste time catching up on the action.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:34:31.727+0000"}

To these Democrats, Clinton isn\u2019t a strong bet, and worse, there isn\u2019t a strong alternative. Bernie Sanders? Popular, but too far to the left to unify a broad and diverse national party. Martin O\u2019Malley? Not exciting.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nEnter Joe Biden. The sitting vice president is the third-most visible Democratic politician behind President Barack Obama and Clinton. The Wall Street Journal reports he\u2019s moving closer to a run: He has sat with political allies, talked with family, and even met with influential Democrats like Elizabeth Warren. Yes, if he ran he\u2019d start from behind, but he\u2019s popular and could build a formidable primary campaign with the right backing and staff.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s also something to the idea of a Biden run. Even as the favorite, Clinton needs an effective sparing partner on the trail. A Biden run might be good for her skills as a candidate\u2014a point I\u2019ve argued before. But it\u2019s worth stepping from the horserace to ask a different kind of question: Would a run be good for Biden? Large parts of the Democratic Party\u2014including a confrontational activist movement\u2014are committed to de-escalating the war on drugs and moving crime policy away from the approach of the 1980s and 1990s, an approach that Biden pioneered. This is more than trouble for his still-hypothetical campaign; it\u2019s trouble for his legacy.\n\nA large part of running for president is intense scrutiny on personal history and political records. But once you\u2019re in office, that scrutiny subsides. Once you\u2019ve left, it almost disappears. Right now, Biden is beloved, an avuncular and light-hearted figure who contrasts the president\u2019s stoic cool and adds a touch of heart to the seemingly mechanistic Obama White House. Forgotten (at least, outside academia and a few corners of political media) is Biden\u2019s earlier persona: a leader in America\u2019s drug war. For a generation, Biden was at the front of a national push for tough drug laws and police militarization.\n\nIf you consider her time in Bill Clinton\u2019s White House, that\u2019s true for Hillary, too. The difference is that she was first lady\u2014an advocate for her husband\u2019s policies, but not a lawmaker. That\u2019s why she\u2019s able to meet face to face with members of the Black Lives Matter movement and not look disingenuous when she says she has changed her mind on the subject. Biden\u2019s Senate career, by contrast, was defined by his aggressive and vocal support for the drug war. Here are the highlights of that history:\n\nIn 1984, he worked with Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond and the Reagan administration to craft and pass the Comprehensive Control Act, which enhanced and expanded civil asset forfeiture, and entitled local police departments to a share of captured assets. Critics say this incentivizes abuse, citing countless cases of unfair and unaccountable seizures. In one case last February, Drug Enforcement Administration officers seized $11,000 in cash from a 24-year-old college student. They didn\u2019t find guns or drugs, but they kept the money anyway.\n\nIn 1986, Biden co-sponsored the Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which created new mandatory minimum sentences for drugs, including the infamous crack-versus-cocaine sentencing disparity. A crack cocaine user with only five grams would receive five years without parole, while a powder cocaine user had to possess 500 grams before seeing the same punishment. The predictable consequence was a federal drug regime that put its toughest penalties on low-level drug sellers and the most impoverished drug users.\n\nBiden would also play an important role in crafting the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which strengthened mandatory minimums for drug possession, enhanced penalties for people who transport drugs, and established the Office of National Drug Control Policy, whose director was christened \u201cdrug czar\u201d by Biden.\n\nHis broadest contribution to crime policy was the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, commonly called the 1994 Crime Bill. Written by Biden and signed by President Clinton, it increased funds for police and prisons, fueling a huge expansion of the federal prison population. As journalist Radley Balko details in The Rise of The Warrior Cop: The Militarization of America\u2019s Police Forces, it also contributed to the rapid growth of militarized police forces that used new federal funds to purchase hundreds of thousands of pieces of military equipment, from flak jackets and automatic rifles to armored vehicles and grenade launchers.\n\nThe \u201ccrime bill\u201d also brought a host of new federal death penalty crimes, which Biden celebrated in his defense of the bill. \u201cLet me define the liberal wing of the Democratic Party,\u201d he said to Sen. Orrin Hatch, \u201cThe liberal wing of the Democratic Party is now for 60 new death penalties \u2026 the liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 100,000 cops. The liberal wing of the Democratic Party is for 125,000 new state prison cells.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true that much of this\u2014especially the most egregious and ill-conceived measures\u2014was a response to extraordinarily high crime rates that devastated urban communities. Many of Biden\u2019s allies, in fact, were black Democrats from communities where violence was common and pervasive. But Biden would keep this approach, even as violent crime declined through the 1990s and into the 2000s. He would continue to vote for strong anti-drug efforts, going as far as to push for a federal crackdown on raves, citing ecstasy distribution. While Biden has shifted on some drug issues, he remains a staunch defender of his record on crime, even as Bill and Hillary Clinton have expressed their regret for the consequences of the 1994 crime bill and other anti-drug policies.\n\nJoe Biden, in other words, is the Democratic face of the drug war. \u201cThere\u2019s a tendency now to talk about Joe Biden as the sort of affable if inappropriate uncle, as loudmouth and silly,\u201d says sociologist Naomi Murakawa in an interview with the Marshall Project to discuss her book The First Civil Right: How Liberals Built Prison America. \u201cBut he\u2019s actually done really deeply disturbing, dangerous reforms that have made the criminal justice system more lethal and just bigger.\u201d In a Democratic primary that increasingly turns on these issues, having to defend or walk back those positions is a bad place to occupy. His opponents\u2014whether Clinton or Bernie Sanders or Martin O\u2019Malley\u2014will use his record against him, and millions of Democrats will begin to see him like Murakawa does: as someone who widened the path to prison for countless young men of color.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:34:37.711+0000"}

He was really talking about Asians when he deployed the term last week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cWhat I was talking about was the specific case of fraud being committed where there\u2019s organized efforts\u2014and, frankly, it\u2019s more related to Asian people\u2014coming into our country, having children, and in those organized efforts taking advantage of a noble concept which is birthright citizenship,\u201d Bush said in a lengthy response during which he called it \u201cludicrous\u201d to suggest the term was insulting, especially since he is personally \u201cimmersed in the immigrant experience.\u201d (For those keeping score at home, this is at least the second time that Bush has cost himself with a casual aside on the campaign trail.)\n\n[Update 6:06 p.m.: While it was unclear from his comments, it's possible that Bush was trying to allude to so-called birth tourism, whereby a foreign family, often Chinese, pays handsomely to have their child in the United States. That, though, was clearly not the context in which Bush used the term earlier this week\u2014nor is it a significant driver of immigration.]\n\nAs I explained last week, Bush\u2019s defiant use of such inflammatory slang was so striking in the moment because, in a GOP nominating contest currently dominated by anti-immigrant belligerence, Jeb has tried to present himself as the levelheaded, compassionate adult. Meanwhile, the Hispanic Leadership Network, a center-right group that he helped found and remains connected with, was already on the record urging politicians not to use the term. The fact that Bush used it while defending birthright citizenship only made things even more bizarre.\n\nBush\u2019s latest immigration-themed stumble illustrates a larger point that my colleague Jamelle Bouie made last week: The GOP\u2019s current Donald Trump-led immigration debate won\u2019t just cost its eventual nominee with Hispanic voters\u2014it\u2019s also likely to turn off other immigrant communities as well, particularly Asian Americans. \u201cThis rhetoric matters to them too,\u201d Jamelle wrote.

The issues Walker highlights\u2014cyberattacks, militarization of the South China Sea, human rights abuses\u2014are serious concerns, and I would hope President Obama uses the visit to press Xi on all of them. Walker seems to think that these concerns would be best addressed by snubbing Xi altogether, even though he himself met with Xi in a 2013 visit to China, when relations weren\u2019t significantly better than they are now.

It\u2019s true that other countries have long had good reason to accuse China of keeping the yuan artificially low, but the IMF says the currency is no longer undervalued.

Under repeated questioning from George Stephanopoulos, Walker ultimately said that he would not try to alter the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to anyone born in the United States regardless of the legal status of their parents.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\n\"No,\" Walker eventually said after dodging the first two questions about whether he agreed with Donald Trump\u2019s calls to end the practice. \u201cMy point is any discussion that goes beyond securing the border and enforcing laws are things that should be a red flag to voters out there who for years have heard lip service from politicians and are understandably angry.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from how the Wisconsin governor answered the same question last Monday. \u201cYeah, absolutely,\u201d Walker said when asked by an MSNBC reporter at the Iowa State Fair whether he wanted to end birthright citizenship. It was also a stark departure from how the GOP hopeful addressed the topic this past Friday during an interview with CNBC. \u201cI\u2019m not taking a position on it one way or the other,\u201d he said then. \u201cI\u2019m saying that until you secure the border and enforce the laws, any discussion of about anything else is really looking past the very things we have to do.\u201d\n\nSo do Walker\u2019s comments Sunday represent his latest immigration flip-flop? I don\u2019t think so. A better characterization of Scott Walker\u2019s position on birthright citizenship would be to say that Scott Walker has no position.\n\nConsider his campaign\u2019s response to a request from the Washington Post following Sunday\u2019s ABC interview for a clear, yes-or-no answer to whether Walker wants to end birthright citizenship. \u201cHis position is very firm: We have to secure the border and enforce the laws first,\u201d a spokeswoman said in an email. \u201cHe has been saying this all week long. You have heard him say that countless times. I know what you're asking for but just because you're not satisfied with his answer doesn't make his any less worthy.\"\n\nIf you set aside his equivocations, then, Walker\u2019s position on a practice enshrined in the U.S. Constitution is actually quite clear: He won\u2019t take one. This is not a politically calculated flip-flop; it\u2019s a politically cowardly nonanswer. He\u2019s afraid that if he comes out explicitly in support of birthright citizenship, he\u2019ll turn off those conservative hardliners he\u2019ll need in the primary\u2014and he\u2019s afraid if he comes out against it, he\u2019ll scare away the more moderate voters he\u2019d need in the general election.\n\nFinding a way to generally thread that needle was always going to be a problem for the GOP\u2019s most legitimate contenders, but The Donald\u2019s unexpected entry and even more unexpected rise have made it exponentially more difficult. Trump\u2019s anti-birthright proposal would have once been unthinkable in the party of Lincoln. In the GOP primary\u2019s current anti-immigrant environment, though, it quickly picked up varying degrees of support from a host of Trump\u2019s rivals, including Ben Carson, Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, and even longtime reform advocate Lindsey Graham. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, meanwhile, have stood out in the crowded field for their vocal\u2014and, in Bush\u2019s case, incredibly inelegant\u2014opposition to the change.\n\nThe challenge posed to Walker by the birthright test in specific\u2014and the Trump-led immigration debate in general\u2014is unique. Like Rubio and Bush, Walker is an establishment favorite in a race currently being dominated by anti-establishment fervor. He has good reason to keep one eye on November 2016. More than his two main rivals, though, Walker is unlikely to make it that far unless he can capture some of that outsider energy, too\u2014particularly given Jeb holds massive fundraising and organizational advantages among party elites, and Rubio has positioned himself to swoop in if Bush stumbles. That\u2019s why even as Walker was bobbing and weaving on Sunday, he paused long enough to nod to conservative anger. \u201cOne thing that I do want to clarify is I do think that there is some real frustration out there,\" Walker told Stephanopoulos, adding: \u201cThey're angry at Washington.

This year, a group of mostly straight white men\u2014threatened by the increasing amount of attention paid to women and people of color exploring progressive ideas in sci-fi\u2014tried to hijack the Hugos. Calling themselves the Sad Puppies, with a more viciously right-wing spin-off called the Rabid Puppies, they exploited the Hugos' open nominating process to stuff the ballot box with writers they perceive as friendly to conservative interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe effort did mean that the ballots people voted on were front-loaded with Puppy-favored writers, but the whole stunt ultimately failed. \u201cNot a single Puppy-endorsed candidate took home a rocket,\u201d Amy Wallace at Wired writes. \u201cIn the five categories that had only Puppy-provided nominees on the ballot\u2014Best Novella, Best Short Story, Best Related Work, and Best Editor for Short and for Long Form\u2014voters instead preferred \u2018No Award.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWallace spent a lot of time interviewing Puppies, of both the Sad and Rabid variety, about their motivations. It all sounds very familiar. Just replace the words sci-fi with America or mainstream media, and the Puppy rationalizations are indistinguishable from what you'd hear from Donald Trump and his supporters: that they are simple, good-hearted men whose Earth has been ravaged by racial minorities, queers, and feminists, all of whom have less merit than most any straight white guys but who are boosted unfairly by the affirmative-action agenda of politically correct hipsters and cultural elites. Wallace explains:\n\nThey say their beef is more class-based; [author Brad Torgersen] says his books are blue-collar speculative fiction. The Hugos, they say, are snobby and exclusionary, and too often ignore books that are merely popular, by conservative writers. The Sad Puppies have a name for those who oppose them: CHORFS, for \u201cCliquish, Holier-than-thou, Obnoxious, Reactionary Fanatics.\u201d\n\nOn the phone from the Middle East, where he is currently deployed, Torgersen lamented what he called \u201cthe cognitive dissonance of people saying, \u2018No, the Hugos are about quality,\u2019 and then at the same time they\u2019re like: \u2018Ooh, we can vote for this author because they\u2019re gay, or for this story because it\u2019s got gay characters,\u2019 or, \u2018Ooh, we\u2019re going to vote for this author because they\u2019re not white.\u2019 As soon as that becomes the criteria, well, quality goes out the window.\u201d\n\nAs Jeet Heer at the New Republic notes in a piece about Donald Trump, this kind of reactionary rhetoric is often framed as populist, but it is in fact \u201cthe voice of aggrieved privilege\u2014of those who already are doing well but feel threatened by social change from below.\u201d So it is with the Puppies. Far from being the bullied outsiders who can't catch a break, the guys are doing pretty well by themselves.

Or, as Cruz describes it, support for \u201creligious liberty.\u201d\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nAs my Slate colleague Josh Voorhees recently noted, Cruz has centered his campaign around a handful of people who inflicted their anti-gay views on others and faced legal repercussions for doing so. In July, he interviewed a couple who refused to rent out their wedding venue to a same-sex couple, gushing that their discrimination \u201cinspired\u201d him. On Friday, he held an Iowa rally featuring \u201cSPECIAL GUESTS VICTIMIZED BY GOVERNMENT PERSECUTION.\u201d Now he has released a video profiling some of \u201cvictims.\u201d Let\u2019s watch it and debunk its jiggery-pokery point by point.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n1. \u201cToday, the United States government is forcing people of faith to violate their beliefs on marriage and sexuality.\u201d\n\nThe video trumpets this alarming statement as fact. And it is\u2014if you think requiring businesses and individuals to follow neutral, generally applicable laws and regulations qualifies as \u201cforcing people of faith to violate their beliefs.\u201d If you think, however, that nobody should be granted a special right to discriminate solely because of their beliefs, then this statement is just more alarmist propaganda brought to you by the Christian persecution complex.\n\nNote, by the way, that until this June, many states were eagerly depriving gay people of their fundamental right to marry\u2014forcing them to violate their own beliefs on marriage and sexuality by excluding them from an institution central to their lives and faith. Oddly, Cruz\u2019s video makes no mention of the serious harms gay people suffered when their states singled them out for mistreatment under the law.\n\n2. Air Force Senior Master Sgt. Phillip Monk was \u201crelieved of duty for expressing a traditional view of marriage.\u201d\n\nThe first part of this statement\u2014that Monk was \u201crelieved of duty\u201d\u2014is actually true! Unfortunately, Monk himself then claims he was \u201cfired,\u201d which is not true. Here\u2019s what really happened: Monk supervised a staff sergeant who fervently informed trainees about his deep abhorrence of gay people. This action violated a policy barring officers from using a position of authority to promote their own religious beliefs. Monk\u2019s commanding officer\u2014who happened to be a lesbian\u2014insisted that the staff sergeant be punished. When Monk resisted, because he held the same beliefs, the military reassigned him to a new position commensurate with his rank.\n\nMonk says he \u201chad to relent to being fired in order to not violate [his] conscience.\u201d He was not fired, and he was only asked to adhere to a firmly established, commonsense policy. Contra his sniffling, pitiful confession in Cruz\u2019s video, he did not face discrimination. Quite the opposite: He attempted to condone discrimination and faced the consequences.\n\n3. Atlanta Fire Rescue Department Chief Kelvin Cochran was \u201csuspended and terminated from his decorated post. \u2026 Not for any wrongful action, but because of his Christian beliefs on homosexuality.\u201d\n\nSo states the video. But it\u2019s not really true! In fact, there was a very specific \u201cwrongful action\u201d for which Cochran was punished: He distributed his profoundly homophobic book to a number of employees, unsolicited, at work. In one passage, Cochran defines \u201cuncleanness\u201d as \u201cwhatever is opposite of purity, including sodomy, homosexuality, lesbianism, pederasty, bestiality, all other forms of sexual perversion.\u201d\n\nUnderstandably, employees complained, and the city suspended Cochran, investigating a potential violation of its nondiscrimination laws. Eventually city officials fired him, citing his poor \u201cjudgment and management skills.\u201d Cochran is now suing the city, alleging it discriminated against his Christian beliefs.\n\nIt is instructive to do a little role reversal here. Imagine that a gay boss wrote a book calling Christians \u201cunclean,\u201d comparing them to child molesters, and describing Christianity as \u201cvile, vulgar and inappropriate.\u201d Now imagine that he handed this book, unsolicited, to Christian employees. If he were fired, would you consider his dismissal to be an act of discrimination against the boss\u2019s sexual orientation? If not, you probably shouldn\u2019t put much stock in Cochran\u2019s claims.\n\n4.

Instead, the school board compromised on the instructive sticker.\n\nThe only reason news of this outrage traveled beyond the borders of Gilbert is because a parent in the district happens to be a New York Times\u00ad\u2013best-selling young-adult novelist with a sizable Twitter following.

Bernstein/Getty Images\n\nAs of late, logorrheic reality television star Donald Trump has managed to find a new target on which to hock gobs of populist resentment, and for once, it's a pretty reasonable one. \u201cThe hedge fund guys are getting away with murder,\u201d he said on CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday, reiterating comments he had made to Time magazine. Of course, the issue was taxes. \"They're paying nothing and it's ridiculous. I want to save the middle class,\" Trump said. \"The hedge fund guys didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.\"\n\n\n\nPer usual with Trump, it's a bit of an exaggeration to say hedge funders are paying \"nothing\" to the IRS. But as Slate's Daniel Politi noted over the weekend, Trump was likely talking about the carried interest rule, the loophole that hands private equity, venture capital, and a some hedge fund managers a huge tax break by treating most of their earnings as capital gains rather than normal income. Long controversial, the rule was the subject of a lot of discussion during the 2012 presidential election thanks to Mitt Romney, who as a former private equity baron benefited from it mightily.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nA quick review of how carried interest works: Private equity and hedge fund big shots are compensated based on what's known as a \"two and twenty\" rule. First, they earn a management fee equal to 2 percent of the investments under their watch. That money is guaranteed no matter how their portfolio fares, and is taxed like ordinary income, at a top rate of 39.6 percent. But on top of that, managers also get a 20 percent cut of their fund's profits. That's called carried interest, and today it's taxed as investment income, with a top long-term capital gains rate of 23.8 percent (once you include Obamacare's surcharge on investment earnings). That break is, obviously, worth quite a bit of money to many a financier (though, contra Trump, hedge funds don't benefit from it quite so much as commonly assumed, because they frequently don't hold assets long enough to qualify for the long-term capital gains rate in the first place).\n\n\n\nYou can find some very involved justifications for this quirk of the tax code. But most reasonable people, including some conservative economists like Harvard's Greg Mankiw, admit it's pretty obviously unfair. Hedge fund and private equity founders do often put a bit of their own capital on the line. But mostly, they're being paid for their labor as managers. So, it makes sense to hit them with the same tax rate that would apply to any other kind labor, not a lower rate meant to encourage more investment. Some estimates have suggested that doing so could raise as much as $17.7 billion over a decade, which, while perhaps not a boatload of money, isn't nothing.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:35:18.581+0000"}

Elizabeth Warren at his Naval Observatory home on Saturday night, immediately sending speculation through the roof that he is getting closer to announcing a presidential run. The progressive wings of the Democratic Party have long been urging Warren to challenge Hillary Clinton, and she has yet to endorse anyone in the primary contest. The meeting with Warren, which was first reported by CNN, \u201cdoesn\u2019t necessarily mean a Biden-Warren ticket for 2016, but it showed Democratic party activists and donors how seriously he\u2019s pondering a late run for president,\u201d points out Bloomberg.\n\nThe meeting is seen as particularly significant because if Biden manages to get even implicit support from Warren, it could help generate support for a late candidacy. Plus, if Biden is able to convince those who have been trying to draft Warren to work for him, it would give him some much-needed infrastructure that could help the vice president catch up with Clinton and Bernie Sanders. There are other pluses to receiving Warren\u2019s backing. Politico explains:\n\nWarren\u2019s support could also exploit perceived vulnerabilities that Clinton has on economic issues, in being seen as too much of a moderate. Part of the Biden argument, if he launches, would be on his record of middle-class values, and Warren could help him graft that to the support she\u2019s generated among progressives, particularly younger ones, for taking on the banks and speaking out on income inequality. That she\u2019s perhaps the second most-prominent woman in the Democratic Party would only help him make the argument against Clinton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJoshua Alcorn, who is a Draft Biden 2016 senior adviser, told Fox News that it was not surprising that the vice president would meet with Warren. \u201cShe has important, incredible ideas on making the economy work for everyone,\u201d Alcorn said.

{"entityId": 161, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Yahoo Finance\n\nFriday\u2019s stock market tumble could only be described as a rout. The S&P 500 plunged 64 points or 3.19 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 531 points or 3.12 percent. And the Nasdaq toppled 171 points or 3.52 percent. That built off downward momentum from Thursday, when the three major indices each fell by more than 2 percent. Altogether, it was the worst week for U.S. stocks since 2011. What\u2019s the deal? As with most sudden disturbances in the stock market, it\u2019s hard to know for sure, but there are a bunch of things that could be worrying investors right now.\n\nFirst, China. The global economy has shuddered recently on a string of troubling economic updates from the Middle Kingdom. Last week, after two decades of keeping a firm grip on the currency, China\u2019s central bank allowed the yuan to fall a striking 4.4 percent. The move was widely interpreted as a bid to prop up exports, which plummeted a significantly worse-than-expected 8.3 percent in July\u2014the biggest drop in four months. The yuan stabilized this week as the People\u2019s Bank of China resumed setting the daily reference rate in a tight band, but the bad news kept coming. On Friday, U.S. markets awoke to data showing China\u2019s factory sector shrank faster than it had in six years in August, with decreases in both domestic and export demand. While China\u2019s official figures have touted 7 percent growth, the great investor fear is that the country\u2019s economy is actually growing much more slowly\u2014and in some provinces and regions perhaps even slipping into outright recession.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSecond, the Federal Reserve. On Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee released minutes from its July meeting. Essentially, the Fed said that the U.S. economy is on the upswing, but that inflation isn\u2019t quite there yet, and \u201calmost all members\u201d of the FOMC felt \u201cthey would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong\u201d before it would commence with the long-awaited raising of rates. For the markets, the question is always how to read these statements, and right now people are split over whether the rate-raising will come in September or a bit later. Most investors seemed to be leaning away from a September hike, but the team at Citi felt differently, writing in a note that the tone of the minutes was \u201chawkish\u201d and September remained the more likely option. Honestly, we\u2019ve been waiting for the Fed to raise rates for so long by now that you\u2019d expect markets to have priced it in, but apparently that\u2019s just not the case.

{"entityId": 162, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images\n\nMost of the time, when we talk about immigration, we\u2019re talking about Latin America. Donald Trump isn\u2019t threatening to round up Irish immigrants in Boston who entered the country illegally or to build a wall between us and Canada; he\u2019s threatening Latinos and tapping into an ugly strain of racist nativism. It\u2019s why \u201canchor baby\u201d\u2014slang for the American-born children of unauthorized immigrants\u2014is such a charged term. To many, it\u2019s racial code for often brown-skinned, Spanish-speaking children.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nOf course, rhetoric aside, America\u2019s immigrant community goes beyond Latino and Hispanic Americans. It includes Africans, Europeans, and Asians, one of the fastest growing groups in the country. Not all Asians are tied to the immigrant experience\u2014more than a quarter are native-born, with long and durable ties to the United States. But the large majority are foreign-born, with roots in a variety of different countries, from China and Japan to Korea, Vietnam, India, and Bangladesh. Moreover, they\u2019re a rising share of the electorate\u2014in 1996, just 1.6 percent of voters were Asian. In 2012, it was 3.4 percent. As second- and third-generation Asian Americans take the stage in national life, that voting block will increase.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen Republicans attack immigration\u2014and increasingly, immigrants\u2014we know it alienates Hispanic and Latino voters. Indeed, between Trump and his chorus of imitators, the party has all but abandoned its outreach to that community. But in this analysis, we shouldn\u2019t ignore Asian Americans. This rhetoric matters to them too, and if Republicans aren\u2019t careful, they\u2019re set to lose two groups and likely seal their fate for next November.\n\nHow do we know that Asian voters care about immigration? Let\u2019s look back to the previous presidential election. So little of how Barack Obama won in 2012 was a surprise. He captured young voters and cleaned up with single women; he struck gold with Latinos and won the entire black vote, again; and he was weak, as expected, with most white Americans. However, there was one shock: Obama scored an enormous win among Asians. His 73 percent share of the Asian vote was a significant increase from the previous election and a bright spot in his overall performance.\n\nIt would have been one thing if, like blacks, Asians were Democratic stalwarts. But they weren\u2019t. A solid 44 percent supported George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election, and a sizable minority\u201435 percent\u2014voted for John McCain in the 2008 election. The reason is straightforward: As a whole, Asians are closer to the social and economic mainstream than other minority groups. They are the \u201chighest-income, best-educated and fastest-growing racial group in the United States,\u201d notes the Pew Research Center. \u201cThey are more satisfied than the general public with their lives, finances and the direction of the country, and they place more value than other Americans do on marriage, parenthood, hard work and career success.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Asians were primed to follow the national trend and vote a little more Republican. But they didn\u2019t. Just 26 percent voted for Mitt Romney, the lowest GOP total in 20 years. What happened? What turned a small Democratic edge into an outright advantage?\n\nAgain, the answer is immigration, and specifically, the sense of exclusion that came from the GOP. In the 2012 primary, like this one, Republicans were torn over immigration policy, with candidates having a strong incentive to oppose comprehensive reform. Throughout the primary process, candidates fought to surpass one another with draconian solutions for dealing with unauthorized immigrants, with Romney touting \u201cself-deportation\u201d in his pitch to Republican voters. He won the nomination, but the phrase was an albatross on his general election campaign. In a 2014 study, researchers at Vanderbilt University measured the impact of that rhetoric on Asian voters. How would they react to feeling excluded or questioned on their citizenship? \u201cThe simple intervention of making an Asian subject feel excluded with respect to \u2018Americanness\u2019 and being suspected of not being a U.S. citizen increased negative dispositions towards the Republican Party and increased positive views of the Democratic Party,\u201d write the authors. Put simply, when confronted with exclusionary rhetoric, Asian voters tied the Republican Party to racial discrimination.\n\nLast year, in the midterm elections, it looked like Republicans recovered from their 2012 rout with Asians. In exit polls, 50 percent voted for Democrats, versus 49 percent for Republicans. If that\u2019s accurate, then the picture isn\u2019t as bad as it seems. But there\u2019s always been a midterm swing toward Republicans, and several polls\u2014including in-language surveys from polling firm Asian American Decisions\u2014show a larger Democratic advantage than appears in that exit poll. Indeed, in its recent probe of party affiliation, Pew found an almost 3-to-1 divide among Asians: 65 percent identified with the Democratic Party, 23 percent with the GOP.\n\nStill, outreach isn\u2019t hopeless, especially in an open election year without an incumbent on the ballot. But that assumes that Republicans can get their base under control, or at least behind rhetoric that doesn\u2019t antagonize immigrant groups and those with ties to immigrant communities. This could happen, but because of Trump, it looks like a long shot. Trump isn\u2019t just popular; he\u2019s shaping Republican policy, and several candidates have even turned against birthright citizenship\u2014a historic achievement of the once\u2013party of Lincoln.\n\nMaybe this won\u2019t matter for 2016. After all, most Americans aren\u2019t paying attention to the race thus far. But that\u2019s small consolation. Democrats are watching the Republican primary. They are recording and polling and testing. Come next year, they will blanket immigrant communities with the greatest hits of Republican rhetoric, and over the course of the campaign, countless people\u2014teachers, factory workers, small business people, and others\u2014will remember the comments about \u201cillegals\u201d and \u201canchor babies.\u201d And they\u2019ll act accordingly. In turn, this will leave Republicans in a tight spot. To win without minorities, they\u2019ll have to find and mobilize even more white voters: men and women who aren\u2019t as tied to the political system, people who are angry and disaffected from their leaders. Trump supporters.\n\nOn Friday, a writer for the Federalist\u2014a conservative website\u2014asked if the GOP was the \u201cparty of freedom\u201d or the \u201cparty of white identity.\u201d If the party keeps moving on its present path, there will be no answer but the latter.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:36:08.731+0000"}

Even those who do stay abreast of current events via some form of social media generally assume that whatever nastiness they encounter online doesn\u2019t affect anything important. If there is a political impact, it\u2019s on niche movements or Islamic extremists. Jon Ronson\u2019s recent book, So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed, explores the madness of the Twitter mobs that destroy the lives of people who tell unfortunate jokes, but until now, we\u2019ve still believed that mainstream politics were safe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWatching Donald Trump bluster and bluff his way through a presidential campaign, I wonder if we underestimate the ways in which Internet vitriol has broadened the parameters of political debate. We are \u201cshocked, shocked\u201d by Trump\u2019s language, but all of it is exactly the sort of thing anyone can encounter in the normal course of reading about politics online. John McCain isn\u2019t a war hero? I\u2019ll bet he finds worse insults than that on his Facebook page, and so does everybody who writes about him. All Mexicans are rapists? I open my Twitter account every morning to find similar and worse (my personal favorite, translated from Polish: \u201cReading what that @anneapplebaum writes I understand anti-semitism. Jews have an incredible gift for pissing you off\u201d).\n\nThe language of online political discourse is now so extreme, and often so far divorced from reality, that Trump\u2019s words fit right in, especially when they make no sense. Trump\u2019s defenders\u2014and I know because they tell me so online\u2014say they admire him because he is allegedly \u201canti-establishment.\u201d They are wrong: He isn\u2019t anti-establishment at all. As a vastly wealthy man\u2014as one who can invite a former president and his then-senator wife to his wedding and expect them to come\u2014he actually lives at the very heart of a certain slice of the establishment. But of course he is different from other politicians in another sense: He is the only presidential candidate who uses, on television, the kind of language normally found in the comment section of a celebrity website or the more aggressive Reddit forums. Vulgar insults, racist slurs, manufactured \u201canger,\u201d and invented \u201cfacts\u201d are all a normal part of debate in those kinds of public spaces. Thanks to Trump, they have now migrated to presidential politics, too.\n\nAs others have noted, protest candidates are hardly a uniquely American phenomenon. Silvio Berlusconi brought the language and style of Italian tabloid television into the center of Italian politics; multiple far-right ideologues have brought anger and bombast into European debates. In Britain, the obscurantist far left is having a revival in the form of Jeremy Corbyn, a bearded Marxist\u2014he favors the nationalization of industry and nuclear disarmament\u2014who may well be the next leader of the Labour Party. All of these candidates appeal to electorates who have strong online ties but don\u2019t hear their views reflected in mainstream politics. Trump falls into that category, too. But instead of the far left or the far right, he speaks for the sarcastic hate-tweeters, the anti-everything nihilists, and the conspiracy theorists who write convoluted anonymous comments at the bottom of newspaper articles.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:36:19.232+0000"}

{"entityId": 165, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nThe term \u201canchor babies\u201d has once again reared its ugly head this election season, spouting from the mouths of not just say-whatever Donald Trump but also I\u2019m-my-own-man Jeb Bush and son-of-immigrants Bobby Jindal.\n\nIt\u2019s shorthand for the idea that immigrant women purposefully and illegally come to the United States to give birth to their children, thus securing citizenship for their kids and perhaps also a chance to stay in the country themselves (even though in reality they can easily be deported). It gets thrown around whenever conservatives want to question the 14th Amendment guaranteeing citizenship to babies born on American soil.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe phrase, which turns a newborn into dead weight dropped like mooring, implies that these mothers are simply using their pregnancies as vehicles for their own desires. It dehumanizes them. They are transformed from mothers who want to bring life into the world to cherish and nurture it into creatures that use their own offspring to get what they want.\n\nThis dehumanization isn\u2019t terribly uncommon, unfortunately. In fact it\u2019s the way we often discuss the actions and choices that poor women and women of color make as mothers. We can\u2019t pretend that using the term anchor babies is a one-off; it\u2019s part of the fundamental way we both talk about and legislate the lives of poor women.\n\nIt\u2019s particularly true when these actions are mere hypotheses with no data or evidence to show that women are actually making these choices. Anchor babies fall into this category. While some immigrants do come to the United States to give birth, they tend to be more affluent, arriving here as tourists with proper legal documents. Children born to undocumented parents make up a tiny slice of all American children. And if a mother comes to the U.S. to give birth in hopes of getting citizenship for herself, she\u2019ll have to wait until her child is 21 and can petition for it.\n\nAnother dreamed-up bugaboo has recently popped up: poor mothers who deliberately poison their children to get housing. Maryland\u2019s housing secretary warned a convention audience last week about a mother putting lead fishing weights in her child\u2019s mouth, taking the child in for lead testing, and getting a free place to live at her landlord\u2019s expense until the kid turns 18. When pressed, he said that he had no evidence of this ever taking place, but that \u201cThis is an anecdotal story that was described to me as something that could possibly happen.\u201d\n\nThe poisonous mother is even more depraved than the mother trying to drop her anchor baby. This mother\u2019s lead anchor roots her in a house, but her actions could kill her child or leave him physically or mentally impaired. Most people would barely recognize someone like that as human. But a poor woman\u2019s poverty is assumed to make her act in barbaric, unthinkable ways to get what she needs. She doesn\u2019t view her own children with the devotion and delight that we expect from any other parents. She is something other.\n\nIt\u2019s a trope that\u2019s been with us for some time. It dates at least as far back as the welfare queen, the mythical poor woman who defrauds the government out of anti-poverty funding rather than put in a hard day\u2019s work. She started out as a real woman who stood trial for fraud in the 1970s. But she\u2019s come to mean far more than that, standing in for a poor, usually black woman who has lots of children out of wedlock in order to get more government money.\n\nThis image took hold so strongly that it worked its way into legislation. After welfare reform passed in the 1990s and states were given wide authority to change their programs, many instituted welfare caps that cut poor mothers off of additional benefits after they have more than a certain number of children while enrolled. The caps have their origin in the House Republicans\u2019 1994 Contract With America, which called for \u201cdenying increased [benefits] for additional children while on welfare \u2026 to promote individual personal responsibility.\u201d Others at the time more explicitly tied the caps to the idea that poor mothers were having extra babies just so they could get extra cash. The welfare queen, then, decided to add more people to her family not out of love and joy, but to cash them in like poker chips.\n\nThe legacy of this view remains with us today. Sixteen states give a family no extra money to care for additional children after a certain number. Yet welfare queens look nothing like reality for the people who receive public assistance. They have the same average family size as families who don\u2019t need public benefits to get by. And there\u2019s no evidence the caps work as intended.\n\nThese fantasies about poor mothers and women of color that treat them as some other species of human work their way into legislation in other ways. The Maryland housing official who warned against mothers poisoning children told the story to promote limits he wants to place on the liability landlords can face in lead paint cases. And of course anchor babies are doing important work for conservatives trying to make a case to end birthright citizenship, enshrined in the Constitution.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:36:35.533+0000"}

New questions will be marked with the date that they are added.\n\nWhat\u2019s the latest with Hillary and the whole email thing?\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHillary Clinton brought a press conference to an abrupt end on Tuesday after yet another combative exchange about her use of a private email server while secretary of state. As she was walking toward the exit, a reporter shouted one final question about the controversy, this time about its staying power. A clearly exasperated Clinton, still moving toward the door, tossed up her hands. \u201cNobody talks to me about it,\u201d she shouted back, \u201cother than you guys.\u201d\n\nI probably wouldn\u2019t talk to her about it either, mostly because this story has been dragging on for so long I don\u2019t even remember how it started. How\u2019d we even get here?\n\nFor the four years she was secretary of state, Clinton never used an official state.gov email address. Instead, she relied exclusively on a private email account housed on her own personal server to conduct her government business. Those facts went unnoticed\u2014or at least unaddressed\u2014by the State Department until this past summer, when agency officials were responding to a request for documents from congressional investigators and realized they couldn\u2019t find a single email to or from a Clinton government email address.\n\nSo then what happened?\n\nAfter a specific request from the State Department\u2014that came nearly two years after she had left office\u2014Clinton turned over 30,490 messages to the agency that she and her team deemed to be possibly work-related. Clinton and her staff, though, say they also destroyed 31,830 messages that they decided were personal. The private server was then subsequently wiped clean.\n\nAnd how did everyone else find this out?\n\nHillary\u2019s unorthodox, nongovernmental email setup was revealed to the public by the New York Times in March of this year in a report that prompted the major controversy that still hangs over her presidential campaign and will for the foreseeable future.\n\nRemind me, what was her excuse for using a private email account in the first place?\n\nHillary and her team have offered a number of lawyerly and convoluted justifications, but her explanation ultimately boils down to what she says was a simple a matter of convenience: She didn\u2019t want to carry two smartphones, which she says would have been necessary at the time since State Department policy didn\u2019t allow her to have multiple email addresses on a government-issued BlackBerry. As a result, she decided to send work emails on a personal account as opposed to personal emails on a work one.\n\nIs that \u2026 believable?\n\nThat probably depends on where you\u2019re sitting. But it would sound much more believable if Clinton hadn\u2019t described herself earlier this year as \u201ctwo steps short of a hoarder\u201d who lugs around a BlackBerry, an iPhone, an iPad, and an iPad Mini in her purse, and similarly made it clear at a 2011 State Department event that she doesn\u2019t exactly travel light.\n\nAn iPad and an iPad Mini? Well, that doesn\u2019t sound convenient at all.\n\nNeither does going through the trouble of purchasing your own Web domain, which a longtime aide to her husband did for her on the first day of her confirmation hearings in 2009; nor setting up and maintaining a personal server in your home, which someone did for her in Chappaqua, New York, as she was preparing to start work at the State Department.\n\nOK, but was any of that actually illegal?\n\nIn a word: no.\n\nHow about a few more?\n\nIf Secretary John Kerry did today what Clinton did, it would run afoul of the current laws on the books, which require government officials to copy or forward work email sent or received on a private account to their government account within 20 days. Hillary\u2019s email use, though, does not appear to have violated any of the laws that were in place when she was in office\u2014even though it did clearly fall well short of the Obama administration\u2019s preferred best practices and was also explicitly discouraged by the State Department.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t break any specific law, though, then what\u2019s the big deal?\n\nClinton does not appear to have violated the letter of the law but she did ignore the spirit of it when she went out of her way to create a system that gave her unprecedented control over what could become public. Hillary\u2019s private email account and server effectively shielded her messages from Freedom of Information Act requests, congressional subpoenas, and other searches.\n\nBut why does the government even need to keep her emails?\n\nThe federal government routinely archives official records so it can provide an accurate and comprehensive account of administrative decision-making\u2014for the government, for the courts, and for the American public. The government can\u2019t keep records it doesn\u2019t have. It\u2019s inconceivable that Hillary did not know this.\n\nWouldn\u2019t those emails already be in the system given many of them were sent to or from people who had their own government accounts?\n\nThat\u2019s what Clinton\u2019s team has argued. That, however, relies on her colleagues using the same type of .gov address that she herself avoided\u2014something we have every reason to suspect some of them didn\u2019t do. At least one of her top aides, Huma Abedin, is known to have had her own clintonemail.com address, making it difficult to believe that all of Clinton\u2019s government business was logged on government servers. That defense also conveniently ignores any emails Clinton may have exchanged with foreign leaders or private parties outside the U.S. government.\n\nBut since she\u2019s now turned all those emails over, everything\u2019s OK? Better late than never, right?\n\nRemember: Clinton says she deleted 31,830 emails. Since Clinton and her team decided for themselves which messages to turn over and which ones to delete\u2014and since they\u2019ve never fully explained how such decisions were made\u2014there\u2019s no way to know with any certainty that everything erased was actually OK to erase.\n\nAlready, it\u2019s clear that the self-sorting process was, at best, an imperfect one. In June, for example, the State Department said that more than a dozen Libya-related messages that former aide Sidney Blumenthal had sent to Clinton were unaccounted for in the trove she turned over to the agency. We know those emails exist at all only because Blumenthal, a longtime friend of the Clintons, had already turned over his copies of them to the congressional panel investigating Benghazi. We have no way of knowing whether they were deleted intentionally by Clinton or simply slipped through the cracks during the sorting process.\n\nSo is this just a transparency and trust issue?\n\nIt began that way. But a story about Clinton appearing to seek out a legal gray area from which to do business has since become one about her putting classified information at greater risk than it needed to be.\n\nWait, I thought Clinton once said she never sent or received classified information with this account?\n\nDuring her first public comments about the controversy back in March, Clinton was adamant that no classified information of any kind was kept on her account or server: \u201cThere is no classified material.\u201d That stance, though, has been subtly but significantly changing as more information comes to light. Late last month Clinton revised her answer to: \u201cI did not send nor receive anything that was classified at the time.\u201d And then on Tuesday it shifted again, to: \u201cI did not send any material that was marked or designated classified.\u201d\n\nWhy the change?\n\nThe inclusion of \u201cat the time\u201d allows for the possibility that information she sent or received was classified after the fact. The \u201cmarked or designated\u201d tweak allows for the possibility that someone sent her classified information without properly marking it as so, and that Clinton then passed along that information without knowing it was sensitive.\n\nHold up. I forget why it\u2019s bad for her to have classified information on her personal server.\n\nThe biggest concern is that it put that information at greater risk of being hacked into than if she would have simply relied on a secured government account. (There\u2019s no evidence that anyone was able to hack into her account or gain access to that information.)\n\nSo is Clinton now basically admitting that there was classified info on her server?\n\nIn a word: yes.\n\nHow about a few more?\n\nThere is no longer any doubt that Clinton sent or received information that is classified today. When the State Department publicly released roughly 300 Benghazi-related emails that came from her personal account earlier this year, one was classified \u201csecret\u201d and the information was withheld at the FBI\u2019s request. Subsequent court-ordered releases of Clinton\u2019s emails have included roughly 60 messages that were marked \u201cconfidential\u201d in order to protect diplomatic secrets.\n\nWhy is the court ordering that her emails be released?\n\nJournalists, advocacy groups, and other interested parties have filed numerous Freedom of Information Act requests in relation to Clinton\u2019s emails, the bulk of which are public records. The State Department had originally proposed releasing Clinton\u2019s messages (minus any classified info that would need to be redacted) to the public all at once in January 2016 after the entire archive had been reviewed. A federal judge, though, spiked that plan and instead ordered that the department release the emails in monthly batches as they\u2019re cleared.\n\nOk, so back to the classified emails. What type of \u201cclassified\u201d information are we talking about?\n\nSince classified information is by definition classified, the public will likely never have the chance to judge for themselves just how sensitive the information in question was. And as Jeffrey Toobin explains in the New Yorker, while classified information is generally defined as anything with the potential to damage national security, in reality, \u201cgovernment bureaucracies use classification rules to protect turf, to avoid embarrassment, to embarrass rivals\u2014in short, for a variety of motives that have little to do with national security.\u201d\n\nSo is it really Clinton\u2019s fault if all that info was classified after the fact?\n\nClinton\u2019s team argues that since the process by which the government classifies information is a complicated and subjective one, it is impossible for someone to know today what will be classified tomorrow, and even whether it should be classified at all. That\u2019s a point well worth making. But as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, Clinton should still have been well aware that some of the information she was hosting on her server was sensitive and would potentially end up classified even before it was officially ruled as such. Put another way, Hillary might not have known which information would become classified but she should have known some of it eventually would be.\n\nIs there anything to suggest that Clinton sent or received sensitive information that was classified at the time?\n\nYes. After taking a close look at a small sample of about 40 of Clinton\u2019s work emails to or from her personal account, a pair of government investigators warned late last month that they\u2019d found what they said were several intelligence secrets, at least two of which they believe should have been marked as \u201ctop secret\u201d but weren\u2019t. The information, the investigators said, is classified now and was likewise back when it was sent. \u201cThis classified information never should have been transmitted via an unclassified personal system,\u201d the inspectors general for the State Department and for the intelligence community said in a statement.\n\nThat sounds pretty bad.\n\nIt\u2019s not good! It is illegal for someone to \u201cknowingly\u201d receive a classified document or briefing and then turn around and send along that info in an unclassified email. Still, the inspectors general did not specify whether Clinton sent or received the information in question. And, from what we know about how Hillary emails, it\u2019s certainly believable that she was on the receiving end, as her campaign has argued is likely the case. If it\u2019s true that Clinton only received the info\u2014or that, at worst, she forwarded it along without knowing it was classified\u2014then she would have a compelling legal defense thanks to the intent requirement in the law.\n\nAdded Aug. 21: Is there any other evidence that Hillary sent or received information that was classified at the time she sent it?\n\nYes. Reuters did a close reading of some of Clinton's emails that the State Department has since stamped \"classified\" and found that those new stamps\u2014which include data suggesting the nature of the classification\u2014suggest that those messages may have contained information that, under State Department rules, should have always been considered classified even before it was marked that way. According to a former director of the U.S. government's Information Security Oversight Office, such information is \"born classified.\"\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nRepublicans, journalists, and anyone else with an interest will continue to comb through her emails as they are made public. More importantly: Based on the inspector general referral, the FBI has launched a security review into Clinton\u2019s email account and server. The Justice Department has stressed that\u2014contrary to early and erroneous reports by the New York Times\u2014the investigation is neither \u201ccriminal\u201d nor focused specifically on Clinton. FBI investigators will now take a closer look at the private server\u2014along with several thumb drives Clinton\u2019s lawyer turned over that contain copies of her work emails\u2014in hopes of determining where any classified information came from, and to determine if anyone ever tried to hack into Clinton\u2019s account.\n\nWhere is the server now?\n\nThere have been several unconfirmed and apparently erroneous bathroom-related reports of where the server has been kept since Clinton left office. But according to Platte River, the Denver-based IT firm hired by Clinton, the server was moved to a data center in New Jersey in the summer of 2013, where it remained until Hillary agreed to turn it over to the FBI last week.\n\nWait, I thought Clinton deleted everything from the server. What can they learn from looking at an empty server?\n\nClinton\u2019s lawyer has said that the server was wiped clean, a specific term used to suggest that not only were all the emails deleted but the server\u2019s hard drive was also overwritten to prevent the files from being recovered. Such a process makes it difficult to recover the files and other data, but not impossible, and NBC News reports that the FBI is hopeful it may still be able to glean additional information from the server about the emails and its security.\n\nWhoa. Doesn\u2019t the fact that Clinton had someone \u201cwipe\u201d the server suggest wrongdoing?\n\nNot necessarily. Hillary has argued that \u201cmy personal emails are my personal business\u201d and believes she did nothing wrong by deleting them. If you buy that (and buy that the only emails deleted were purely personal ones), then it stands to reason that she also did nothing wrong by attempting to ensure that they were deleted for good. Of course, if you think Hillary was wrong to do the sorting herself, then attempting to ensure no one else will get a chance to double-check her work will raise a giant red flag.\n\nDo voters actually care?\n\nClinton maintains that the only reason this is a story is because Republicans are eager to destroy her presidential bid and the political press corps is predisposed to scandal, and that no voters she talks to ever bring it up. That last part may be true given Clinton has relatively little unscripted interaction with voters, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that many Americans believe there is fire underneath all this smoke. In a recent CNN survey, 63 percent of self-described independents and even 30 percent of Democrats said Clinton did something wrong by using a private email account and server.\n\nBut will it cost her the election?\n\nThat\u2019s a different story. The email controversy gives Republicans a golden opportunity to highlight Clinton\u2019s least appealing qualities in the eyes of voters, namely her general secrecy and evasiveness. But as my colleague Jamelle Bouie has already explained, while it might mar her campaign, it\u2019s unlikely to end it on its own given everything else she has working in her favor. Meanwhile, as FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Nate Silver has argued, given Clinton\u2019s track record, it was only a matter of time before some scandal\u2014whether perceived or real\u2014began to drag down her favorability ratings. If it weren\u2019t this, it would have been something else.\n\nSo how does this story end?\n\nSlowly. The court-ordered monthly release of 30,000-odd emails ensures a steady drip-drip-drip of unfavorable coverage for the Democratic front-runner. Justice Department officials and congressional investigators, meanwhile, have already proved more than happy to leak incomplete info about the investigation, meaning there will be many more email-related questions before we have any definitive answers.\n\nWhat exactly are the answers we\u2019re looking for?\n\nThere are the ones we want but will likely never get: Did Clinton deliberately delete any work-related emails? Did she knowingly send classified information over her personal email? Did she intentionally use her private email account to operate without oversight? And there are the ones we might yet discover: Was any of the classified information on Clinton\u2019s server classified at the time she sent it? Who, if anyone, gave her the green light to use a private email system? Was her account the subject of a hacking attempt, successful or otherwise?\n\nDoes any of this have anything to do with Benghazi?\n\nYes. The discovery of Clinton\u2019s personal email account can be traced back to the GOP-led House panel investigating the attack at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. It was that panel\u2019s request for Hillary\u2019s email that set this whole thing in motion, and committee Chairman Trey Gowdy\u2019s efforts that have helped fan the flames.\n\nClinton says she plans to testify before the Benghazi panel in late October, which all but guarantees a high-profile clash with Gowdy, who has emerged as one of her most vocal critics in Washington. But while the hearing is likely to produce plenty of partisan fireworks, it\u2019s unclear whether Gowdy\u2019s offense or Clinton\u2019s defense will be enough to change voters\u2019 minds about a woman and presidential candidate most have already made up their minds about.\n\nSorry, last thing: What actually happened in Benghazi?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:37:08.655+0000"}

This might seem a less-than-noteworthy development. One assumes Trump wore the hat mostly just to corral his cotton-candy hair on a windy day. Yet the online reaction was swift and torrential.\n\nSome wondered why a man worth more than TEN BILLION DOLLARS chose a hat that looked to cost about $5.99. Many others, meanwhile, wondered where they could buy one for themselves. The Trump campaign store in Manhattan sold out of the hat within hours, and his website scrambled to make them available for order. One online retailer rushed to fill the void with a line of knockoffs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhy did the donning of casual headwear become a subject of national fascination? It helps that The Donald is piping hot at the moment, a figure who spurs endless curiosity. Everything he touches turns to tweets. And oh, that photo: the pursed-lipped, squinty-eyed Trump frowning under his new chapeau. Juxtapose almost anything with Trump\u2019s sour puss, and you\u2019ve got yourself an indelible image.\n\nBut the fuss was in large part about the hat qua hat. Its text, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d\u2014a shameless rip-off of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980 campaign slogan \u201cLet\u2019s Make America Great Again.\u201d (Note how Trump tweaks it to be both less inclusive and more bossy.) The hat\u2019s foamy front\u2014apparently made from a repurposed beer koozie. The double divots framing the central peak. And of course the braided rope that elegantly stretched across its brim.\n\nThe \u201crope hat\u201d style is on trend these days. Gnarly skateboard periodical Thrasher Magazine sells them in several colors, highlighting\u2014in rather Trumpian language\u2014the \u201cclassy woven rope\u201d that distinguishes its design. Urban Outfitters offers a circa 1992 Wu-Tang rope hat. Vintage rope hats routinely show up on Etsy. In June, a bit more than a month before Trump wore one for the cameras, Golf Digest asked, \u201cAre rope hats back to being cool?\u201d after one appeared atop the head of 26-year-old PGA tour pro Harris English. This was no mere trucker hat. The rope is a distinctive touch.\n\nThe hat is random and startling, and so is the Donald.\n\nThere\u2019s a fine line here between retro chic and just, like, dorky 9-hole golf course wear. But Trump manages to walk this tightrope with ease. He\u2019s got that quirky, aging rich guy cool\u2014the same kind that turned grandfatherly, 74-year-old Patriots owner Robert Kraft\u2019s fetish for Nike Lunar Force 1 sneakers into a minisensation in New England last year.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the matter of the hat\u2019s lettering. Rendering Trump\u2019s slogan in all caps may actually reduce its legibility, since the lack of shape contrast slows down readers. But so what? \u201cDonald Trump is an all-caps kind of guy,\u201d says Steven Heller. Heller, co-chair of the MFA in design at New York\u2019s School of Visual Arts, recently analyzed Trump\u2019s typography choices for Wired\u2014beginning with the giant, brass-colored, \u201cTRUMP TOWER\u201d sign over the entry of Trump\u2019s flagship Fifth Avenue building. Heller notes that the sign\u2019s typeface, a slab serif style that is likely either Stymie Bold or Lubalin Graph, is very similar to the one Playboy used for its gentlemen\u2019s clubs in the 1960s. Classy. Luxurious. Heller authored Iron Fists: Branding the 20th-Century Totalitarian State, so he is an authority when he describes the all-caps, chunky serif aesthetic of the hat as \u201cimperial.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a hat on sale in the Hillary campaign shop that nicely highlights the differences between the two candidates. The Hillary hat has a complicated stitching pattern and colorful underbrim and looks like it was lovingly designed by professional milliners. I\u2019ve repeatedly asked the Trump campaign for their hat\u2019s origin story, and they\u2019ve not yet gotten back to me with an answer, but to my eyes the Trump hat looks to have been thrown together last-second by a frazzled intern. Which seems par for the course. Everything about Hillary screams \u201ccareful preparation\u201d while everything about Trump screams \u201cwinging it.\u201d\n\nJerry McLaughlin, co-founder of Branders.com, spent 15 years making merchandise for political campaigns. In his eyes, the purpose of all this swag is not for the campaign to make money. \u201cGenerally, they might end up making a few bucks,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this is not a meaningful source of revenue for them. It\u2019s not a commercial enterprise. It\u2019s more, \u2018Let\u2019s not lose money doing this.\u2019 \u201d Even the Obama campaign\u2019s reported $40 million revenue from its high-fashion 2012 merchandise line was a drop in the bucket, to McLaughlin\u2019s thinking. \u201cIt\u2019s still small numbers compared to the billion dollars it takes to run a presidential campaign.\u201d And that\u2019s when you have Anna Wintour shaping your products.\n\nSurprisingly, McLaughlin doesn\u2019t even consider campaign merch a form of advertising. He doesn\u2019t think seeing a Hillary hat on someone else\u2019s head will turn you into a Hillary voter. \u201cIt\u2019s more that it cements the wearer closely to the candidate,\u201d he argues. \u201cI wear your hat and, because I\u2019ve announced publicly my affiliation with you, I find myself more committed.

For example, I\u2019m an Asian American, a South Asian American, a person of eastern Bengali descent, and a Brooklyn Nets fan. Though I\u2019m not religiously observant, the Islamic religious tradition was an important part of my upbringing, and it\u2019s drawn me closer to the views of orthodox Christians and Jews on more than a few social issues. I\u2019m a free-market enthusiast who believes in the safety net, and I\u2019m an urban-dwelling nondriver who\u2019d like to cut the federal tax on gasoline. Like most people, including most people of color, I embrace a mishmash of identities and I have lots of half-baked, contradictory views. Because of the magazines I read and the ZIP code in which I live, I\u2019m the kind of voter a conservative candidate might easily overlook. But the issues that matter most to me place me on the right, and I\u2019m guessing that there are other misfits who might be willing to vote as I do if the right candidate were to make the right pitch.\n\nRepublicans need to start chasing the voters I think of as my fellow ethnic contrarians\u2014the blacks, Asians, Latinos, and American Indians who zag when other members of these megagroups zig. I call this strategy No Vote Left Behind. To appreciate why this strategy is so important to the GOP\u2019s hopes of winning the White House, it\u2019s helpful to understand the rising importance of the black electorate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party is not quite a majority-minority coalition. But it\u2019s closer than you might think. In the 2012 presidential election, an overwhelming 88 percent majority of Mitt Romney\u2019s vote came from non-Hispanic whites. By contrast, only 56 percent of President Obama\u2019s votes came from non-Hispanic whites, while 24 percent came from blacks and 14 percent from Latinos. Black voters turned out at a higher rate than non-Hispanic white voters in 2012, as they did in 2008. Will that be the case in 2016? For Democrats, this is a vitally important question, and it is a big part of why the party\u2019s leading presidential candidates are being forced to take the politics of racial justice very seriously. If Democrats fail to motivate black voters, and if they fail to secure the near-universal support among black voters they secured in 2012 and 2008, their candidate\u2019s path to the White House will suddenly get much narrower.\n\nRepublicans face a parallel challenge. In 2012, Romney won 59 percent of the non-Hispanic white vote. You can imagine a GOP candidate maintaining Romney\u2019s share of the white vote, or even improving upon it slightly. But increasing it by a substantial margin will be challenging, and increasing it in ways that have the side effect of further reducing Republican support among Latinos (a dismal 27 percent in 2012) or blacks (an even more dismal 6 percent) might put victory even further out of reach.\n\nThis is where the contrarians come in. Conservatives have long believed that there are many black Americans who vote for Democrats in presidential elections despite holding conservative positions on issues like abortion, gun rights, and taxes. But rather than devote meaningful resources to identifying these voters and persuading them to back the GOP, conservatives have largely neglected them. When Republicans have reached out to black voters in recent years, they\u2019ve often done so by focusing on an issue like criminal justice reform, as in the case of Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul. Whatever the merits of criminal justice reform, however, it is not obvious that black voters who consider it their top priority will ever be inclined to back Republicans. Embracing criminal justice reform might be worthwhile on its own terms, but it is foolish to think of it as a linchpin of black outreach.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:37:26.403+0000"}

Of course, there are very good reasons why the government uses that measure. Many people, such as stay-at-home parents, students, retirees, the disabled, and the occasional trust-fund kid, simply choose not to work, and their lack of gainful employment isn't really a reflection of the labor market's health.

{"entityId": 179, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nOn Wednesday six GOP candidates for president\u2014Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, John Kasich, Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, and Chris Christie\u2014sat on a stage in a Londonderry, New Hampshire, high school to talk K\u201312 education policy with former CNN anchor-turned-\u201ceducation activist\u201d Campbell Brown. The New Hampshire Education Summit, sponsored by the school choice advocacy organization the American Federation for Children and hosted by Brown\u2019s glossy new school-reform website, the Seventy Four (both, it is safe to say, are sympathetic to right-leaning education proposals currently in vogue), gave the six GOP candidates who showed up 45-plus minutes each to expound their views on K\u201312 education. The result was a daylong school-choice lovefest. Here\u2019s what the candidates covered (hint: race, class, and poverty seldom made the cut).\n\nJeb Bush\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe opening act was former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who was far more comfortable and commanding than at the Republican candidates debate two weeks ago*. Bush, the (dubiously) self-proclaimed \u201ceducation governor,\u201d has well-known views on education, and he didn\u2019t deviate from the formula much. He supports vouchers, which he claims didn\u2019t \u201cdestroy public education\u2014that\u2019s a myth that was shattered by Florida,\u201d and the general marketplace-driven competition of the charter movement: \u201cThe public schools have to get better or they close. This is America.\u201d\n\nWhen Brown veered to Common Core, Bush joked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d before coming out in veiled support of some form of state-derived standards (which are the same thing as the Common Core standards, since governors derived them). \u201cWe can\u2019t keep dumbing down standards,\u201d he said, then reminisced about his Spanish AP teacher at Andover who, in forcing him to read Cervantes and Borges his sophomore year, taught him that \u201chigh expectations matter.\u201d\n\nBush also loves the \u201cnerdy concept\u201d of Title I portability that lets free- and reduced-meals students take their Title I dollars to the school of their choice. When asked about his pick for secretary of education, Bush gestured at his interviewer\u2014a good indication of the tenor of hard-hitting conversation that Brown would be leading throughout the day. Bush also doubled down on his support for keeping the federal testing schedule in place and endorsed more federal money going to pay for privately run pre-K programs.\n\nCarly Fiorina\n\nCarly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, kicked it off with some nice bromides about every child having \u201cvast potential.\u201d Without mentioning race or poverty, she pointed out that \u201cdisparity gaps\u201d in education are getting worse despite our ever-rising financial investments in it, which to her proves that there is no correlation between money and educational outcomes; one of her first big applause lines was \u201cwe know factually speaking that when Washington spends more money, the quality of education in this country does not improve.\u201d The Department of Education is obviously to blame: \u201cWhen was the last time anyone did an audit of the Department of Education?\u201d she asked at one point. (Answer: The department is audited every year.)\n\nSo bureaucracy is bad, and\u2014drumroll, please\u2014so is the Common Core. \u201cCommon Core,\u201d Fiorina said, \u201cmay have started out as a set of standards but what it\u2019s turned into is a program that, honestly, is being overly influenced by companies that have something to gain\u2014testing companies and textbook companies.\u201d\n\nBetween fond reminiscences of her childhood teachers, one of whom used to throw erasers lovingly at the back wall of the classroom, Fiorina took several opportunities to slam teachers\u2019 unions: \u201cWe need to reward excellence. Unions reward seniority. That discourages excellence.\u201d No big shocker there. And Fiorina is so in favor of putting accountability in the hands of parents that she offered support for the opt-out testing movement. (Last week, she aired similar views on opting out of vaccinations.)\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nEvery time Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2014tieless and strenuously California business casual on Wednesday\u2014takes the stage, I think, \u201cWow, if the Republicans weren\u2019t too insane right now to notice, this guy could really be president.\u201d Kasich doesn\u2019t let anyone forget that he\u2019s in charge of a crucial swing state, where, he claims, he\u2019s gotten \u201c85 to 90 percent of everything we wanted\u201d in education, like vouchers galore and improvements in troubled systems in Cleveland and Youngstown.\n\nHe likes charters (who at this forum doesn\u2019t?) but was quick to say that the failing ones should be closed, and remained staunch on his support for Common Core standards. Show him a good reason to ditch them and he\u2019ll consider it, but, Kasich said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to change my position because there are four people in the front row yelling at me.\u201d\n\nOne weird note in an otherwise respectful conversation occurred when Kasich said, \u201cIf I were not president, but if I were King of America, I would abolish all teacher's lounges, where they sit together and worry about \u2018woe is us.\u2019 \u201d After that out-of-nowhere stab (earlier in his speech, Kasich had acknowledged successfully collaborating with teachers\u2019 unions in rebuilding Cleveland\u2019s schools), Kasich ended by echoing a nod to God he\u2019d made earlier in the forum: \u201cI believe the Lord watches what we do with our children. And the more we dedicate ourselves to having those children rise, and to use their great brains to help heal this world and bring justice, the happier He is.\u201d Er ... OK?\n\nScott Walker\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker surely accepted Brown\u2019s invitation with alacrity, for it gave him a chance to refashion his famous union-busting passions as a noble fight for education reform. After all, that\u2019s what ending collective bargaining in Wisconsin was all about, right? Walker loves teachers; that\u2019s why he dissolved their unions, to protect the best of them from damaging union policies like \u201clast hired, first fired.\u201d And the teachers are grateful to him! \u201cI can tell when a teacher is supportive of what I\u2019ve done,\u201d Walker said, \u201cbecause they lean into me, look both ways and whisper, \u2018Thank you.\u2019 \u201d\n\nLike most of the candidates, Walker borrows the language of the marketplace to talk about the benefit of school choice: Vouchers and charters (which succeed because they can get around the \u201cnuances of contracts\u201d) force all schools to \u201cup their game,\u201d because that\u2019s how capitalism works. At one point, Walker even held up a dollar bill and asked, \u201cWhere would you rather spend this? In Washington or your local school?\u201d Like teachers unions, the federal government is just another \u201cbarrier\u201d to a good education, which is why Walker doesn\u2019t think it should have a role in accountability: \u201cI don\u2019t think the president is responsible for holding governors accountable,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI believe the people are responsible.\u201d\n\nWhat struck me most about the often stiff, stony Walker was his self-assurance and liveliness when talking about these issues\u2014but then they're at the core of his worldview, after all. He displayed actual animation on numerous subjects, including the role of technology in kids\u2019 lives. \u201cMy son Matthew can tie a bow tie much better than I can because he learned it on YouTube,\u201d he said with a laugh.\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was another unexpectedly energetic speaker on the subject of K\u201312 education in his state. He began by talking about next week\u2019s 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina and how it revolutionized the education system of New Orleans. \"It is hard to overstate how bad our public school system was,\u201d Jindal said. \u201cAnd it was expensive.\u201d But now New Orleans, the only \u201c100% choice\u201d city in the country, is the shining beacon of why education reform works: Pre-Katrina, Jindal said, 60 percent of kids were in failing schools; now it\u2019s only 10 percent.\n\nThough he was a bit shakier when it came to policy details for the rest of Louisiana, Jindal didn\u2019t back down from his repudiation of Common Core: \u201cI like the concept of what I thought Common Core was going to be\u201d was the most he\u2019d allow of his past support. He then told his favorite story about how his son\u2019s experience applying, or failing to apply, a labyrinthine method to simple arithmetic. Here, for once, Brown pushed back, saying that her son\u2019s Common Core-aligned Singapore math homework \u201cfascinated\u201d her.\n\nBut nope, Jindal wasn\u2019t buying it. Unlike the \u201celites\u201d who want to mandate how many Big Gulps New Yorkers consume in a day, he pretty wants much the federal government out of the classroom. Writing massive checks to states is fine, but otherwise, the feds should get out and stay out.\n\nChris Christie\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has no intention of backing down from his controversial wish, proclaimed earlier this month, to punch teachers unions in the face. Au contraire: Christie began his confab with Brown by digging in on the statement, saying that unions \u201care punching us all the time. They deserve it back.\u201d\n\nBut then, in a departure, the pugnacious governor described how he\u2014unlike President George W. Bush\u2014worked with Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, on spending (or squandering, depending on your perspective) Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s $100 million donation to the Newark schools. \u201cI didn\u2019t like [working with Weingarten], but I did it,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nChristie also stood his ground on his about-face on Common Core, which he repudiated, he said, not for political reasons but because \u201cthree constituencies\u201d\u2014teachers, parents, and students\u2014hated it. \u201cWhen something doesn\u2019t work that we try, we then have to change it.\u201d\n\nBut even more so than when he was condemning teachers unions, Christie became most jazzed when describing his technological pipe dreams for education. Instead of weighing themselves down with all those hefty textbooks, every child in America should get an iPad! And banish blackboards\u2014Smart Boards only FTW! Exactly how many Mark Zuckerbergs would it take to bankroll that one?", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:38:09.738+0000"}

Photos courtesy of Durham Police Department and Durham County Sheriff's Office.\n\nOn Dec. 18, 2012, in Durham, North Carolina, police officer Kelly Stewart pulled over Carlos Antonio Riley for a routine traffic stop. What happened next is a matter of intense dispute. Riley, who is black, says the officer racially profiled him then attacked him. Stewart, who is also black, says Riley engaged him in a violent, physical struggle. The encounter ended when Stewart accidentally shot himself in the leg with his firearm. Soon after, the police department logged the gun\u2019s discharge: \u201c1 shot fired by officer.\u201d\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nDistrict Attorney Roger Echols, working closely with the police department, then launched a criminal case against Riley\u2014claiming that Riley shot Stewart with Stewart\u2019s gun. The DA kept mounds of evidence away from the jury that proved Stewart shot himself. And he pressed his case against Riley all the way to trial, where Stewart testified, under oath, that he did not shoot his gun.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, a jury acquitted Riley of shooting Stewart, bringing a just end to a deeply troubling story. During the trial, defense attorney Alex Charns repeatedly described the prosecution\u2019s strategy as \u201ca shell game, a cover up, and a railroad.\u201d Examining the evidence, it is nearly impossible to come to any other conclusion.\n\nFrom the start, Stewart\u2019s attempt to detain Riley looked like bad policing. Stewart was driving an unmarked vehicle and dressed in plainclothes when he pulled Riley over\u2014for \u201cfishtailing\u201d down the road, he alleges. Riley says he was pulled over for driving while black. Stewart claims the car slid forward during the stop, and he dove in to grab the emergency brake. Riley claims the officer pulled out his gun and screamed, \u201cGet back, I\u2019m gonna fucking shoot you!\u201d At one point, Stewart claimed he was standing outside the car during the fight. Later, he claimed Riley wrestled him onto his back in the passenger seat then climbed on top of him.\n\nBoth men agree about what happened at the end of the encounter: One bullet was fired from Stewart\u2019s gun into Stewart\u2019s leg. The officer made a quick recovery. Riley was sent to prison.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear when the police department decided to assert that Riley shot Stewart, bringing in the DA to prosecute what had theretofore been treated as an accident. But it certainly didn\u2019t happen immediately. Ninety-five minutes after the shooting, an official at the department filled out a gunshot residue analysis information form, which plainly declared that the officer\u2014not the suspect\u2014fired the shot. On the day of the shooting, Stewart appears to have acknowledged that he fired his own gun.\n\nDocument via Durham Police Department\n\nBut by the time the case went to trial, Stewart\u2019s story had changed, and no officers came forward to contradict it. Now Stewart alleged that his finger was off the trigger when the gun went off. In his new memory of the altercation, Stewart testified that Riley brutally beat him after he pulled the car\u2019s emergency brake. (An emergency medical services witness said Stewart had no injuries that would indicate a physical assault\u2014no bruising, cuts, or blood.) Stewart alleged that Riley then grasped the muzzle of his gun, turned it toward the officer, and fired it.\n\nStewart alleges that he jumped into the tiny Nissan face-first and somehow wound up on his back in the passenger\u2019s seat.\n\nIf that were true, Riley\u2019s hand would have burns from grasping the hot muzzle of a smoking gun. Riley had no such burns.\n\nStewart\u2019s story had other problems. The officer claimed he pulled over Riley for swerving excessively\u2014yet, oddly, he declined to call the stop in to police communications, in violation of department policy. (Charns speculates that Stewart did not want to boost his traffic-stop statistics for blacks, which were already uncomfortably high.) Stewart also said he had to dive into Riley\u2019s car to pull the emergency brake\u2014but the brake\u2019s handle is quite large and seemingly accessible from outside the driver\u2019s door. Finally, Stewart claims Riley savagely pinned him down on his back in the passenger seat. This, however, is physically improbable. Riley\u2019s Nissan is tiny, with minimal room to maneuver. Stewart alleges that he jumped into the car face-first, somehow wound up on his back in the passenger\u2019s seat seconds later. Charns told jurors that Stewart would have to be a \u201cshape shifter\u201d to accomplish this feat.\n\nThe prosecution kept all inconvenient evidence\u2014including the critical gunshot report\u2014out of the trial. That strategy forced the defense to make a tough decision. Under North Carolina law, the defense is allowed to make the first and last closing arguments. But it loses that right if it introduces its own evidence. Charns weighed the benefit of an impassioned closing argument against the dry but revealing gunshot analysis form. He decided he would rather send the jury into deliberations after hearing his vehement closing plea.\n\nAs Charns prepared for trial, he received an unsettling surprise. Prosecutors asked for an in-chambers, off-the-record meeting\u2014and asked the judge to remove Charns as Riley\u2019s counsel. Charns, they claimed, was insufficiently informed about \u201ccriminal rules and procedures.\u201d This extremely unusual request came as a shock to Charns, a renowned attorney with 32 years of experience who specializes in police misconduct cases and criminal trials. Charns, who was appointed to the case by a public defender specifically because of his stellar qualifications, demanded that the discussion be moved to open court and put on the record. The judge denied the prosecution\u2019s request in open court before the trial began.\n\nRiley was found not guilty of assaulting Stewart by a jury of 10 men and two women. After the jury announced its verdict, Charns asked the judge to sanction the prosecution for its alleged misconduct. The judge denied the request.\n\nDurham Police Chief Jose L. Lopez Sr. released a statement on behalf of the Durham Police Department following Riley\u2019s acquittal, stating that \u201cwe\u2019re disappointed with today\u2019s verdict.\u201d The department also clarified that it \u201chas no further comment on this case.\u201d\n\nAlthough Riley has been acquitted of shooting Stewart, he will not walk free. Because Riley fled the scene with Stewart\u2019s gun, the jury convicted him of robbery. (Riley is appealing this conviction.) Moreover, Riley previously pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a felon in a separate federal prosecution centered around the same incident. (The firearm he possessed was Stewart\u2019s gun.) For that crime, Riley was sentenced to an unexpectedly severe 10 years in prison\u2014the maximum sentence he could have received for the crime.\n\nShortly after I interviewed Charns, he sent me an email telling me that someone called him, claiming to be Mark Joseph Stern, asking about the Riley case.\n\n\u201cPlease let me know if this was in fact not you who called,\u201d he wrote.\n\nI responded, confirming that it was I who called, but that I understood his concern.\n\n\u201cYou can never be too sure,\u201d I wrote.\n\nHe responded immediately.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:38:20.043+0000"}
{"entityId": 181, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Matthew Busch/Getty Images\n\nThe repeal of birthright citizenship has become a major topic of debate in the GOP presidential primary since Donald Trump released details of his immigration plan on Monday. Trump\u2019s plan includes ending the practice by which citizenship is conferred on anyone born in the United States, regardless of whether his or her parents are citizens. Now rivals, including Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, and Chris Christie, are calling for a re-examination of birthright citizenship. Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush, by contrast, have said they don\u2019t support repeal.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time birthright citizenship has come under fire. Proposals for ending birthright citizenship emerge periodically from Congress. And presidential candidates Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham have questioned it in the past.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBirthright citizenship is rooted in the 14th Amendment, which grants citizenship to \u201call persons born or naturalized in the United States,\u201d including recently freed slaves. The amendment itself had precedent in the British legal concept of jus soli, \u201claw of the soil.\u201d It was then firmly established by the Supreme Court in the 1898 case of United States vs. Wong Kim Ark, which involved the San Francisco-born son of Chinese immigrants who successfully argued that he had been illegally denied citizenship rights. While some legal scholars have argued that birthright citizenship was never meant to apply to the children of those who illegally enter the United States, changing that interpretation today would be difficult, likely involving either a constitutional amendment or the Supreme Court overturning a century-old decision.\n\nOne thing that opponents of birthright citizenship get right is that the interpretation of the concept under U.S. law is unusual, particularly among major world economies. As the restrictionist think tank Center for Immigration Studies has pointed out, only about 30 countries grant birthright citizenship to any child born in the country, regardless of their parents\u2019 citizenship. Trump\u2019s policy paper suggests that birthright citizenship \"remains the biggest magnet for illegal immigration.\" But the experience of other countries that have placed restrictions on birthright in recent years\u2014Australia (2007), France (1993), and Britain (1983)\u2014suggests that these limits do not make the countries less attractive to migrants. More restrictive citizenship laws also wouldn\u2019t necessarily cut down on fraud and abuse. German law, which allows children born in the country to noncitizens to claim citizenship only if their parents have lived legally in the country for eight years, has created an underground market in false paternity, in which German-born imbissvaeter , or \u201cfast food fathers,\u201d claim to be a child\u2019s father for a fee. One need look no further than the unfolding catastrophe on the Haitian-Dominican border, which I reported on last month, for an example of the ugly consequences of removing a large population\u2019s right to citizenship.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:38:27.031+0000"}

Photo by Katarzyna Bialasiewicz/Thinkstock\n\nAja Riggs doesn\u2019t want the state of New Mexico to dictate how she\u2019ll die. Riggs suffers from uterine cancer\u2014currently in remission, but likely to return\u2014and fears it will leave her in excruciating pain during her final days. To avoid so much torment, Riggs wants to be sure her doctor can ease her into death through a painless overdose if she so chooses. But New Mexico law prohibits physician-assisted suicide. So Riggs, along with two oncologists, is suing to have the statute struck down as a violation of her fundamental rights under the state constitution.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nInitially, Riggs scored a major win in a state district court, which found that terminally ill patients have a fundamental liberty interest in securing assisted suicide. Earlier this month, however, an appeals court reversed that ruling. The setback is probably temporary. Bolstered by a blistering, incisive dissent, Riggs is taking her case to the progressive state Supreme Court. There, she hopes she can persuade the justices to force New Mexico to respect the legal rights of dying patients.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCourt challenges to assisted suicide bans are nothing new. In a 1997 case called Washington v. Glucksberg, a badly fractured U.S. Supreme Court rejected a broad challenge to Washington\u2019s prohibition. Five members of the court held that the right \u201cto assistance in committing suicide is not a fundamental liberty interested protected by the Due Process Clause.\u201d Only \u201cthose personal activities and decisions\u201d that are \u201cdeeply rooted in our history and traditions,\u201d the majority wrote, are protected by the Constitution\u2014and assisted suicide is not \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in the American tradition. At the same time, five justices also found that \u201csuffering patients\u201d may have \u201ca constitutionally cognizable interest in obtaining relief from the suffering that they may experience in the last days of their lives.\u201d\n\nThis apparently contradictory ruling was the handiwork of Justice Sandra Day O\u2019Connor. A consummate baby-splitter, O\u2019Connor tried to bridge the gap between the court\u2019s liberal and conservative blocs. Instead, she created a paradoxical ruling that has, ever since, stood on extremely shaky constitutional grounds. In fact, the court\u2019s recent ruling in the same-sex marriage case Obergefell v. Hodges seriously dented the validity of Glucksberg by replacing its crabbed logic with a more modern, expansive definition of \u201cliberty.\u201d (Chief Justice John Roberts accused the Obergefell majority of \u201ceffectively overruling\u201d Glucksberg\u2014as though that\u2019s a bad thing.)\n\nThe New Mexico Constitution has a due process clause that\u2019s virtually identical to the one in the United States Constitution, which holds in the Fifth and 14th amendments that no one shall be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d Like the federal version, New Mexico\u2019s protects substantive rights fundamental to individual dignity and autonomy. But the New Mexico Supreme Court has declared that its state constitution may be interpreted more expansively, to encompass a grander definition of individual dignity. Riggs argues that the New Mexico Constitution should protect her right to choose when to end her suffering.\n\nVanzi\u2019s brave, powerful dissent is likely to become a rallying cry for the death with dignity movement.\n\nIn a somewhat apologetic decision, the court of appeals refused to allow this more generous reading, holding that the state may force a terminally ill patient in extreme agony to remain alive until her life reaches \u201cits natural end.\u201d But in dissent, Judge Linda M. Vanzi laid waste to the majority\u2019s argument, writing that it \u201creflects a shocking disrespect for the individuals whose circumstances would bring them to seek aid in dying.\u201d Vanzi first notes, correctly, that Obergefell seriously erodes\u2014and maybe even overrules\u2014Glucksberg. (Same-sex marriage, after all, certainly isn\u2019t \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in American history.) She then explains that even if Glucksberg remained good law, she would \u201creject it as unpersuasive, flawed, and inadequate to protect the rights of New Mexicans.\u201d Instead, Vanzi writes that New Mexico\u2019s own traditional respect for individual autonomy should lead the court to hold that the state\u2019s citizens have a \u201cliberty right to aid in dying from a willing physician.\u201d\n\nAnd if New Mexico\u2019s due process clause implies this right, another provision all but demands it. In a passage unique to the New Mexico Constitution, \u201call persons\u201d in the state are promised \u201cnatural, inherent and inalienable rights.\u201d Among these are \u201cthe rights of enjoying and defending life and liberty \u2026 and of seeking and obtaining safety and happiness.\u201d This provision, Vanzi asserts, \u201caffords New Mexico citizens the right and agency to defend their lives and liberty by availing themselves of aid in dying\u201d when terminally ill. The state simply cannot justify \u201cintrud[ing] upon the doctor-patient relationship as it relates to the constitutional right to aid in dying.\u201d Vanzi concludes:\n\nThe question at the heart of this case is who has the right to decide when and how a mentally competent, terminally ill New Mexican will end her life after the options for meaningful improvement of her terminal condition have been exhausted, such that \u201clife\u201d means being forced to endure unbearable suffering until death arrives. \u2026 Other choices and decisions central to personal autonomy and dignity have long enjoyed the status of constitutionally protected liberty interests. I would hold that the New Mexico Constitution protects aid in dying as a liberty interest.\n\nVanzi\u2019s brave, powerful dissent is likely to become a rallying cry for the death with dignity movement. But it is also aimed squarely at the New Mexico Supreme Court itself, to which Riggs will appeal her case. There, she may have more luck: All five justices are Democrat-affiliated and have proven quite liberal on issues of personal dignity, including marriage equality. Should they side with Riggs, New Mexico will become the fifth state where terminally ill patients are afforded the liberty to end their lives. That might help create momentum in other states whose legislatures are considering assisted suicide measures.\n\nAs the death with dignity movement builds a critical mass, social and political pressure may force even conservative states to consider easing restrictions on physician-aided suicide. This model worked gangbusters with same-sex marriage, and death with dignity advocates are clearly hoping to employ it for their own cause.

As Koxvold photographed, he saw troops and contractors from all over the world who had arrived in helicopters that landed on the soccer field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a convivial microcosm of NATO; the Italians import fresh prosciutto, and installed their own pizza oven and a traditional espresso machine; the Germans drive armored G-wagens; everyone runs laps of the base in the cooler hours of the day,\u201d he said. \u201cMy favorite part of the compound was the gardens, which feel quite bucolic until you notice the tall, tan concrete walls and watchtowers behind them.\u201d\n\nJason Koxvold\n\nJason Koxvold\n\nFrom there, he traveled by Black Hawk to Bagram, the major hub of military air traffic in Afghanistan. At one point, it was the busiest military airbase in the world, but in the last two years its population has shrunk dramatically. When Koxvold was there, F-16 fighters were still taking off constantly, and C-130 and C-17 transport planes were always coming and going. But most of the time, the airfield felt \u201calmost eerie.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has the feeling somewhat of a ghost town; empty hallways and quiet cafeterias. Every week a rocket would come over the wall and be destroyed immediately by the automated C-RAM guns, to the point that people didn\u2019t seem perturbed by the \u2018incoming\u2019 alarms any more,\u201d he said via email.\n\nEvery night as Koxvold loaded his film, he would discuss his proposed shot list for the following day with the Air Force\u2019s Press Affairs unit. During the day, they\u2019d escort him to the locations he was permitted to access. Koxvold wanted to spend some time with Afghan National Army as well, but he found their media affairs unit \u201cquite unresponsive.\u201d\n\nJason Koxvold\n\nJason Koxvold\n\nWhile Koxvold admired the professionalism of the soldiers and airmen he met, he said he was left with the feeling that Resolute Support was a mission without a purpose. Further, he felt the Afghan population didn\u2019t want the troops there, an impression he got most strongly when driving around Kabul in an MRAP vehicle while the roof gunner swiveled his weapon toward civilians.\n\n\u201cThe eye contact I made through the windows was not warm. Which stands to reason: If Afghanistan sent thousands of troops to the United States to round up our domestic terrorists, we wouldn\u2019t stand it for one afternoon. You see that same spirit of resistance in the number of Afghans who will gladly launch a rocket over the walls at Bagram\u2014which is about a weekly occurrence.

Olivia burbles on about love, but Elle pays her no mind. \u201cLeave your keys on the coffee table,\u201d she tells the younger woman, cold as ice. Then she heads to the shower where she dissolves into tears.\n\nJune Thomas June Thomas is a Slate culture critic and editor of Outward, Slate\u2019s LGBTQ section.\n\nA little later, as Elle conjures happier memories by flipping through old photos and perfectly preserved children\u2019s artwork, she receives an unexpected visitor: It\u2019s her teenage granddaughter, Sage (Julia Garner), who\u2019s pregnant, has an appointment to get an abortion in just under nine hours, and needs $600 to pay for it. Since Elle, a poet and occasional academic writer-in-residence, has just $43 to her name and has made a charming, if unmelodic, wind chime from her chopped-up credit cards, there\u2019s only one possible course of action: The two of them whip the cover off Vi\u2019s amazing old Dodge and hit the road, hoping to find a friend who\u2019ll lend them the cash.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat what follows is transparently a string of guest-star vignettes doesn\u2019t make the road trip any less enjoyable to watch. What could have been an abbreviated version of 24, with Tomlin in the Jack Bauer role, turns into something far less frantic. There\u2019s no countdown clock on the screen as Elle and Sage ride around Los Angeles. Instead, it\u2019s a gentle journey of enlightenment, as Sage gets to see Elle at her worst\u2014when she childishly acts out in a pretentious coffee shop\u2014and at her best, when she stands up to dopey young guys and lovesick old men in order to safeguard Sage\u2019s future. Garner, memorable as the lonely high-schooler whose openness to seduction freaked out Matthew Rhys\u2019 Philip Jennings on The Americans, is curious and observant, keen to know more about her grandmother than crazy, angry, misanthropic\u2014the simplistic adjectives her mother uses to describe her.\n\nFrom the kid who knocked up Sage, who is objectively an impudent waste of DNA, Elle swipes a few bucks and some choice weed; from tattoo artist Deathy (Laverne Cox as a tatted-up Bettie Page type), she receives a small monetary contribution and some fresh ink.* A visit to a lesbian-run caf\u00e9\u2014where, true to life, the employees\u2019 interpersonal drama is far more interesting than the food\u2014provides a reminder that, although she claims to have a plan to raise the money, Elle has a poet\u2019s impracticality.\n\nThe way Grandma\u2019s female characters\u2014many of them queer\u2014dress, decorate their homes, and, most importantly, talk to each other is so beautifully observed, I was sure that Paul Weitz, who wrote and directed this movie, must be a sixtysomething lesbian rather than the guy who wrote Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and directed American Pie. That\u2019s unfair, though. Weitz has made fine movies about the challenges of intergenerational communication (In Good Company), estranged parents and children (Being Flynn and Admission), and the loneliness of single parenthood (About a Boy and, once again, Admission)\u2014and his experience on those projects shines throughout the film, but especially during a bravura scene between Tomlin and Sam Elliott, as Karl, a man from deep in her past.\n\nFor most of the movie, Elle acts like the aggrieved party, mumbling complaints about the friends and family members who disappeared when Vi got sick, but in her interactions with Karl, she\u2019s the one who must make amends. Elle and Karl, who haven\u2019t set eyes on each other for three decades, move swiftly from polite chatter to real talk. \u201cYou wronged me,\u201d Karl declares, with a force that shows the hurt is as raw as it was 49 years earlier when the injury occurred, and for once Elle doesn\u2019t try to deflect with anger or humor. As you get older, Karl says, \u201cold shit just bubbles up.\u201d In confronting her past with Karl, Elle finally seems able to let go of mistakes she\u2019s been feeling guilty about for almost 50 years.\n\nThe scene with Karl is so cathartic, and Tomlin and Elliott\u2019s chemistry is so intense, that subsequent events the movie has been building toward\u2014our eventual introduction to Sage\u2019s mother, Judy (Marcia Gay Harden, wonderful as an impatient, overcaffeinated superlawyer), and the appointment at the abortion clinic\u2014seem slightly anticlimactic. In part that\u2019s because the spotlight drifts away from Tomlin, who, this movie makes clear, has been criminally underused in the supporting roles she\u2019s typically cast in.\n\nGiven our culture\u2019s tendency to avoid the subject of abortion, Grandma\u2019s frank treatment of Sage\u2019s response to her unwanted pregnancy feels revolutionary. The decision to terminate is treated with utmost seriousness, and the responsibility is spread around\u2014Sage for making reckless decisions; Judy for paying more attention to work than to her daughter; and Elle\u2019s generation for failing to make abortion widely available at a reasonable price. But the film isn\u2019t about abortion, or even really about Sage. It\u2019s about grief and the importance of moving on. When Sage forces Elle to ask others for help, Elle has to let down her defenses and allow her loved ones to see that her misanthropy is mostly an act. She pushes people away so she can be alone with her memories of Vi. But she\u2019s also someone\u2019s grandma\u2014and at the end of the movie, she seems ready to recommit to that role.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:38:57.850+0000"}

They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists.\u201d\u2014that shot him to the top of the GOP polls. He\u2019s been there ever since, despite racism, sexism, and open disrespect for combat veterans. Now, Trump is the center of gravity in the Republican race for president, and his antics affect every candidate, from mainstream picks like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio, to more direct rivals like Scott Walker and Ted Cruz.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nOn Monday, his pull got a little stronger. Trump published his first set of proposals, a plan for immigration reform titled in the style of the candidate\u2019s signature slogan: \u201cImmigration Reform That Will Make America Great Again.\u201d Neither detailed nor precise, it still stands as the most comprehensive immigration plan yet released in the Republican presidential race. And together with Trump as its spokesman, the plan is poised to move the GOP conversation on immigration from simple restrictionism to something more punitive and cruel.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDespite his rhetoric, Trump wouldn\u2019t deport unauthorized immigrants en masse. Instead, in line with Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cself-deportation\u201d strategy from 2012, he would push \u201cattrition through enforcement\u201d to make life intolerable for unauthorized immigrants and their families.\n\nTo start, he would triple the number of immigration enforcement officers, and empower them with greater authority to track down and deport unauthorized immigrants across the country. His White House would ask Congress to defund \u201csanctuary cities\u201d and create a nationwide \u201ce-verify\u201d system for employers. He would increase penalties for immigrants who overstay a visa, including criminal prosecution, and he would end \u201cbirthright citizenship,\u201d a provision of the 14th Amendment that gives automatic citizenship to anyone born in the United States and its territories. Originally written to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Dred Scott, it now stands as a testament to American openness. And while Trump doesn\u2019t say that he would strip citizenship from the 4.5 million Americans born to unauthorized parents, many of them children, the implication is that he would. If so, it would be, as Ezra Klein notes for Vox, an astonishing act of collective punishment.\n\nAnd it continues. To pay for all of this\u2014including a wall across the southern border of the United States\u2014Trump would seize all remittance payments to Mexico (from both legal and unauthorized immigrants), increase fees on all temporary visas, border crossing cards, and NAFTA worker\u2019s visas, and raise tariffs on goods from Mexico. In addition, Trump would limit visas to high-skilled workers, and limit the number of refugees and asylum seekers who come to American shores. The overriding goal, again, is to keep new immigrants out of the country\u2014regardless of status\u2014and punish the ones that are already here.\n\nTrump might be a joke, but his plan is not. If implemented, it would bring tremendous suffering to millions of Americans\u2014native-born, naturalized, or otherwise. But because it speaks to the Republican base\u2014in a new CNN poll, 44 percent of self-described Republicans and Republican-leaning independents agree with Trump on \u201cillegal immigration\u201d\u2014it\u2019s getting a fair hearing from serious conservatives.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said his immigration plan was \u201csimilar\u201d to Trump\u2019s; that he would support building a wall along the Mexican border; and that he would consider \u201cchanging the rules\u201d on birthright citizenship. Other candidates, like Bobby Jindal and Chris Christie, have echoed Trump\u2019s views on birthright citizenship.* Likewise, the editors of National Review called it a \u201cgood start\u201d that\u2019s \u201csensible in its basic outline and better in many respects than the ideas presented by his rivals.\u201d\n\nNearly three years ago, after the 2012 election, Republican leaders urged a new approach for the party on immigration. They urged inclusive rhetoric and policies to match. They didn\u2019t get far, and a grassroots backlash killed the GOP plan for reform. Now, with Trump, they\u2019ve come full circle.

{"entityId": 187, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nIn what can only be described as a ill-fated attempt to focus this summer's primary campaign season on something other than Donald Trump's noxious opinions about Hispanics and women, both Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker have unveiled their plans for repealing and replacing Obamacare. Rubio laid out his thoughts in a Politico op-ed Monday night. Walker released a brief policy paper Tuesday, which he elaborated on during a speech delivered, as a few sharp observers noted on Twitter, before the symbolically inconvenient backdrop of a screw machine factory. The two proposals have much in common, and together should give the public a pretty good notion of what to expect from the GOP field on health care.\n\nJordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.\n\nWhat's the major idea? After scrapping the Affordable Care Act, both Rubio and Walker would essentially give Americans a little bit of money so that they can possibly afford to buy cheap insurance. And by cheap insurance, I mean really crappy insurance. This is the approach that has been popular among conservative policy thinkers for a while, and is basically the inverse of Obamacare, which gives Americans subsidies to buy higher quality coverage. The GOP strategy consists largely of three main steps:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAllow Americans to buy coverage across state lines. Give people who don't get insurance through their employer a tax credit so that they can purchase a private plan. Create special \"high-risk pools\" for the sick who can't get coverage otherwise.\n\n\n\nNow here's how that all works together.\n\nToday, even though Obamacare put in place a new set of federal standards, health insurers are still basically regulated by the states, which have different laws about consumer protection and what conditions companies are required to cover. The result is that Americans have to buy health plans in the state where they live. Republicans, like Rubio and Walker, would like to change that system by allowing consumers to shop around the country, which they argue would create competition and drive down prices.\n\nIn theory, there's nothing wrong with this idea. But it only works if the federal government sets acceptable guidelines about what sorts of plans insurers are allowed to sell. Otherwise, it would almost certainly spur a harmful race to the bottom, in which companies would flock to states with the loosest regulations, and offer cut-rate insurance offering little protection. The likely result, as the Congressional Budget Office argued years ago, is that young, healthy customers would opt for the least expensive options available, while older, sicker Americans would end up paying more for coverage. Meanwhile, many of those invincible-feeling twentysomethings would find their health insurance wasn't worth much once they actually needed it. And the chances are that a Walker or Rubio administration wouldn't do much to stop that from happening.\n\nSetting those niggling little problems aside, letting Americans buy health insurance in a lightly regulated national market would probably lead companies to offer some affordable catastrophic coverage. That's where we get to Step 2. Both Rubio and Walker would offer Americans without job-based insurance a tax credit to buy on the individual market, which would likely be enough to pay for a low-end plan.\n\nWalker notes that there are some people who, under his system, might actually get a bigger tax credit than they would now under Obamacare, which subsidizes coverage purchased on its health care exchanges. But if the governor really wants to offer even remotely generous tax credits, it's probably going to be expensive. And that's a bit of a problem, since he's planning to 86 all of the taxes that currently pay for the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nOf course, tax credits won't do much good for people if they can't get coverage because they have cancer or a disability. Obamacare, of course, outright bans insurers from discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, then makes it up to the companies by requiring every American to get insured, which gives them more healthy (and profitable) customers. Rubio, Walker, and other Republicans would eliminate those rules. Instead, they would likely try to help the sick get coverage through other means, likely by subsidizing state-run \"high-risk pools.\" (Both Rubio and Walker suggest this is only one option, but it's really the conservative policy of choice.) The idea is that companies can sell special insurance plans designed for the infirm, which the government can help pay for.\n\nThis is an idea that has been tried many times before, most recently as a stopgap measure under Obamacare that was meant to tide people over until the law went into full effect. The lessons have been pretty clear: Most of the time, the plans offered in high-risk pools remain extremely expensive and tend not to enroll many individuals. You could potentially fix those problems by injecting many billions of dollars into them. But last I checked, Republicans aren't typically fans of government spending, and the chances that they would appropriately fund the pools seem rather small.\n\n\n\nBoth Rubio and Walker offer up additional ideas, some of which would be, well, controversial. For instance, Rubio would seemingly fund his plan partly by cutting back on the tax break for employer-provided health insurance, which, as Vox's Sarah Kliff writes, would have the obvious effect of making most Americans' insurance more expensive (it's also probably a nonstarter in Congress). Both he and Walker, would also give more control over Medicaid to the states, which is typically code for cutting back on benefits to the poor. Rubio also explicitly says he would eventually turn Medicare into a program that helps seniors buy private insurance. Walker, perhaps wisely, doesn't really touch the subject.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:39:18.015+0000"}

A vote for a motion disapproving of the agreement, which Obama has said he will veto, is likely in September. The next big question mark is Menendez\u2019s New Jersey counterpart Cory Booker, who is still undecided and is being heavily lobbied by both the White House and the pro-Israel groups that donated more to his campaign than any other Democrat in the last election cycle.\n\nEven with heavy lobbying on both sides, Obama\u2019s veto of the agreement is still likely to stand. About 30 of the 34 senators needed to uphold a presidential veto are already on board, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi says she is optimistic she can keep most of her caucus together despite some notable defections. The fact that the veto is likely to stand may actually make it easier for Iran hawks like Menendez and Schumer to oppose the White House.\n\nNevertheless, there\u2019s already some speculation about how the White House could proceed if Obama\u2019s veto were overridden. The AP\u2019s Deb Riechmann noted Monday that though he would undoubtedly face heavy criticism, Obama could still lift most of the sanctions imposed on Iran through executive order, and Europe and the U.N. could lift others. Still, some of the toughest sanctions, including measures orchestrated in large part by Menendez, were imposed by Congress, and Iran could interpret a decision not to lift these as the U.S. violating its commitments under the agreement, something hardliners, including the country\u2019s supreme leader, have warned of. This would probably make Iran less likely to comply with the terms of the deal. The warning from Washington\u2019s hawks that Iran can\u2019t be trusted to halt its nuclear program could turn out to be self-fulfilling.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:39:24.401+0000"}
{"entityId": 191, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images\n\nIt felt a bit like a return of the Vladimir Putin of yore today as video was released of the Russian president climbing into a small submersible to view the recently discovered wreck of a Byzantine era trading ship off the coast of Crimea. Putin spoke by radio to Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev while still underwater, saying the wreck showed \"how deep our historical roots are.\" As Buzzfeed's Max Seddon notes, the timing is unfortunate as this month marks the 15th anniversary of the sinking of the submarine Kursk, one of the worst naval disasters in Russian history and a lowpoint of Putin's presidency, but official media accounts are unlikely to dwell on that.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nThis type of adventurous outdoorsy stunt\u2014often involving wild animals, sometimes not involving a shirt\u2014used to be fairly common (this isn't even his first submarine ride), but then they started to work against Putin: Rumors that he had been injured on a glider flight with endangered cranes drew unwanted attention to his advancing age; he was publicly ridiculed after emerging wet-suitted from the Black Sea having \u201cdiscovered\u201d several rare amphorae. So Putin\u2019s handlers transitioned him to a more serious, sober image. But given recent events, perhaps it was decided that some levity was in order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRussia is struggling through a deep recession, the first since 2009, and the ruble just hit a six-month low against the dollar with analysts saying deep structural changes are needed to right the country\u2019s economy. The main culprit is the falling price of oil\u2014the source of about half of the Russian government\u2019s revenue\u2014currently trading at around $42 a barrel compared to $115 last summer. Western sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine have also limited Russian access to foreign capital and much-needed equipment for the oil industry.\n\nMeanwhile, the retaliatory sanctions Russia placed on imports of western food products have hurt Russian consumers more than foreign producers, with prices for consumer goods increasing while the economy craters.\n\nAs the New York Times notes today, none of this has put much of a dent in Putin\u2019s approval ratings, which remain high thanks to his popular interventions in the face of western opposition in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. But the future outlook\u2019s not so bright there either.\n\nIn addition to underwater sightseeing, Putin\u2019s three-day trip to Crimea is an opportunity to tout the integration and development of the region that Russia annexed from Ukraine last year. But elsewhere in Ukraine, the violent stalemate continues with nine killed this week in some of the worst fighting between Russian-backed separatist and Ukrainian troops since a fragile ceasefire went into effect in February.\n\nAs analyst Brian Whitmore recently argued in the Atlantic, if Eastern Ukraine remains a \u201cfrozen conflict\u201d with sporadic low-level violence and no political resolution, it\u2019s not great for Moscow, which finds itself occupying a region that was economically depressed even before it was devastated by war. In contrast, Ukraine will be freer to pursue integration with Europe, with ethnic Russian voters in the east effectively cut out of the political process. If Putin\u2019s original goal was to punish Ukrainian leaders for rejecting Russian influence, he may in the long run end up accomplishing the opposite.\n\nNo matter how many submarine expeditions Putin takes, the dismal state of the economy will eventually take its toll on the government, particularly if the president\u2019s foreign policy goals are stalled.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:39:26.917+0000"}

You know how your father gets.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what my mum told me last year when I arrived in Australia for Christmas with my boyfriend for the first time. My mum\u2019s statement felt like a slap in the face: After spending so many years struggling with myself, I was finally happy and totally in love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMy mum, who is Australian, was alluding to the more conservative background of my dad, who is Mexican. Like him, I was born and raised in Mexico, and like him, I experienced the conservative Catholic values and machismo that are the national norm there. It was for this reason that I\u2018d also had concerns when coming out to him. But the truth is, he couldn\u2019t have been more accepting, of both me and Joseph. When we left, my dad said, \u201cWell done. He\u2019s a great man.\u201d\n\nIn recent months, I\u2019ve found myself reflecting on these events more and more. And last week, the contradiction came to a head: A few months after legalizing same-sex marriage, Mexico\u2019s Supreme Court legalized gay adoption. Just one day earlier, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott had banned members of his party from voting in favor of a new marriage equality bill, effectively killing it.\n\nLike many in Australia and around the world, I was shocked, hurt, and appalled. How could this happen? In one of the world\u2019s most advanced democracies; in the country that hosts Mardi Gras and gave us Kylie Minogue and Priscilla, Queen of the Desert; in a country that prides itself on giving everyone a \u201cfair go\u201d and coined the term no worries. How could this happen?\n\nIt would be easy to blame the failure of marriage equality on Australia\u2019s conservative government and to further demonize Abbott as head homophobe. But the truth is, marriage equality has been up for debate in Australia for a decade. It\u2019s been there through two terms of a left-wing Labor government, and it still didn't make it through Parliament and into law. And while most Aussies now support gay marriage, we still elected a government that is totally opposed to equal rights.\n\nThe question remains: Why have Mexico\u2019s socio-cultural norms helped to advance legal recognition of same-sex relationships there, while Australia\u2019s values have impeded progress on equality?\n\nLet\u2019s start with the church. Religion is a big deal in Mexico: 82 percent of the population identify as Catholic, compared with just 25 percent in Australia. If you\u2019ve ever read Catholic doctrine or heard anything coming out of the Vatican, you\u2019d think this would make for a very homophobic society. But when you consider that Catholic bastions like Ireland, Spain, France, Argentina, Uruguay, and Mexico have all legalized same-sex marriage, it\u2019s clear that\u2019s not quite right.\n\nCatholic social values have changed dramatically. A recent Pew Research survey found that 60 percent of U.S. Catholics supported same-sex marriage, while a 2013 survey of Mexican Catholics also revealed majority support. Meanwhile, the referendum results in Ireland, where 84 percent identify as Catholic, speak for themselves.\n\nThe reasons for this shift in Catholic attitudes to homosexuality are vast and merit a more detailed discussion (for a great overview, check out Peter Weber\u2019s discussion in the Week). For me, though, the most important factor is the Catholic emphasis on family. As Mo Moulton writes in the Atlantic, Catholic doctrine, with its \u201cemphasis on family ties and community cohesion,\u201d was a key element in Ireland\u2019s same-sex marriage win.\n\nWhenever I go back to Mexico, the dozens of cousins and second cousins and third cousins I have there\u2014many of whom I haven\u2019t seen in years\u2014are quick to embrace me as primo, inviting me into their homes and telling me all the family gossip. By contrast, in Australia, I didn\u2019t even know I had family outside of my first cousins until my grandmother passed away a few years ago and other relatives sent their condolences.\n\nIn a country where family is the basis for society, it\u2019s harder to exclude members of the population from legal recognition. It\u2019s harder to kick out your gay son or hate your lesbian sister. When the sacrament of marriage is the cornerstone of the family, it\u2019s only natural that this should be a right for everyone\u2014as in Mexico. To see the contrast in Australia, one need only look at Tony Abbott\u2019s constant refusal to recognize the legal rights of his own lesbian sister.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t homophobic Mexican families, or that Aussie families love their kids any less because they\u2019re not Catholic, but it is undeniable that family values have played a role in moving gay rights forward in Latin America. For us Latinos, blood is always thicker than water.\n\nAnother key factor is la revoluci\u00f3n. Unlike Australia\u2019s calm progression to nationhood, Mexico\u2019s history has been marked by constant upheaval. From the bloody War of Independence in 1810 to the revolution a century later all the way to the current drug war, Mexico\u2019s development has been a fraught one. While this has certainly resulted in a more dysfunctional and often unstable political climate, one positive by-product is a greater willingness to challenge the status quo, what Octavio Paz describes as the Mexican desire to chingar. Australia has never experienced the kind of upheavals that lead to profound self-reflection and dramatic cultural change.\n\nRevolution and the end of dictatorial rule has given rise to powerful social changes across Latin America, often framed in a human rights context. It\u2019s what Elisabeth Jay Friedman, director of Latin American studies at the University of San Francisco, calls \u201csavvy social mobilization.\u201d As I wrote in a piece for Newsweek last year, activists have been able to harness the new social movements that emerge after dictators are toppled, using tactics that have advanced human rights generally to advance LGBTQ rights specifically. This was particularly important in countries like Argentina and Brazil.\n\nIn Mexico, the spirit of revolution is embodied in its great capital, el Distrito Federal, which has been the epicenter of both conflict and change. The sprawling metropolis, home to 22 million, houses more galleries and museums than any other city in the world. It is here where the greatest Mexican writers, thinkers, and artists, from Carlos Fuentes to Diego Rivera, created their masterworks. Its magnetism stretches far beyond Mexico\u2019s borders, attracting everyone from Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez to Leon Trotsky.\n\nIt\u2019s little wonder, then, that Mexico City was the first place in Latin America to legalize same-sex marriage, a decision that has had a dramatic impact in advancing gay rights around the country and across the region.\n\nContrast this with Canberra, Australia\u2019s small, provincial capital, and it\u2019s a little less surprising that its politicians are unwilling to embrace innovation. A city of countless roundabouts, everything in Canberra, including its politics, seems to go around in circles.\n\nI\u2019m being a bit unfair: Six dull years in Canberra gave me a poor view of the capital, where same-sex marriage was briefly recognized back in 2013. But still, Australia has been remarkably slow to evolve on social issues. Just 60 years ago, Aboriginal children were still being forcibly taken from their families; indeed, indigenous Australians weren\u2019t given full legal recognition until the 1960s. Up until the 1970s, the country upheld the \u201cWhite Australia Policy,\u201d which, in historian Charles Bean\u2019s words, was created explicitly for the \u201cexclusion of Oriental peoples.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ve come a long way since then, and Australia is beautiful place to live (especially if you\u2019re a straight, white male). Nevertheless, it\u2019s worth remembering that there is a strict, conservative streak stretching back for more than a hundred years; a long snake that has reared its ugly head in the form of Tony Abbott.\n\nAbbott has explicitly refused to acknowledge any influence from international developments on gay rights, saying recently that \u201cwhat happens in the United States is obviously a matter for the United States, just as what happened in Ireland [in its marriage referendum] was a matter for the Irish.\u201d\n\nAustralia\u2019s political leaders have once again revealed Australia to be an isolated island nation. It gave the world Kylie and Priscilla, but it also gave us the xenophobic One Nation party and Abbott\u2019s appalling refugee policy. This kind of xenophobia also leads to a refusal to engage with the international dialogue of progress.\n\nBy contrast, Mexico often acts as a bridge between its powerful northern neighbor and its developing cultural cousins to the south. Unlike Australia, Mexico (like most of Latin America) has explicitly allowed itself to be influenced by landmark decisions in other countries. As Omar Encarnaci\u00f3n wrote in the New York Times last year, \u201cLatin American high courts have in recent years indulged in \u2018trans-national legalism\u2019 to advance gay rights, by borrowing legal precedents from other countries, including the United States.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:39:44.866+0000"}
{"entityId": 196, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "FDD\u2019s chief funders have been drawn almost entirely from American Jews who have a long history of funding pro-Israel organizations. They include Bernard Marcus, the co-founder of Home Depot, whiskey heirs Samuel and Edgar Bronfman, gambling mogul Sheldon Adelson, heiress Lynn Schusterman, Wall Street speculators Michael Steinhardt and Paul Singer, and Leonard Abramson, founder of U.S. Healthcare. As Eli Clifton has documented , from 2008 to 2011, the largest contributors were Abramson, Marcus, Adelson, and Singer, and businessman Newton Becker. Some of FDD\u2019s donors, particularly in the organization\u2019s early years, gave to a wide range of groups that back Israel, but some of them, including Marcus, Adelson, Becker, and their foundations, have also contributed to groups like the Zionist Organization of America and Christians United for Israel that are aligned with Israeli right-wing nationalists who favor a \u201cgreater Israel\u201d that includes East Jerusalem and the West Bank settlements. (When I asked May whether he agreed with Adelson\u2019s stands on Iran and Palestinian statehood, he said that Adelson hadn\u2019t contributed to FDD for \u201csome time\u201d and that he was not \u201cup-to-date\u201d on Adelson\u2019s views. Nevertheless, in a July 2012 article in National Review objecting to a New York Times editorial critical of Adelson, May defended the gambling mogul\u2019s rejection of a Palestinian state.)\n\nTo be sure, FDD is no longer a public relations group for Israel. And over the years, it has become much more of a conventional think tank than an advocacy group. But in several important ways, the Foundation for Defense of Democracies seems to have remained an organization dedicated intellectually and politically to the defense of one particular democracy.\n\nFDD\u2019s website says simply that it was founded \u201cto promote pluralism, defend democratic values, and fight the ideologies that drive terrorism,\u201d but, as the journalist Ali Gharib has noted , it arose out of an organization committed to burnishing Israel\u2019s reputation in the United States. On April 24, 2001, three major pro-Israel donors incorporated an organization called EMET (Hebrew for \u201ctruth\u201d). In an application to the Internal Revenue Service for tax-exempt status, May explained that the group \u201cwas to provide education to enhance Israel\u2019s image in North America and the public\u2019s understanding of issues affecting Israeli-Arab relations.\u201d But in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, May broadened the group\u2019s mission and changed its name to the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. As he explained in a supplement to the IRS, the group\u2019s board of directors decided to focus on \u201cdevelop[ing] educational materials on the eradication of terrorism everywhere in the world.\u201d\n\nFDD was the brainchild of a New York Times journalist-turned-Republican operative. Clifford May, who is now 63 worked as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times and an editor of the Rocky Mountain News, but in 1997 became the communications director of the Republican National Committee. In September 2001, having left the RNC, May was recruited to lead a new foreign policy group.* With thick brown hair, a trim, graying beard, and rimless glasses, May looks like an early-20 th -century European intellectual, but he has proved to be a master political entrepreneur in an era of television and social media.\n\nFDD also describes itself as a global research organization. Its purpose, it says, is to conduct \u201cresearch and provide education on international terrorism\u2014the most serious security threat to the United States and other free, democratic nations.\u201d But it has conducted its research from a particular vantage point and with a relatively narrow focus. Its research and advocacy have centered on the Middle East and in particular on conflicts and issues that impinge on Israel. And its positions have closely tracked those of the Likud party and its leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2014not just on the Iran deal, but on the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians and the desirability of a two-state solution. Understanding the think tank\u2019s ideological affinity with the Israeli government, and the roots of that affinity, helps explain the special role that FDD has played in opposing the Iran deal and may shed light on what FDD hopes to accomplish by derailing President Obama\u2019s signature foreign policy accomplishment.\n\nFDD bills itself as \u201ca non-partisan policy institute\u201d in the tradition of groups like the Council on Foreign Relations. Legally speaking, that\u2019s true. But while FDD once had a few Democrats on its Board of Advisors, and can still find a few Democrats like Menendez who are receptive to its message, it has become a Republican-backed organization that reflects the growing political polarization in Washington.\n\nIn the wake of the agreement\u2019s announcement, FDD experts have appeared on Fox News, CBS, CNN, PBS, and other television outlets at least 35 times to oppose it. FDD\u2019s executive director, Mark Dubowitz, is credited with helping design the sanctions regime that was put in place in 2010 and with helping Sens. Mark Kirk and Robert Menendez craft a bill that they introduced in December 2013 that would have set conditions on a final agreement that Iran would have been sure to reject.\n\nDuring the last 18 months, FDD\u2019s experts have testified 17 times before Congress in opposition to the interim and now final agreement. By contrast, experts from the Heritage Foundation, whose budget\u2014$113 million in 2013\u2014is more than 15 times the size of FDD\u2019s, and which also opposes the agreement, have not appeared at all. Critics of the agreement from the American Enterprise Institute, whose budget is more than eight times as large, have testified only once. Of the four witnesses that the Senate Banking Committee called to testify on Aug. 5 on a panel on sanctions against Iran, two were FDD experts, and a third was on the FDD Board of Advisors.\n\nBut that\u2019s not enough. Opponents of the deal, if they are to carry the day, need crisp talking points and plausible arguments; they need credible experts who will back up their position in congressional hearings, on opinion pages, and on TV and radio. And no organization has been better at providing this kind of intellectual firepower than the little-known Foundation for Defense of Democracies , a relatively small Washington think tank that is devoting itself to defeating the Iran deal.\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the so-called 800-pound gorilla , is the big player in lobbying against the nuclear weapons agreement that the United States and five other countries signed with Iran. When it comes to influencing members of Congress, AIPAC has the access to financial contributors with which to reward the compliant and pressure the recalcitrant.\n\nMay always avoided calling for war against Iran except as a last resort, but in 2008, he welcomed former CIA case officer Reuel Marc Gerecht and Iran expert Michael Ledeen (who was a bit player in the Israeli part of the Iran-Contra scandal) to FDD from the American Enterprise Institute.* Gerecht had already been calling for a pre-emptive military strike against Iran. At a Bloomberg conference in 2010, Gerecht would joke that he had \u201ccounted up the other day: I\u2019ve written about 25,000 words about bombing Iran. Even my mom thinks I\u2019ve gone too far.\u201d\n\nAfter Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s announcement in February 2006 that Iran was resuming enriching uranium, FDD and May began focusing on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. May accepted the Israeli government\u2019s argument that an Iranian nuclear weapon posed an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Israel. He described Iran\u2019s goal as \u201ca Middle East without Jews,\u201d and insisted that Iran posed a direct threat to the United States. \u201cAhmadinejad\u2019s genocidal threats against Israel have been well-publicized,\u201d he wrote , \u201cbut from time to time, he also likes to remind his followers that \u2018a world without America \u2026 is attainable.\u2019\u201d (May\u2019s elision, not mine.)\n\nMay and FDD have been calling for action against Iran since the organization\u2019s founding. And in doing so, they have almost invariably cited Israel\u2019s security. In April 2002 in USA Today, May argued that Israel\u2019s enemies are the same ones as the \u201csuicidal/homicidal terrorists\u201d who view Americans as \u201chated infidels,\u201d and he linked them in turn to \u201cIran and Iraq,\u201d which he described as \u201cterrorist-sponsoring regimes attempting to develop weapons of mass destruction.\u201d The next spring, in the wake of the invasion of Iraq, May suggested that Iranian dissidents could play a similar role to that of the Iraqi dissidents whom the United States was attempting to install in power.\n\nThose FDD donors who were dependable Democrats seem also to have dropped out. Indeed there is now a clear match between the FDD\u2019s contributors and former and existing board members of the increasingly powerful Republican Jewish Coalition, to which May himself was an adviser in the early 2000s. They include Adelson, Marcus, Abramson, Singer, David Epstein, Larry A. Mizel, and Sam Fox. The two organizations have worked in tandem to attempt to defeat the Obama administration\u2019s agreement with Iran.\n\nFDD lost its Democratic board members in 2008. That February it spun off an advocacy organization, the Defense of Democracies, which, according to National Journal, was seeded by a $2 million grant from Adelson. The new group began running ads against Democrats who opposed an intelligence surveillance bill favored by the Bush administration. In response, Brazile, Schumer, Engel, and Marshall quit.\n\nIn its first years, FDD had ties to Democrats. Former Al Gore for President campaign manager Donna Brazile, New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, and Reps. Eliot Engel and Jim Marshall were on FDD\u2019s board; and a few initial funders like the Israeli American Haim Saban were associated with the Democratic Party. But over the years, FDD has become an almost entirely Republican-backed organization.\n\nMay doesn\u2019t go out of his way to highlight FDD\u2019s origin as a promoter of Israel and its connections to Washington\u2019s pro-Israel lobby. When I asked him about the group\u2019s emergence from a \u201cpro-Israel organization,\u201d he made no mention of its initial incarnation as EMET. He wrote back, \u201cI was recruited to found FDD after 9/11/01 by Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick whom I knew from my New York Times reporting days. FDD was conceived as a policy institute focusing on national security\u2014of the US and other democratic societies.\u201d The group also omits Dershowitz\u2019s experience at AIPAC from her online bio, writing that she worked for \u201ca leading foreign policy organization for 14 years.\u201d But when I asked May whether the organization\u2019s defense of democracies really boiled down to a defense of the United States and Israel, he did write back, \u201cIsrael, it seemed to me then and seems to me now, is the world\u2019s most endangered democratic society. Those whose mission is \u2018Death to America\u2019 also vow \u2018Death to Israel.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMay himself has adhered more closely to Netanyahu\u2019s position of giving lip service to a two-state solution while maintaining that because of Palestinian refusal to recognize the state of Israel, the conditions do not exist for realizing it. In August 2009, May criticized the Obama administration for pressing Netanyahu to begin talks with the Palestinians and recommended instead Netanyahu\u2019s option of economic development for the West Bank. In his writing, May consistently puts quotes around the adjective occupied for the Palestinian territories that Israel has under military rule. When I asked May why, he replied, \u201cThe West Bank, seized from Jordan after Jordan attacked Israel in 1967, should more accurately be called disputed territories.\u201d\n\nIn their writings, FDD experts have endorsed a view of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that is in accord with, or sometimes even to the right of, the views of Netanyahu and the Likud party. In November 2007, FDD Senior Fellow Andrew McCarthy wrote in National Review that the Bush administration, in trying to forge a two-state solution, was \u201chellbent on granting statehood to savages who worship \u2018martyrdom.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSince its founding, FDD has been running tours of Israel for American academics (with most of their expenses paid) similar to those run for journalists and politicians by AIPAC and other groups. University of Kentucky political scientist Robert Farley, who went on an FDD tour in 2008, says \u201cthe goal of the trip was to inculcate a particular view of the Israeli security situation and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\u201d FDD\u2019s view, Farley says, was \u201cright-wing Likudnik on the relations between Israel and its neighbors and with the Palestinians.\u201d The tour leaders took a \u201cnegative\u201d view of Palestinian statehood. \u201cIt was understood that the military occupation of the West Bank was necessary to prevent a terrorist campaign against Israel.\u201d\n\nMuch of FDD\u2019s key staff was drawn from people who have focused their work on defending Israel from its critics. May\u2019s second in command in FDD\u2019s early years was the Israeli Nir Boms, who had worked for the Israeli Embassy in Washington. Toby Dershowitz, who spent 14 years as AIPAC\u2019s communications head, has handled communications for FDD. Dershowitz\u2019s public relations organization, the Dershowitz Group, is housed in the same downtown M Street location as FDD, and Dershowitz is now listed as the group\u2019s vice president for government relations and strategy. Jonathan Schanzer, FDD\u2019s vice president for research, worked earlier at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, which was spun off from AIPAC decades ago as a research organization not subject to the tax restrictions on groups that lobby.\n\nAfter Obama took office, FDD, led by Dubowitz, proposed imposing further sanctions on Iran to force it to abandon its nuclear program. But Dubowitz himself was skeptical about whether sanctions would actually lead to a diplomatic solution. In April 2011, after new sanctions had been imposed, he told Israel\u2019s Ynetnews that \u201cthe sanctions are working by putting pressure on the regime, although they have not secured their objective and may never do so\u2014putting an end to Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The best way is to work towards changing the regime. Any deal cut with this regime will be violated.\u201d When Hassan Rouhani, widely considered a moderate on Iran\u2019s political spectrum, was elected Iran\u2019s president in June of 2013, Dubowitz wrote that \u201cthe election of Rouhani, a loyalist of Iran\u2019s supreme leader and a master of nuclear deceit, doesn\u2019t get us any closer to stopping Iran\u2019s nuclear drive.\u201d In August 2013 he warned that Rouhani\u2019s \u201cstatements reveal a conspiratorial, anti-American, and anti-Israeli worldview.\u201d\n\nDubowitz rejected the interim agreement that the United States and five other countries reached with Iran in November 2013, under which Iran temporarily restricted its nuclear program in exchange for the removal of some sanctions. He worked with Kirk and Menendez to devise new legislation that would have required Iran to dismantle all nuclear energy facilities and to stop any aid to Hezbollah and other allies in the region. The legislation also promised that the United States would \u201cstand with Israel\u201d if it went to war with Iran.\n\nClifford May doesn\u2019t go out of his way to highlight FDD\u2019s origin as a promoter of Israel and its connections to D.C.\u2019s pro-Israel lobby.\n\nIn the days before the final agreement with Iran was signed on July 14, FDD took to the hustings, but it didn\u2019t speak with a single voice. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Gerecht and Dubowitz declared their skepticism about the agreement, but the piece reflected Gerecht\u2019s more extreme, and highly original, views on American foreign policy and Iran. Gerecht and Dubowitz argued the dominant Republican strategy of upping sanctions and threatening military force would be \u201cunlikely to thwart the mullahs\u2019 nuclear designs.\u201d The only way to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons was through a military strike, but a military strike could be justified only if Iran were to violate the agreement it had made. \u201cNo American president would destroy Iranian nuclear sites without first exhausting diplomacy,\u201d they wrote. Therefore, the best chance to stop Iran would be to let the agreement go through and wait for Iran to violate it, which, according to Gerecht and Dubowitz, it inevitably would. The \u201chawks who believe that airstrikes are the only possible option for stopping an Iranian nuke should welcome a deal perhaps more than anyone,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis is because the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is tailor-made to set Washington on a collision course with Tehran.\u201d In other words, the point of supporting a diplomatic solution was so that it would pave the way for a military strike.\n\nBut in his congressional testimony, Dubowitz took a more conventional tack. He denounced the agreement for providing \u201cIran with a patient path to a nuclear weapon\u201d and called for amending it with new, tougher conditions. May, too, opposed the agreement and said Obama should demand more concessions from Iran.\n\nGerecht and Dubowitz\u2019s Wall Street Journal op-ed had the virtue of being logical, even if its logic led to war. But the call by May and Dubowitz to reopen negotiations and demand a much tougher agreement made less sense. Dubowitz\u2019s proposed amendments to the deal\u2014which went beyond Iran\u2019s nuclear policy and into its human rights policy and foreign policy\u2014were sure to be rejected by Iran, and probably by other signatories to the deal. And, anyway, Obama, in the last year of his presidency, would be in no position to renegotiate the agreement, even in the highly unlikely event that all five of his negotiating partners, including Russia and China, would be willing to join him in doing so.\n\nThese kinds of considerations have led some supporters of the agreement to argue that hawks like May and Dubowitz, in advocating renegotiation, know that this path will bear no fruit and secretly want to hasten war with Iran. But according to Gerecht, what his colleagues really hope for is that one of the Republicans adamantly opposed to the deal will be elected president in November 2016 and will propose even tougher sanctions and successfully pressure Europe, if not China and Russia, to go along. That scenario seems equally far-fetched, resting on an assumption of America\u2019s powers of persuasion in Europe\u2014which were not evident in the crisis in Syria in 2013\u2014and what is at best a 50\u201350 political calculation about who will be the next president.\n\nWhat may explain why May and Dubowitz seem content with killing the agreement\u2014even if that means damaging U.S. relations with other signatories, getting no agreement whatsoever that Iran will forgo a nuclear weapon, and risking greater war in the region\u2014is a concern that began to surface in May\u2019s columns earlier this year. May described sympathetically Israel\u2019s \u201cworry that Mr. Obama means to form a de facto alliance with Iran.\u201d Some observers have long said that this concern actually lies at the heart of the Israeli government\u2019s opposition to a deal with Iran: Netanyahu fears that a deal would wed American foreign policy to an irredeemably revolutionary Iran at the expense of Israel. And one person familiar with the thinking of FDD experts described this scenario, involving an attempted rapprochement between the United States and Iran, as representing to them \u201cthe worst of all possible worlds.\u201d A veto-proof congressional rejection of the agreement would certainly rule out such rapprochement.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to say for sure what FDD ultimately hopes to accomplish with its campaign against the agreement, in part because its experts have not been entirely candid in their arguments. After long invoking the existential threat that an agreement would pose to Israel, May, Dubowitz, and other FDD experts have had little to say about threats to Israel since the agreement was signed. When Dubowitz made a long opening statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on July 29 and when he and FDD\u2019s Juan Zarate issued statements before the Senate Banking Committee on Aug. 5, they mentioned the deal\u2019s effect on Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Yemen, but did not discuss directly what it would mean for Israel. The noun Israel did not appear except in the title of an article in the footnotes to Dubowitz\u2019s statements. May mentioned Israel only once in the three Washington Times columns he wrote opposing the agreement\u2014to warn of how Iran\u2019s \u201chegemonic ambitions\u201d would threaten Israel and the Gulf states. In a column in National Review responding to Obama\u2019s speech at American University, May and Schanzer described the deal\u2019s threat to Americans, but not to Israelis. \u201cIran\u2019s rulers,\u201d they wrote, \u201chave caused thousands of Americans to be killed and maimed in Lebanon, Iraq, and Afghanistan. They continue to openly proclaim their long-term goal: \u2018Death to America.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThere may well be a tactical reason why FDD experts have lately stressed the Iran agreement\u2019s threat to America rather than its threat to Israel. AIPAC has followed the same path in an ad called \u201cWe Need a Better Deal,\u201d which its Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran produced. People at AIPAC and FDD may be worried that they will be accused of acting solely in Israel\u2019s interest or of putting Israel\u2019s interest before that of the United States. But there is a no evidence the FDD experts have done so. Almost certainly, they have all along believed that what was in Israel\u2019s interest in this case was in America\u2019s. But by now soft-pedaling their fears of the agreement\u2019s effect on Israel, they have made it difficult for politicians and the public to evaluate their arguments against a nuclear deal.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with a policy group or lobby demanding that the United States heed the security of another country. The United States is a global power and has an interest in maintaining stability and preventing war even in regions where it is not directly threatened. The issue here is not whether the United States should take Israel\u2019s interest and security into account, but rather what Israel\u2019s interest is and where its security really lies. From its beginning, FDD has interpreted Israel\u2019s interest\u2014whether regionally or in its conflict with the Palestinians\u2014in accordance with what Netanyahu and the Likud party have said it is. But many Israeli military and intelligence experts believe that the nuclear agreement is in Israel\u2019s interest. And the more liberal lobby group J Street\u2014which has far less money but is gaining in numbers and support on AIPAC\u2014argues that the agreement is in both America\u2019s and Israel\u2019s interests.\n\nI recently asked May whether he and his experts had conferred on the Iran deal with the Israeli government, and whether their views on it accorded with the government\u2019s. \u201cWe have listened to French, Jordanians, Germans, Danes, Israelis and others,\u201d he replied. \u201cWe provide analysis and advice when requested. We take instructions from no one. We are neither an embassy nor an editorial page.\u201d Indeed, I\u2019ve seen no evidence that May and FDD \u201ctake instructions\u201d from the Israelis. That\u2019s not the point. It is the degree to which their argument against the Iran agreement hinges on viewing Israel\u2019s and America\u2019s interests the way Netanyahu and the Likud party view them, and whether this view is correct.\n\nThis article was published in collaboration with the American Foreign Policy Project.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:40:00.949+0000"}

From his xenophobic campaign kickoff in New York, to his anti-POW shtick in Iowa, to his misogynistic response to being grilled at the first presidential debate in Ohio, the unlikely White House hopeful has already prompted a series of national conversations his party would have preferred to avoid. What happens next, though, might prove even more uncomfortable for his GOP rivals, because Trump is finally getting specific.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nOn Sunday, The Donald released a policy paper detailing his strategy to combat illegal immigration, the first in a series of issue-specific papers he has promised are on the way. As my colleague Jordan Weissmann rightly noted, Trump\u2019s immigration proposal comes with a few blank spots and might feel a \u201cbit crackpot-ish\u201d but, generally speaking, isn\u2019t really out of line with what we\u2019ve been hearing from a number of Republicans for a while now. Still, in a GOP presidential race long on candidates but so far remarkably short on any specific ideas, the fact that Team Trump is willing to put pen to paper and get specific at all isn\u2019t just newsworthy, it\u2019s potentially game changing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTo date, Trump\u2019s GOP rivals have tried to avoid talking about Trump by dismissing him as a distraction, or declaring that they understand why voters love him (\u201cthey are angry with politics as usual\u201d) without actually engaging him on ideas. They\u2019ve had varying degrees of success in pulling off that trick, but their rationale was at least somewhat justifiable: Trump isn\u2019t a serious candidate, the argument went, so we shouldn\u2019t treat what he says seriously. But now that the real estate tycoon is getting specific in a way much of the rest of the field hasn\u2019t, that argument begins to crumble.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to ignore Trump\u2019s vague bluster, it\u2019s quite another to dismiss a specific policy proposal put forth by a man who is leading you in the polls by double digits. Already, we\u2019re seeing this play out on the campaign trail: Scott Walker spent weeks trying to ignore all things Trump, but at the Iowa State Fair on Monday he told reporters that he, too, wants to build a wall and end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants in the United States illegally.\n\nFor Americans, this and future Trump-created tests are a good thing: Since many GOP contenders have refused to stake out specific policy ground themselves, how they react to Trump\u2019s proposals will allow voters to better place them on the policy spectrum. For the Republican Party, though, this presents a particular problem. Establishment favorites can tack right on an issue like immigration, going towards the current GOP frontrunner with an eye on the primary, or they can inch left with an eye on the general. Either way, with Trump out there talking policy, they will need to choose a lane.

{"entityId": 199, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Olivier Douliery/Getty Images\n\nLast week, it was revealed that Ben Carson had done research on fetuses obtained from the very abortions he would like to ban women from accessing. But being a known hypocrite hasn't slowed the retired neurosurgeon and current GOP presidential candidate down one bit when it comes to casting judgment on women. On the contrary, Carson had a moment on Neil Cavuto\u2019s Fox News show last week that should rival Todd Akin\u2019s infamous \u201clegitimate rape\u201d moment, both in terms of ugliness to women and ignorance of biology.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nWhen asked by Cavuto on Wednesday whether he supported exceptions for rape and incest in his proposed ban on abortion, Carson, like Akin before him, tried to argue that such exceptions weren't really necessary. \u201cI would hope that they would very quickly avail themselves of emergency room,\u201d Carson argued, referring to rape victims. \u201cAnd in the emergency room, they have the ability to administer, you know, RU-486, other possibilities, before you have a developing fetus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs with Akin, it's hard even to know where to begin. The biological ignorance on display here is astounding. RU-486, commonly known as the \u201cabortion pill,\u201d would not be given to a rape victim in an emergency room. The pill can only work on established pregnancies and is usually administered at abortion clinics. The pill Carson is likely thinking of is emergency contraception, which, as its name would suggest, prevents conception in the first place. Anti-choicers who don't like the idea of women having post-sex contraception have frequently claimed that emergency contraception works by killing embryos, but in reality, it works by suppressing women\u2019s ovulation so no conception can occur while she has the live sperm in her system. That Carson, who is an actual doctor, would conflate the two is particularly troubling.\n\nJust as insidious is his implication that a rape victim only deserves our sympathy\u2014or, if you prefer, a rape victim is only legitimate\u2014if she behaves in a certain way after the rape. To earn the right not to bear a child for a rapist by force, you have to pull it together right after the rape and go straight to the emergency room, keeping in mind to avoid Catholic hospitals, even if that means driving for hours out of your way. If you are in shock or denial after your rape or you fear the repercussions of reporting, too bad, so sad. Only the most pulled-together, brave rape victims get to say no to forced pregnancy. And even then, only 89 percent of the time, which is the effectiveness rate of emergency contraception.\n\nBut even though he seems to break with the hard-line anti-choice stance against emergency contraception, Carson continues to appeal to anti-choice voters by going hard after reproductive health care access for women of color.\n\n\u201cThat 30 percent of abortions occur among black women, whereas their population number is 13 percent, so it's almost triple the number of abortions rate for African Americans as whites,\u201d Carson told Fox News host Eric Bolling on Thursday night. \u201cIt brings up a very important issue and that is do those black lives matter? The number one cause of death for black people is abortion.\u201d\n\nComments like this suggest why Carson's popularity is rising among the ranks of conservative voters, who love hearing a black man explain that black women making personal choices about their own lives is a greater threat to black people than police violence or economic inequality. He's not wrong that black women have disproportionately high abortion rates, but that's not because black women are some kind of murderous threat to their own people. It's because black women have much higher unintended pregnancy rates than white women, in no small part because black women are more likely to have inadequate access to affordable gynecological care, including contraception. If black women had the same access to care as white women, these abortion rate discrepancies would likely shrink dramatically.\n\nBut even though we know that contraception access prevents abortion, Carson is pushing for less access, particularly for women of color. \u201cOne of the reasons you find most [Planned Parenthood] clinics in black neighborhoods is so that you can find ways to control that population,\u201d Carson told Cavuto on Wednesday.\n\nHe doubled down on this claim on Thursday, telling Bolling, \u201cAnd it is quite true that the majority and plurality of their clinics are in minority neighborhoods.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn reality, most abortion clinics are in white-majority neighborhoods, and 14 percent of Planned Parenthood patients are black, which is directly proportional to the population at large. But this talking point is a popular one on the right, because under the guise of anti-racism, black women\u2019s access to contraception and other health care services is being targeted for cuts, while white women\u2019s access isn't under nearly as much scrutiny. If conservatives such as Carson had their way, already existing disparities in reproductive health between black and white women would expand dramatically.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:40:40.058+0000"}

That began to change earlier this week, when he expounded on a few policy subjects during an interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity. And now, finally, the man has succumb to the norms of American political discourse and put some of his ideas in writing. On Sunday, Trump released his first position paper. Of course, it's about illegal immigration, his favorite topic.\n\nJordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.\n\nNo. 1 on Trump's to-do list? Build a border wall, and make Mexico pay for it. This is a scheme he has floated before\u2014and Mexico's president has said that, obviously, his country wouldn't cooperate\u2014but now he's detailing more precisely how he'd bludgeon our southerly neighbor into forking over the cash. To wit:\n\nMexico must pay for the wall and, until they do, the United States will, among other things: impound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options]. We will not be taken advantage of anymore.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo, this is what it is. Parts are puzzling. I'm not exactly sure, for instance, how Trump plans to distinguish remittance payments \"derived from illegal wages\" from regular old remittance payments. But, it's probably best to pay attention to the broad strokes: If necessary, Trump is happy to start a trade war and diplomatic struggle with Mexico until it funds a fence.\n\nSay what you will about the merits of this idea, as a marketing strategy it's kind of brilliant. At this point, barking about how we need to build a wall to keep immigrants out is old hat in Republican politics. But demanding that Mexico cover the bill adds a nice, jingoistic edge that freshens the concept up. It's familiar with a twist.\n\nWhich, honestly, kind of describes the overall vibe of Trump's immigration plan. For instance, he wants to end birthright citizenship. Extreme? Sure. But that's already a popular idea among certain Republicans in Congress.1 He wants to cut off money to \"sanctuary cities\" that don't enforce federal immigration law\u2014and, well, the GOP-led house just passed a bill to do exactly that. He also advocates a bunch of basically standard, hard-line positions like increasing deportations and upping the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, and doesn't mention anything about a path to citizenship (though, as Josh Barro recently noted, Trump has made comments suggesting some \"flexibility\" on that subject). Borrowing from immigration skeptics on the left, he would take steps to curb guest worker visas.\n\n\n\nBottom line: Altogether the thing feels a bit crackpot-ish.

The next year the Supreme Court ordered the legislature to seat him.

And, in case that wasn\u2019t enough to get everyone\u2019s attention, Carl Bernstein (of Woodward-and fame) made it more tantalizing when he suggested Friday that if Biden does run, he may do so with the promise that he\u2019d only serve one term.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer.

But Rubio\u2019s critique is more broad. In remarks released early from the address Rubio delivered this morning at an event hosted by the Foreign Policy Initiative in New York on Friday, Rubio accused Obama of having been \u201cquick to deal with the oppressors, but slow to deal with the oppressed.\" He also vowed to roll back the recent diplomatic overtures, should he become president, until \"meaningful political and human rights reforms\" occur. Likewise, he would revoke the Iran nuclear deal, pass \u201ccrushing\u201d new sanctions against Iran, and ensure that any future talks are linked to Iran\u2019s \"broader conduct, from human rights abuses to support for terrorism and threats against Israel.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEvery major GOP candidate has promised to rescind the Iran and Cuba deals. But Rubio goes much farther than the others in his emphasis on democracy and human rights. Much more than rival Floridian Jeb Bush, who has been struggling with how to approach his brother\u2019s Iraq legacy, Rubio is running as the standard-bearer of George W. Bush\u2019s neoconservative \u201cfreedom agenda\u201d\u2014using American power to aggressively promote democracy overseas.\n\nThough the soundbites are good, it\u2019s an odd choice for Rubio. Much of the Republican party, including to some extent, much of the Bush administration, soured on democracy promotion as the Iraq war grew increasingly unpopular and the policy produced unintended consequences such as Hamas\u2019s 2006 Palestinian election victory. Today, Rubio\u2019s rhetoric stands out in an election where his rivals are citing Egyptian strongman Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as a model world leader. (Like Bush, Rubio isn\u2019t a complete purist: His staunch pro-democracy stance evidently doesn\u2019t extend to America\u2019s allies in the Persian Gulf.) The American public also doesn\u2019t seem too interested in making the world safe for democracy these days: Only about 18 percent say spreading democracy should be one of America\u2019s top priorities. For promoting human rights, it\u2019s 33 percent.\n\nRubio\u2019s rhetoric does draw a stark contrast with the current president\u2019s skepticism about democracy promotion. Obama famously told an audience in Cairo in 2009 that \u201cno system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other\u201d and, as he nears the end of his term, is finally putting in place something resembling the pragmatic realist foreign policy he ran on.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:41:47.852+0000"}
{"entityId": 211, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Kay Tobin Lahusen\n\nI was a teenager when I first met Barbara Gittings. Not yet 16 but already a precocious wannabe lesbian activist, I was coming of age in Philadelphia, where Barbara Gittings had been protesting for lesbian and gay rights since before I was born, an open lesbian carrying a picket sign in front of Independence Hall on the Fourth of July. An iconoclast. A leader. A pioneer.\n\nBarbara was tall and sturdy and always looked serious, but she had a ready laugh and was quick to outrage for anything that oppressed those she called \u201cmy people.\u201d She favored embroidered blouses and corduroy pants and was devoted, utterly and implicitly, to lesbians and gay men and the cause of our equality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBorn in 1932 in Vienna, Austria, the daughter of a diplomat in the Foreign Service, Barbara was older than my parents and part of a wholly different civil rights movement than the black civil rights movement I had grown up with. My parents\u2019 activism meant that I\u2019d been raised in activism from infancy. By first grade, I knew who all the black leaders were. But I didn\u2019t know when I met Barbara Gittings that she was the Rosa Parks of lesbian and gay rights.\n\nThe movement Barbara and her cohort of activists introduced me to was a movement I had never heard of until the early period post-Stonewall, when a local Philadelphia underground newspaper, The Distant Drummer, began running little stories on its back pages. It was there that my teenage lesbian self would discover radical lesbians and the Gay Activists Alliance. But first, I discovered the Homophile Action League and its Philadelphia leadership\u2014Byrna Aronson, Ada Bello, Rosalie Davies, and Barbara and her life partner, Kay Tobin Lahusen.\n\nIt\u2019s difficult to articulate how disparate a time that was and how significant a change agent that Barbara Gittings would prove to be. In the era Barbara had come of age\u2014the pre-Stonewall, pre-Internet, pre-fifty different ways to describe your orientation on Facebook era\u2014there was just this vast wasteland of \u201cAm I the only one?!\u201d Into that blank, empty, and scary space of not knowing how to connect with other people like you\u2014other lesbians and gay men, other \u201chomosexuals\u201d\u2014there came the pioneers. Barbara Gittings was one of those: a mother of a movement.\n\nWhen I met Barbara, she\u2019d already been protesting publicly for the rights of \u201chomosexuals\u201d since well before I was born. She\u2019d been out in front of the Liberty Bell\u2014one of the most public of spaces in Philadelphia in those years, swarmed with tourists every day of the week\u2014in her sleeveless dress and short hair. She looked like somebody\u2019s carpooling mom, except her sign read, \u201cHomosexuals should be judged as individuals.\u201d Where did she get the guts to do that?\n\nHow did she decide that it was time for lesbians and gay men to be treated with respect, dignity, and equal rights under the law? What made her think, years before Stonewall, that she could openly declare herself lesbian in the 1950s at the height of the House Un-American Activities Committee witch hunts that targeted homosexuals. How could she parade around in public with a literal sign on her that said, \u201cEquality for homosexuals\u201d? What even made her think we deserved equality when everyone else called us \u201csick,\u201d \u201cperverse,\u201d and an \u201cabomination\u201d? Meeting Barbara Gittings when I was a teenager emboldened me to be a lesbian.\n\nIn the years post-Stonewall, at my all-girls high school, the dress code still demanded that we wear skirts. There was no gender nonconformity allowed. The closest you could get was a black turtleneck and black tights with your miniskirt. Yet, in the midst of all that straight-appearing, anti-feminist-yet-woman-centered, focus-on-college girls\u2019 atmosphere of my academically excellent school, there was an undercurrent that I discovered almost immediately: lesbianism.\n\nThere were lesbians on the faculty who had been there when my mother had attended twenty years earlier\u2014women she warned me to stay away from. There were lesbians in the student body, including the upper class woman who introduced me to lesbianism at a sleepover my freshman year. But no one mentioned the word lesbian, even as we passed purloined copies of ragged old Ann Bannon paperbacks from girl to girl. No one said what couldn\u2019t be said: that for some of us, the kissing at sleepovers wasn\u2019t going to be an adolescent phase, but a lifelong desire. I said it. Barbara Gittings said I could. She was there, at HAL, standing at the coming-out gate, explaining why we had to declare ourselves, burst from the closets and speak our truth\u2014not just for ourselves, she would explain, but for \u201cour people.\u201d\n\nIn that girls-school atmosphere of simmering Sapphistry, I was the girl to break the silence and scandalize my family and the school by being the first to be expelled for being a lesbian and a \u201cbad moral influence\u201d on the hundreds of other girls. That experience at the tender age of not quite 16 turned me into a lifelong activist, and Barbara Gittings was there at HAL, ready to be one of my role models.\n\nWhen I met Barbara, it didn\u2019t occur to me that this woman was older than my mother. Her lesbianism\u2014her overt, blatant, walk-down-the-street-with-her-lover lesbianism\u2014made her my peer, my sister, my comrade. We were in the same marginalized club. I saw her as someone whose activism I wanted to emulate. I saw her as a lifeline out of the heterosexual world that I knew, even then, was not and would never be my world. Barbara, with her no-nonsense approach and her single-minded purposefulness, was a beacon lighting the path to my lesbian activism.\n\nBarbara was a keen role model for any activist. From the first time I met her until the last years of her life when I would run into her at Whole Foods or Giovanni\u2019s Room Bookstore or just see her on the streets of Philadelphia\u2019s gayborhood, always in her characteristic sneakers with her lavender backpack, she was the same: dogged, determined, forceful, a leader. But as a teenager, I had no idea how much Barbara had accomplished, how many risks she had taken, how hard and resistant the ground she broke was. What I did know, or intuit, was how utterly fearless she had seemed to be\u2014and I knew I wanted to be just like that.\n\nDetailing the extraordinary activism of Gittings, Baim breaks her biography down into eight chapters. There\u2019s an opening chapter on Gittings\u2019 early life and a closing chapter on her final years. Another chapter details Gittings\u2019 46-year relationship with Kay Tobin Lahusen, who participated in this book and provided myriad incredible photographs, many of which are now archived in the Manuscripts and Archives Division at the New York Public Library, and which detail Barbara\u2019s activism, the burgeoning gay liberation movement (when lesbians were not yet included in the name), the couple\u2019s relationship, and the major events that occurred throughout the period of Gittings\u2019 activism.\n\nThe other five chapters are each devoted to an aspect of Gittings\u2019 activism, beginning with the 1950s and Gittings\u2019 involvement with Daughters of Bilitis and its publication, The Ladder. This is intriguing, because it is here that readers will see how impatient the twentysomething Gittings was for change. She was already out of the closet and ready to take on \u2026 well, everyone, when she joined DOB and worked her way into a leadership role.\n\nGittings believed that The Ladder, which was founded in 1956 and of which she became editor in 1963, should have been used to address the \u201cexperts\u201d who defined homosexuality as a mental illness and who Gittings asserted were the foundation for anti-gay attitudes in society. A 1964 report from the New York Academy of Medicine had called homosexuality a \u201cpreventable and treatable illness.\u201d Gittings queried that presumption by the NYAM, writing, \u201cIt\u2019s a reminder of the sly, desperate trend to enforce conformity by a \u2018sick\u2019 label for anything deviant.\u201d\n\nIn her foreword, Lillian Faderman notes that Gittings wrote to the NYAM on The Ladder\u2019s stationery, challenging them on their labeling of homosexuality, and that this was the first time anyone had done so. Gittings\u2019 letter was reprinted in The Ladder. Yet, her relationship with DOB became strained. Not everyone was ready to exit the closet, Stonewall was still years away, and millions of lesbians lived in the hinterlands. Even Philadelphia, then the nation\u2019s fourth-largest city and a mere 90 miles from New York City, wasn\u2019t ready for the shift in consciousness that Gittings was calling for.\n\nBaim\u2019s next chapter takes us through Gittings\u2019 protest years. She\u2019d become close friends with Frank Kameny, with whom she was picketing and protesting everywhere: Philadelphia, New York, Washington, D.C. The two of them would lead actions against the Defense Department and the Civil Service Commission. Gittings would be out in her flowered dresses picketing the White House, the United Nations, and Independence Hall.\n\nYet, as extraordinary as those actions were, it is in Baim\u2019s fourth chapter where Gittings takes on the American Psychiatric Association. This is unquestionably the most pivotal chapter in Baim\u2019s book and the one that everyone must read.\n\nWhen I say that as a young child I knew who all the black civil rights leaders were, from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Stokely Carmichael, I did. Those names were always part of the parlance of my household growing up; some, I was fortunate enough to even meet. But when I met Barbara, I had no way of knowing what a remarkable figure she was, because our lesbian and gay history was not being recorded the way the black civil rights movement\u2019s history was. That Barbara was as important to our burgeoning lesbian and gay movement as those key black men and women were to theirs remained unknown to me until years later. Even though I knew Gittings, I didn\u2019t know how much she had already done to pave the way for other activists, and for the lesbian and gay man in the street, as it were. That letter Gittings wrote back before Stonewall rankled. She was determined to tear the sickness label off every lesbian and gay man in America.\n\nAnd, well, she did. You will have to read the actual chapter for the complex details, but Gittings took on the American Psychiatric Association and the DSM (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), which had determined that homosexuality was a mental illness. By the time she was done, the DSM had been changed and lesbians and gay men were no longer\u2014officially at least\u2014considered mentally ill. The story of how she began the public part of the fight she\u2019d been waging behind the scenes for a decade, by buying a booth at the APA convention in 1972 with the banner \u201cGay, Proud, and Healthy: The Homosexual Community Speaks,\u201d is just extraordinary.\n\nGittings also managed to get herself and Kameny on a panel about homosexuality at the 1972 convention. She also found herself a gay psychiatrist to even out the panel that also included two heterosexual psychiatrists. It wasn\u2019t until reading Baim\u2019s book that I discovered that the psychiatrist Gittings found, who appeared in disguise, was Dr. John Fryer, a frequent guest at my parents\u2019 house. All those years, there had been a gay man\u2014the \u201cbachelor\u201d my mother invited for single women\u2014at our dinner table, and I didn\u2019t know. (There are amazing photographs of this APA event in the book; the disguise is a heavy plastic mask.) That was the era of the closet. That was the era Gittings was determined to end.\n\nChapters on Gittings\u2019 protests at the American Library Association and her work getting lesbian and gay issues in front of the news cameras round out the activist chapters of the book. The ALA, which once asked who \u201cthose people\u201d led by Gittings were, and who were getting all the media attention, now has a literary award in her name. Gay Pioneer presents a full portrait of an activist\u2019s life, both public and private. Lahusen\u2019s dozens of extraordinary photographs provide a visual trajectory of Gittings\u2019 life of dedicated service to lesbians and gay men and our equality.\n\nA year or so before her death from breast cancer, I saw Barbara at the annual lesbian and gay film festival in Philadelphia. She suddenly looked like an old woman to me, her hair now white and sparse from the treatments, but she wore one of her characteristic embroidered blouses and there was no hint of frailness about her. We talked breast cancer (she knew I was a survivor), and we talked lesbian activism, and then we went to our respective seats, the lights dimming. It would be the last time I saw her. She died February 18, 2007, at age 74.\n\nGittings described her life of activism this way, in 1999: \u201cAs a teenager, I had to struggle alone to learn about myself and what it meant to be gay. Now, for forty-eight years, I\u2019ve had the satisfaction of working with other gay people all across the country to get the bigots off our backs, to oil the closet door hinges, to change prejudiced hearts and minds, and to show that gay love is good for us and for the rest of the world, too. It\u2019s hard work\u2014but it\u2019s vital, and it\u2019s gratifying, and it\u2019s often fun!\u201d\n\nKameny called her the mother of the movement, and she was definitely that: an omnipresent activist who fought her entire life so that her people could be themselves in the sunlight. I was honored to have known such an ardent activist and to have been under her tutelage as a young lesbian. Baim\u2019s book introduces this stalwart activist to a broad audience, and Gittings\u2019 determination, achievement, and love for her community shines through. We have much to learn from her life of activism, not least of which is why we cannot give up the fight.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:41:51.424+0000"}

{"entityId": 213, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by a katz/Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen I first began writing professionally about the LGBTQ community, I chose not to write about transgender people, their rights, and their struggle, because I was afraid that if I put one foot wrong, I\u2019d be unable to recover my reputation as a writer. Gradually, as I learned more about the trans community and the issues they find important, I eased up on this self-imposed restriction, and while one of my pieces, about cisgender privilege, generated some minor heat, I\u2019ve also written articles describing the spectrum of genderqueer identities, explaining the ways in which legalized same-sex marriage has affected trans people in the state where I live, and exploring the differences between being transgender and \u201ctransracial.\u201d I consider myself both an ally and a participant in the struggle for trans equality, and I continue to look for ways to be a better, stronger, and more solid advocate for transgender rights. Even so, when I look at Ophelia Benson\u2019s situation, I can\u2019t stop myself from imagining that it might have been me trying to get out from under the perception that I am an enemy to trans people.\n\nOphelia Benson, for those who aren\u2019t aware of her work, is a prominent feminist skeptic, a prolific blogger, a co-author of three books, and a columnist for Free Inquiry and the Freethinker.* She\u2019s also at the center of a very bitter argument, which ignited after commenters on her blog and some of her colleagues in the blogging network she was part of came to believe that she holds transphobic views and may oppose the rights and dignity of trans people more strongly than any of her public comments would indicate. The full argument is a complicated, bloggy mess, conducted in dueling blog posts and comments on Free Thought Blogs, a blogging hub Benson belonged to until recently.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe dispute began with a post of Benson's that criticized the way oppressive female beauty standards were being reinforced in the analysis of Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Vanity Fair cover. It was compounded by another post that voiced agreement with parts of Elinor Burkett\u2019s controversial (and I would say transphobic) New York Times op-ed, and then compounded quite a few more times as tempers frayed, feelings were hurt, and the blogging community at Free Thought melted down. Benson, who is 67, has struggled with both the language and the substance of how we talk about gender at a moment when trans issues have become so central to gender discussions of all sorts. This isn\u2019t really surprising for a woman whose views were initially formed in the absence of such debates, and she seems at times to be scrambling to catch up. Her detractors, however, believe that Benson\u2019s writing betrays an emerging pattern of hostility to trans people, particularly trans women, and that it is their duty to speak out against her.\n\nBenson is a combative, prickly sort of writer (or as she puts it, \u201cforthright\u201d), but when I spoke to her on Monday about the trouble she\u2019s landed herself in, there was nothing callous or mean-spirited in her remarks about the trans community. When, for instance, I asked if she considers herself an ally of trans people, she told me:\n\nOne reason I wasn\u2019t really vocal about [being a trans ally] before was because I knew it could be a third rail. I\u2019d have liked to have been more of a supporter, but I was afraid that if I mentioned it at all, then something would go wrong. It\u2019s not really my field, not something I\u2019d been reading about, not really my subject.\n\n\u201cI do absolutely consider myself an ally,\u201d she reiterated later in our conversation. \u201cThat means being aware of what it means to be trans, it means taking [trans people] at their word when they talk about their experience, and it means standing up for them if you hear someone attack them.\u201d\n\nThese statements make it hard to see Benson as an enemy of trans people or trans rights\u2014in fact, it\u2019s probably fairer to call her an ally, albeit a complicated one. Complicated allies, and complications in being a good ally, are hardly unique to the transgender rights movement. Every social justice movement has something of a love/hate relationship with its allies.\n\nIn Benson\u2019s case, the complication is that her perspective was informed by a particular strain of feminism, one where gender is seen as a socially constructed mechanism whose primary function is to oppress women. Reconciling this view of gender with sex or gender changes, or with the idea that some people experience a strong sense of their own gender that may be innate or formed in very early childhood, can be a pretty tall order. Intellectual fashions change, and the radicalism of yesterday can become the retrograde conservatism of today with breathtaking speed.\n\nComplicating matters even further, Benson, like many others in her school of feminism, has a very fraught relationship to being female. She describes herself as \u201cgender nonconforming\u201d and has said that she doesn\u2019t really \u201cfeel like\u201d a woman or identify with being a woman outside of feminism. Femaleness is something she and others in her camp see as having been imposed on them unwillingly. These are complicated feelings\u2014and angry ones\u2014and women who experience femaleness in this way could use a chance to talk through their experience of their own gender and how it might relate to that of transgender or genderqueer people. It\u2019s unfortunate and troubling if the rules of engagement for trans-friendly discourse are so inviolable that they end up stifling the ability of some people to express their personal relationship to their own gender.\n\nThese are tricky needles to thread. It\u2019s impossible to nail down the exact spot where productive dialogue stops and hurtful speech begins, so arguing about which exact word or phrase or sentence crosses the line is pointless. Anyone who wishes to be an ally of a marginalized group must necessarily give up some of their cherished right to self-expression, recognizing that some thoughts, even valuable ones, may not be worth expressing in a particular way if that would needlessly cause pain to others. Although it\u2019s often derided as the dreaded \u201cpolitical correctness,\u201d a willingness to speak carefully and weigh the consequences of a poorly worded thought is important for those of us who grew up in a racist, sexist, or (in this case) transphobic cultural environment. After all, our thinking and expression has been forever warped by those forces of intolerance, and those attitudes have a nasty way of popping up in our speech when they\u2019re not wanted. On the other hand, it\u2019s impossible to learn or grow if one isn\u2019t allowed to take missteps. There has to be some leeway for allies to make their mistakes, however annoying those mistakes may be.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:42:02.859+0000"}

The location accuracy was within about 3 feet. He wrote in a Medium post on May 26:\n\nYou may not believe that there are enough of these location tagged messages to provide truly invasive data on any one person, since they must be on mobile, with GPS on, and choose to share their location for it to be sent\u2026 right?\n\nWhat you should keep in mind is that the mobile app for Facebook Messenger defaults to sending a location with all messages.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nKhanna explained that he wanted to publish the extension so people could understand the potential implications of the geolocation sharing and make an informed choice about whether they were OK with leaving it enabled.\n\nFacebook was not pleased. Boston.com reports that first the company asked Khanna not to talk to the press about his project, then it told him to remove the extension. He did both, but finally Facebook told him that he'd lost his internship. Nine days after Khanna published his Medium post, the company pushed an update for Messenger that closed the location sharing loophole.\n\nFacebook said in an email statement that it had started working on the Messenger update months before. It added, \u201cthis mapping tool scraped Facebook data in a way that violated our terms, and those terms exist to protect people's privacy and safety.\u201d Khanna noted to Boston.com that the data his extension pulled was from users' own messages, meaning it was data they already had full access to whether or not they used his tool. Khanna ended up getting an internship at a different startup for the summer.\n\n\"People who make things and people who break things are not natural allies.\" Josephine Wolff wrote that on Slate Thursday after the security lead at software maker Oracle published a blog post Monday condeming people for discovering and sharing bugs in Oracle's products. Even when companies offer bug bounty programs, the reaction when someone exposes a problematic vulnerability is notoriously unpredictable. The Oracle rant, which has since been taken down, was a particularly, um, candid look at how threatened many companies feel when outsiders find problems with their code. But by going on the defensive rather than embracing scrutiny, companies miss the opportunity to get skilled hackers on their sides.\n\n\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t dismiss employees for exposing privacy flaws, but we do take it seriously when someone misuses user data and puts people at risk,\u201d Facebook said.

{"entityId": 216, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Charlie Leight/Getty Images\n\nLook around the landscape of American politics, and one thing is clear: Voters are furious. On one side, they\u2019re angry about Barack Obama, immigration, and the perceived impotence of their elected officials. On the other, they\u2019re angry about Wall Street, economic inequality, and a government that has\u2014in their view\u2014been captured by billionaire plutocrats.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nThis anger, notes Philip Rucker for the Washington Post, is key to the puzzle of summer 2015, where political life has come to resemble a hackneyed episode of The West Wing. As of this week, real estate tycoon and reality television star Donald Trump commands press attention and (not coincidentally) a strong lead in the Republican presidential primary, while Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2014a self-described socialist on the periphery of American politics\u2014is the leading opponent to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic contest, with a tentative lead in the New Hampshire primary. Here\u2019s Rucker with analysis from party strategists and other campaign professionals:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a longing for real authenticity in politics today,\u201d said Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who is advising Sanders. \u201cPeople feel that the candidates are too manufactured, there\u2019s not enough spontaneity. They want someone who, even if they don\u2019t agree with them, is telling it like they see it, really leveling with voters. I see that with Bernie and I think with Trump, too. It\u2019s resonating very powerfully.\u201d \u2026\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a disquiet, discomfort, and angst that so many people are feeling,\u201d said GOP pollster Whit Ayres, who advises Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.). \u201cThey\u2019re scared economically, they\u2019re scared about what\u2019s happening with our adversaries, and it makes them really, really uncomfortable with where the country\u2019s going and where the leaders are going.\u201d\n\nAs much as Americans hate politicians, they never seem to throw the bums out.\n\nTo a degree, this is boilerplate. In an environment like this one\u2014or the 2012 Republican primaries, where candidates like Herman Cain and Newt Gingrich had their time in the spotlight\u2014voters are angry with the status quo is the only explanation that makes sense. At the same time, that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s true. Yes, Sanders and Trump are unexpectedly popular, but how angry are American voters, really? Are they unsatisfied with the status quo, or is this just sound and fury, signifying nothing?\n\nJudging from what we hear, the answer is yes, voters are angry, and even outraged. Just 19 percent of Americans trust Washington to \u201cdo what is right\u201d either most of the time or all of the time. The remainder, 81 percent, are deeply skeptical. The same goes for trust in Congress. In 2014, according to Gallup, 15 percent of Americans approved of Congress\u2014the second-lowest rating in 40 years of polling. The lowest rating was the year before, when 14 percent of Americans approved of Congress. And in a CNN poll from last year, before the midterm elections, 30 percent of Americans said they were \u201cvery angry\u201d with the direction of the country, while 38 percent said they were \u201csomewhat angry.\u201d\n\nBut instead of polls, let\u2019s judge from what we see, and specifically, how voters act. For as much as Americans hate politicians, they never seem to throw the bums out. On Election Day 2014, Americans sent 396 incumbents back to Washington out of 416 who ran for reelection, for an incumbency rate of 95 percent. In 2012 the rate was 90 percent for House members and 91 percent for senators, and in 2010 it was 85 percent and 84 percent, respectively. You have to go back to 1986 for a Senate re-election rate that isn\u2019t at or near 80 percent. The House is even worse; since 1964, at least 80 percent of incumbents have been re-elected.\n\nThe presidency is different, but Americans have never lacked for alternatives or unusual choices. And yet, in every presidential race since 1972\u2014from the primaries to the general election\u2014voters have looked to mainstream candidates to lead parties and govern the country.\n\nNone of this means voters aren\u2019t sincere about their anger or their disdain for Washington. But it does suggest, strongly, that this anger is a little performative; that\u2014when push comes to shove and Americans have to choose a president, and not just show their disapproval\u2014they go with what they know.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:42:35.112+0000"}
{"entityId": 217, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Image by kpatyhka/Shutterstock\n\nTo my friends in the news business: Yes, I block your advertising, or at least some of it. Yes, I block your videos, or at least some of them. Yes, I block you and your business \u201cpartners\u201d from tracking my every online move.\n\nAnd yes, I recognize that this may cause you some financial difficulties. But you've given me little choice. Blame yourselves, not your audience.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI'm among the growing legions of people who are fed up with what you and the advertising business have done to my online experience. To sum up, you've damn near ruined it.\n\nPlease don't misunderstand. I don't hate advertising. In some cases I welcome it. For example, I subscribe to several magazines about the GNU/Linux operating system and other free and open-source software, and their advertising, in print and online, is highly relevant to my interests in this arena. I also recognize that ads are one of the many revenue streams news organizations need to pay for journalism. (Supporting journalism only through advertising, however, is not a great long-range strategy.)\n\nThe problem is that the advertising ecosystem has spun wildly out of control. As knowledgeable critics have pointed out, it's more often a giant mess: megabytes of junkware loaded onto Web pages, slowing our browsing to a crawl and spying on us in ways that we can't possibly understand, much less condone.\n\nIt's especially obnoxious for media organizations to install countless trackers even when I pay subscription fees. That seems like punishment for doing the right thing.\n\nAnd it's getting worse. A new report claims publishers and ad companies are losing billions to the countermeasures that I and so many others have deployed: browser plugins that block ads and trackers. Not only do I prevent the mysterious tracking companies from spying on me, but I also get faster-loading, slimmed-down pages. And I'm far, far from alone; blocking ads and trackers has become a significant value-add for millions of users, even if it's a value-subtract for the media industry.\n\nI'm uncomfortable with my stance in some ways, because I don't want to harm people's ability to create useful information. So I understand when sites don't work as well\u2014I'm never clear if this is retaliation or just loss of functionality. And it's entirely fair for sites to remind me that I'm blocking ads and ask me to kindly unblock the ads or subscribe. (Sometimes I do.)\n\nThe advertising and tracking industries, abetted by telecommunications carriers, are investing in all kinds of technologies aimed at thwarting users' wishes to retain some control over their online activities, including \u201csuper-cookies\u201d from two mobile providers. Verizon actually launched this feature, and AT&T tested it, but they backed down after the public and privacy advocates discovered what was going on. We can count on these industries to push harder and more sneakily to prevent us from avoiding their grip.\n\nThere was a moment of hope when an initiative called \u201cDo Not Track\u201d appeared several years ago. The idea was that our browsers would come with an option to ask companies to honor our request that we not be spied on by third parties. (I have no objection when a site I'm visiting puts a software cookie on my computer so it knows when I return\u2014that\u2019s different than third-party trackers that follow you around the Internet.) Unfortunately, the Web industry as a whole reacted by essentially ignoring the user requests.\n\nContempt for user privacy is the norm, of course. This is why the American Civil Liberties Union, Electronic Frontier Foundation, and other groups gave up recently on supposed negotiations to create a voluntary code of conduct for the use of facial-recognition technologies\u2014negotiations, convened by federal authorities, in which the tech industry flatly refused to consider any limitations at all. This is why I have my doubts about a new Do Not Track proposal being pushed by the EFF and others, because I zero faith in the ad/tracking industry's willingness to compromise.\n\nThe online industry could do better, notes writer and programmer Marco Arment:\n\nIt has never been easier to collect small direct payments online, cutting out the advertising middlemen and selling directly to your true customers. For publishers who want to remain ad-supported, ethically and tastefully presented native advertising, such as sponsored posts in feeds and our community\u2019s podcast ads, has proven to be more effective, more profitable, and less user-hostile by far compared to awful network <script> embeds.\n\nI hope he's right, because the alternative\u2014barring government mandates\u2014is a continued arms race.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:42:46.915+0000"}
{"entityId": 218, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images\n\nAfter every loutish performance, political analysts pronounce Donald Trump\u2019s presidential bid finally dead. Surely he cannot recover, they insist, from libeling all Mexicans, denigrating the military heroism of Sen. John McCain, or making crude insinuations about the popular Fox News host Megyn Kelly. But somehow, his predicted demise fails to materialize. Instead, new polls appear showing the billionaire property mogul to be more popular than ever. By most measures, Trump now leads the Republican field by a substantial margin.\n\nJacob Weisberg Jacob Weisberg is chairman and editor-in-chief of The Slate Group and author of The Bush Tragedy. Follow him on Twitter.\n\nWhat could possibly be the attraction of this puffed-up billionaire buffoon? The first thing to say about the Trump phenomenon is that a mutually gratifying symbiosis with the press drives his popularity. Polls at this stage in the election cycle essentially track how much news coverage a candidate receives. Media attention propels Trump\u2019s numbers, and his numbers justify more coverage. His candidacy makes the primaries into a remunerative and enjoyable story, even though everyone knows it is guaranteed to fall to pieces by the time the primaries get fully rolling in February.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut being a nonviable choice does not mean that Trump is not going to affect the outcome of the presidential race. Pat Buchanan, another unelectable Republican protest candidate, arguably cost President George H.W. Bush re-election in 1992. And should he choose to run as a third-party candidate after being denied the nomination, Trump would more or less guarantee victory for Hillary Clinton, the presumptive Democratic nominee, much in the way that Ralph Nader cost Al Gore the presidency in 2000.\n\nAnother obvious explanation for the Trump phenomenon is that he appeals to people who dislike politics. Professional politicians often claim they are not professional politicians. Trump genuinely isn\u2019t one. Politicians try to make friends, build constituencies, and avoid gaffes. Trump does the opposite, seeking out land mines in order to detonate them. At the point when any ordinary outsider candidates would begin conforming to conventions of political behavior, he continues to flout them. Playing an ego and ratings game while his competitors are playing a policy and votes game injects an entertaining element of zaniness and unpredictability into the proceedings.\n\nTrump is the only 69-year-old white guy in America who gets to live like a rap star.\n\nBut Trump is not merely a clown stumbling into a drama and playing it for laughs. His success speaks to two species of resentment that appear intermittently in American political life. The first is xenophobia. The men who are perhaps the most plausible Republican nominees, Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio, identify with or as Latinos and appreciate that their party faces a dim future without them. Trump, who crashed the gate without an invitation, couldn\u2019t care less what happens to the party. This frees him to insult Mexicans as rapists and drug dealers, slandering not only illegal immigrants but all Hispanics. Americans who share his prejudice against foreigners have no other advocate who speaks so openly.\n\nThe second form of resentment Trump channels concerns social class. The last effective exponent of this political undercurrent was Sarah Palin, before she quit her job as governor of Alaska to make money as a celebrity. What is curious about the Palin-Trump style of cultural populism is that it has little to do with the growing economic disparities in American life. The resented betters are social elites in the media, politics, and Hollywood, whom less educated, lower-middle-class Americans regard as behaving in a condescending or hypocritical way.\n\nBy contrast, Trump\u2019s relationship to his own wealth conveys an honesty that his followers say they like. Though he built his empire out of his father\u2019s empire, he has never suffered from the sense of decorum or noblesse oblige that sometimes accompany inherited money. His style isn\u2019t even nouveau riche so much as it is last-week-lottery-winner. To Trump, being a billionaire means plating everything in gold and slapping his name everywhere in huge block letters. It means that he gets to say whatever pops into his head and never has to say he is sorry. His celebrity \u201cbrand\u201d is an alpha-male fantasy of wealth and power, revolving around the pleasure he takes in firing and suing people who displease him. He is the only 69-year-old white guy in America who gets to live like a rap star.\n\nRather than creating envy, the public role Trump enacts validates the aspirations of his admirers. His popularity is an expression of reverse identity politics, which turns white males from defendants into plaintiffs in the contest of victims. He and his followers fixate on political correctness that disallows their grievances about the social transformation under way. His braggadocio and misogyny speak to male privilege lost. His male supporters regard his crude sexism not as juvenile behavior but as a transgressive political statement.\n\nIn all of this, Trump\u2019s closest point of comparison is less to any previous American politician than to Silvio Berlusconi in Italy. Both boast about their wealth, their brilliance, and the beautiful women they attract. The key difference is that Trump does not take himself all that seriously as a demagogue, lacking the self-discipline and long-range calculation. He is essentially a narcissist taking his ego out for a joy ride.

They grew even more excited this week when she took another swing at the real estate mogul by forcefully denouncing his apparent suggestion that it wasn\u2019t Megyn Kelly but instead Kelly\u2019s hormones that was behind the tough questions he faced Thursday night. \u201cI\u2019ve had lots of men imply that I was unfit for decision-making because maybe I was having my period\u2014so I'll say it, OK?\u201d Fiorina told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Sunday, adding: \u201cThe point is, women understood that comment and, yes, it is offensive.\u201d As GOP strategist Kellyanne Conway told the paper: \u201cDonors have looked at her as the answer to Hillary, but I think a lot more donors will now see her as the answer to Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn the campaign trail to date, attacking Trump hasn\u2019t ended particularly well for anyone but Trump\u2014as Lindsey Graham, Rick Perry, and Scott Walker can attest to. But Fiorina has so far avoided the Trump-ing that usually follows such attacks. The best The Donald\u2019s been able to muster was this (for him) relatively muted response on Twitter: \u201cI just realized that if you listen to Carly Fiorina for more than ten minutes straight, you develop a massive headache. She has zero chance!\u201d For anyone prone to see his Kelly comments as blatant misogyny, that tweet didn\u2019t help his cause.\n\nFiorina\u2019s attacks are coming at an opportune time for both her and her party. For Fiorina, they offer the chance to turn a dominating performance at the early Fox News debate into something more lasting. As FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Harry Enten points out, Carly was the only Republican hopeful to see her support grow in the first seven polls conducted after the Cleveland debates. If the night had a winner, then, she was it. But that means little if she can\u2019t extend and preserve that momentum to snag a spot on the main stage at the second GOP debate, which is being hosted by CNN next month.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:42:58.101+0000"}

The New York Times is covering the \"cuckservative\" phenomenon, which must have been a hard editorial decision\u2014it's impossible to talk about this while maintaining the paper's famous sense of decorum. \"The phrase has caught on among a segment of disaffected Republicans, some of whom hold white nationalist ideologies and who feel many of the party\u2019s presidential candidates are not conservative enough,\" explains writer Alan Rappeport.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nIn other words, it's a new and uglier way to call someone a \"RINO.\" But where does it come from?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\"Cuckservative is an amalgamation of the word cuckold \u2014 the husband of an adulterous woman \u2014 and conservative,\" Rappeport explains. \"The implication is that mainstream Republicans, like jilted husbands, are facing humiliation and have lost sight of their futures.\"\n\nThat's one way to put it. Another way to put it: The term is drawn from a popular form of pornography in which men get off on the fantasy of a woman humiliating her man by cheating on him. A lot of it is what you might delicately call \"racial,\" wherein the white male viewer eroticizes the humiliation of having your wife cheat on you with a black man. (Vice, bless them, has an entertaining review of one cuckold porn imagining former Los Angeles Clippers owner and noted racist Donald Sterling in such a scenario. This surprisingly sober-minded discussion on Reddit is also in understanding the phenomenon.)\n\nAs Rappeport notes, cuckservative tends to be flung around by some of the more racist elements of the Republican party, something easy enough to confirm via Twitter search, whereby you can watch a lot of hollering about immigration and exhibiting some weird defensiveness about white male virility. All of which makes sense, even if it's stomach-churning sense. Racist ideology has always been about asserting the \"purity\" of white people\u2014particularly white women\u2014against the supposedly corrupting influence of non-white people. Racist cuckold porn pushes two big buttons for the far right: a sense of ownership over women's bodies and a fear of black men. It's gross but not particularly surprise to see them eroticize their ugly paranoias.\n\nSo cuckservative boils down to this: white supremacists insinuating that white male politicians are emasculated if they fail to take a sufficiently racist hard line against immigration and race-mixing.\n\nThe larger story here is one of the far-right fringe gaining a foothold in mainstream Republican politics. Fringe anti-abortion types have managed to get their vendetta against Planned Parenthood mainstreamed, and now the scary racists are making the same move, using Donald Trump as their wedge: His jibber-jabber about Mexican immigrants and rape plays off their favorite obsession.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:42:59.112+0000"}

Unfortunately, if money goes to the root of the problem, as Lessig says, these reforms would have little impact. In the best case, they would enhance the popular vote in elections by a little bit. They might enhance by a small amount cash contributions from low-income people. And Republican-dominated state legislatures would lose some of their power to create safe seats.\n\nThird, it would provide for \u201ccitizen-funded elections.\u201d All voters would be given vouchers that they could use to contribute to political campaigns, and small contributions would be matched from public funds. Rules blocking government officials from becoming lobbyists would be strengthened.\n\nSecond, it would guarantee \u201cequal representation\u201d by banning gerrymandering of districts. Lessig also endorses an idea called \u201cranked-choice voting,\u201d where voters rank the candidates rather than vote for just one. The candidate who receives the highest aggregate ranking wins. (You can find the somewhat complicated details here .)\n\nLessig says that his sole mission as president would be to persuade Congress to pass the Citizen Equality Act , which would implement three reforms to the political system. First, it would guarantee the \u201cequal right to vote\u201d by enhancing the power of the federal government to control how states conduct elections, requiring states to provide for online or automated voter registration, and shifting Election Day to a national holiday.\n\nNot everyone agrees with Lessig\u2019s diagnosis. Political polarization and loss of faith in government long predate the modern era of money politics, as Ezra Klein has pointed out . It is also worth mentioning that Big Money has not blocked significant progressive legislative accomplishments of recent years\u2014which have created quasi-universal health insurance, stricter financial regulation, and slightly more progressive taxes. But Lessig is certainly right that money in politics is a problem, and something should be done about it.\n\nFor Lessig, as for Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the \u201csystem is rigged.\u201d In his 2011 book Republic, Lost , he argues that money has corrupted politics. The problem is not bribery in the old-fashioned sense. Nor does Lessig believe that the problem is simply that interest groups obtain favorable legislation by making campaign contributions, bribery with a wink, as one might call it. Lessig believes that politicians and lobbyists are decent, law-abiding, and (even) ethical people who are caught up in a system of mutual dependence where money influences political outcomes without leaving any tracks. Understaffed and thinly spread members of Congress rely on lobbyists to inform them and even write the legislation, depending on the lobbyists more for their expertise, goodwill, and even friendship than for campaign cash. Lobbyists provide much-needed aid but always with a slant, reflecting their particular view of the world, which is not that of most Americans. The result is that, without anyone quite meaning it, law reflects moneyed interests while ordinary Americans are shut out. This has led to political polarization and loss of faith in democracy.\n\nOn Tuesday Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard law professor, announced that he would run for president if he receives $1 million in donations by Labor Day. Lessig\u2019s plan is decidedly idiosyncratic\u2014he has never held political office, and he declares that he will resign and hand over the orb of power to his vice president as soon as something called the Citizen Equality Act is signed into law. But Lessig, who is brilliant and influential (I know him slightly), has approached his presidential campaign with characteristic creativity. And if he can bring some serious worries about the corrupting effect of money in politics to public attention, his efforts deserve support or at least sympathy.\n\nBut in the economy of political influence that Lessig describes in his book, none of these things can make much difference. Most Americans are terribly uninformed about the political process and rely on very crude proxies (such as endorsements or partisan identification) to determine how to vote. Many people fail to vote not because of barriers to voting but because they\u2019d rather spend their time doing something else. Candidates who suited voters a bit better because of ranked-choice voting (assuming it works as advertised) and who received more small donations from low-income people would still need to rely on well-informed lobbyists with whom they had relationships and would still benefit from massive infusions of cash from big business. Lessig\u2019s cure just doesn\u2019t follow from his diagnosis.\n\nThe current disaffection with the government probably reflects the ideological polarization of the electorate, which is an input, not an output, of the political process. People disagree with one another more than in the past, so\u2014whatever compromises the government reaches over policy\u2014they are more likely to be unhappy with it. If people feel that they have no influence on political outcomes, that\u2019s in part because we live in a huge and diverse country, and so even in an ideal system where your vote counts as much as anyone else\u2019s, it\u2019s just one of more than a hundred million.\n\nSo there is a mismatch between Lessig\u2019s means\u2014a dramatic run for office as an unprecedented \u201creferendum president\u201d who resigns as soon as his mandate is legislated\u2014and his goal, which is at best incremental reform. In the past, he has argued with a great deal more persuasiveness that the only way to reform the political system is through a constitutional convention, and it is easier to see the logic of this position than to understand his campaign goals. Constitutional amendments really could go to the root of the problem\u2014by limiting campaign contributions (and thus overturning Citizens United, which held that the First Amendment banned certain limits on political expenditures), restructuring the Senate (which is a highly unrepresentative body that favors rural interests), limiting the power of the Supreme Court, and perhaps creating a parliamentary system or something like it, which would avoid the twin problems of gridlock and presidential abuse of power that have long been troubling features of our system of separation of powers.\n\nBut most calls for constitutional conventions come these days from conservatives, who want to impose a balanced budget on the federal government and who have no interest in adopting Lessig\u2019s electoral reforms\u2014nearly all of which would benefit the Democratic party in the short term. And the results of a constitutional convention\u2014where moneyed interests as well as all kinds of interest groups would play a big role\u2014are unpredictable. Well, not entirely unpredictable. Under the amendment process of the Constitution, state legislatures can play an important role in selecting delegates and ratifying amendments. And while there is a means to circumvent their formal participation, they would probably influence the outcome. This matters. Republicans have vastly more control over state legislatures than Democrats do\u2014in part because of the gerrymandering Lessig wants to end\u2014so we can be pretty certain about the ideological tilt of any amendments that might ultimately be ratified, if not their content.\n\nThis is probably why Lessig has not adopted his earlier proposal of a constitutional convention to his presidential run. The rot goes too deep. But it also should raise doubts about whether the Citizen Equality Act can do any good.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:43:04.763+0000"}

Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nSometimes we forget about the 40-odd\u2013year Cold War between the former Soviet Union and the West. We forget about the espionage, sabotage (on both sides), the covert and proxy wars, and even the overt arms race. Since 1991 a sort of public indifference to Russia\u2019s antics has developed, despite its nuclear saber rattling, its annexation of Crimea, and its ongoing provocative posture. Sure, the United States and the European Union sanction Russia for its actions in Ukraine, but there is little public outcry. Sure, the incoming chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff tells Congress that Russia is the \u201cgreatest\u201d threat to the U.S., but no one really seems to believe it.\n\nNow Russia has (allegedly) hacked the unclassified email system of the Joint Chiefs and its roughly 2,500 supporting employees. The rather limited news we have is that Russia is the \u201cprime suspect,\u201d and that the attack was highly \u201csophisticated\u201d and looks to be the work of a state or state-sponsored group. We really only have three pieces of information to date: There was a sophisticated spear phishing attack; the breach affected only the Joint Chiefs\u2019 unclassified system; and it was \u201ctraced\u201d to Russia. Taken in isolation this attack seems pretty inconsequential. But it\u2019s just the latest in a string of incidents, like the other Russian hack on the Defense Department a mere four months ago, as well as the hacks last year at the White House and State Department. Overall, there\u2019s been an uptick in cyber-escapades emanating from Russia since the beginning of the current sanctions regime. Indeed, it looks to be part and parcel of a wider strategy toward a New Cold War. The only difference is that the old \u201cdeterrence\u201d strategy won\u2019t work, especially against cyberattacks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf we want to put the Joint Chiefs hack into context, we ought to do so within a wider explanation and strategic perspective. First, Russia\u2019s position within the international system is one of a waning power. On most metrics, such as population growth, economic strength, and military capacity, Russia has steadily declined since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Such a reversal of prominence places Russia in what some might call a \u201cdomain of losses\u201d\u2014a point at which a leader sees herself in a crisis and becomes more risk-acceptant to try to regain her former prominent position. Contrarily, if she were in a \u201cdomain of gains,\u201d she might be more risk-averse. It\u2019s a bit like cashing in one\u2019s chips at the poker table. Russia is in the position of trying to win back what she once had and so is more likely to engage in risky and escalatory behavior.\n\nSecond, we must remember that Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s perspective and influence are extremely important. His history as a former KBG officer, and an officer who witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall in East Germany in 1989, is formative to his identity and his belief structure. As historian and journalist Jerrold Schecter argues, \u201cPutin\u2019s character and his core beliefs, ingrained in his world view and behavior, stem from a conflicted m\u00e9lange of Tsarist authoritarianism and Marxist-Leninism.\u201d In short, he is a Bolshevik. A Bolshevik must use everything at his disposal to win, and that includes deception, attempts to falsify reality, weaken one\u2019s opponent, and escalate conflicts to the extreme.\n\nCyber-\u201cweapons\u201d are unlike normal munitions; you can\u2019t \u201cpatch\u201d an atomic weapon.\n\nPutin rejects the post\u2013Cold War balance of power, and this is no secret. His attempts to regain or punish lost satellite states, as well as to harass Western powers, are nothing new. Moreover, his explicit rejection of American dominance means that he will rarely compromise or utilize more pacific means to regain Russian power. He would rather modernize his arsenal, engage in destabilizing activities, and use escalatory rhetoric.\n\nWhat then of the Joint Chiefs hack? This is one more weapon in his arsenal, and it is a relatively costless one. If Russia is truly engaging in \u201chybrid warfare\u201d\u2014in which it will utilize military and nonmilitary tools, such as cyber-operations\u2014then the Joint Chiefs hack is only one battle amid a much larger campaign. The hack on the email system is just the most current and visible exploit in a series of cyber-salami tactics. The worry, however, is what the aims of this new campaign are. If Russia is beginning to wage a New Cold War, what is the U.S. willing to do in response?\n\nThe logic of Cold War deterrence and mutually assured destruction won\u2019t work in this new domain. First, the so-called attribution problem makes any escalatory response dangerous. The level of uncertainty as to who is \u201creally\u201d behind a cyberattack drives just enough of a wedge to tamper any intensification in force. For instance, there was enough dismay at Russia sending in unidentified \u201clittle green men\u201d into Crimea with military uniforms but without official insignia. Russia denied its actions here, and in this instance had obvious state-owned military hardware for the world to see. In the case of a cyberattack, there is weaker circumstantial evidence linking the government of Russia to any particular attack. In the Crimea case, we can infer that Russia ordered the tanks there; with the hack, we are less certain whether there was an official order, or whether the attacks were loyalists acting of their own accord, or whether someone spoofed a Russian IP address. Moreover, if the U.S. engaged in a cyber\u2013tit-for-tat, we risk losing the advantage the weapon once it is used. Cyber-\u201cweapons\u201d rely on an exploit, or weakness, in software, hardware, or networks. Once someone knows about the vulnerability, they can fix it and the \u201cweapon\u201d is no longer useful. Thus, cyber-\u201cweapons\u201d are unlike normal munitions; you can\u2019t \u201cpatch\u201d an atomic weapon.\n\nSecond, deterrence\u2014in the classic, Cold War sense\u2014really only works when one side can prove that it will survive a terrible attack long enough to wipe out the other side. The hack on the Joint Chiefs is clearly not in the same ballpark as threatening nuclear war. Indeed, the most one can do is \u201cname and shame,\u201d though the White House is rather tightlipped at the moment.\n\nWhat about nonlethal \u201cdeterrence,\u201d in the sense of getting an actor to refrain from doing something because it would be too costly for him? Well, what might we threaten to make it too costly? Surely it can\u2019t be a proportionate response, for the logic of deterrence works on it being disproportionate. Would sanctions do it? Doubtful, as we are already sanctioning Russia. What about a show of force? Even more doubtful, for why would we do something like that against a nuclear-armed adversary that has shown predilections of escalating? Especially for the \u201coffense\u201d of hacking an unclassified email system\u2014clearly that isn\u2019t an act of war.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:43:24.805+0000"}

To think so, or to think they\u2019ll change the race, is to say that scandal will override partisanship; that an otherwise liberal voter will walk into the ballot booth and mark the box for Jeb Bush or Gov. Scott Walker or Sen. Marco Rubio because of digital mismanagement. I liked what Clinton said about early childcare, thinks our hypothetical voter, but sending government email on a private server makes her unfit for the White House.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nAt the same time, Clinton\u2019s email isn\u2019t irrelevant. For journalists and other observers, it offers an important look at how she operates. That Clinton used private email at all shows her flexible approach to rules and regulations and a secretive reflex for conducting official business. \u201cUsing a personal email account exclusively is a potent prescription for flouting the Federal Records Act and circumventing the Freedom of Information Act,\u201d explained Daniel Metcalfe, former director of the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Information Policy, to PolitiFact. \u201cAnd there can be little doubt that Clinton knew this full well.\u201d It may not matter to voters, but it\u2019s important to know if Clinton plans to carry this secrecy\u2014and public evasiveness\u2014to the Oval Office, if she\u2019s elected president. (Here, it\u2019s worth noting that, as Florida governor, Jeb Bush also conducted business from a personal account, and didn\u2019t release his correspondence for seven years.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTo that point, there\u2019s a new plot point in the ongoing drama of Clinton\u2019s email account. On Tuesday, reported the New York Times, Clinton \u201cdirected her aides to give the Justice Department an email server that housed the personal account that she used exclusively while secretary of state, along with a thumb drive that contained copies of the emails.\u201d\n\nThis follows testimony from I. Charles McCullough, inspector general for the intelligence community, who told Congress that Clinton had \u201ctop secret\u201d information in two emails among the 40 private messages received from the State Department, which has access to a full trove of 30,000 messages.\n\nIf some people start to rethink Hillary Clinton\u2019s electability, I won\u2019t blame them.\n\nSince March, when her private account was uncovered, Clinton has denied the presence of classified information in her account. \u201cI am confident that I never sent or received any information that was classified at the time it was sent and received,\u201d she said in July. \u201cWhat I think you\u2019re seeing here is a very typical kind of discussion, to some extent disagreement among various parts of the government, over what should or should not be publicly released.\u201d By handing her server to the Justice Department, Clinton opens her email to renewed investigation, as well as to new questions on the overall security of her account.\n\nPolitically, it\u2019s not hard to see what happens next. Republicans will slam her for skirting the rules and look for ways to make this a long-term vulnerability. \u201cShe cannot be trusted to keep America\u2019s secrets or its citizens safe, and therefore cannot be trusted to be commander in chief,\u201d said Walker in a statement released Wednesday. The Wisconsin governor called her email use \u201ca serious and potentially criminal offense that proves [she] put her own personal convenience ahead of the safety and security of the American people.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t a bad strategy. What\u2019s important about the email story\u2014what makes it so damaging for Clinton\u2014is that it highlights a key weakness (her secrecy and evasiveness), suggests misconduct, and is ongoing. So far, there\u2019s no end to the email saga, just a series of small revelations. Each one prompts a day\u2019s worth of coverage, and each one gives Republicans a chance to emphasize her least appealing qualities. If this were a full-fledged campaign, it might not matter to her standing; when voters are energized, they tend to ignore faults on their side. It\u2019s how Mitt Romney could recover from his comments about the \u201c47 percent\u201d; those were damaging, but not so damaging that Republican-leaning voters would abandon the party.\n\nBut we\u2019re still far from the general election, and that campaign effect\u2014intense partisan loyalty\u2014isn\u2019t on the table. Which makes this story more damaging than it might be next year, when\u2014if the nominee\u2014she\u2019ll be buoyed by Democratic enthusiasm.\n\nSo what does that mean, in the short term? In all likelihood, Clinton\u2019s overall favorability will continue to slide, as voters encounter the same, negative story on a semi-regular basis. Already, a majority of Americans say she\u2019s untrustworthy. That won\u2019t change.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:43:39.436+0000"}

On Tuesday the People's Republic indicated that it would allow markets to play a greater role in determining the country\u2019s exchange rate. By Wednesday the country had apparently completely reversed itself, raising questions about Beijing\u2019s stewardship of the economy at a time of deep uncertainty.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nThe tumultuous 48 hours, which could signal another potentially dangerous blow to the Communist Party\u2019s senior leadership after a summer of economic turmoil, began Tuesday with China devaluing its currency, the yuan, by 1.9 percent, in the biggest single-day drop in 20 years\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nChina has historically maintained strict controls over exchange rates\u2014officials set the rate each morning, and it can only go up or down by 2 percent each day. But under Tuesday\u2019s newly announced policy, China\u2019s central bank said that it would base the rate more closely on trades in international markets.\n\nIt seemed like a win-win: Chinese manufacturers would benefit from a cheaper yuan at a time when the country\u2019s exports are flagging, and the foreign governments and international institutions that have long accused China of currency manipulation would be placated. The move would also further Beijing\u2019s goal of establishing the remnimbi as a global reserve currency, and it was welcomed by the IMF. The U.S. government\u2019s reaction was more tentative\u2014after all, the long-standing U.S. complaint about China\u2019s currency manipulation was that the yuan was too low, which artificially boosted its trade surplus and harmed American manufacturing.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, though, the new \u201cmarket-based\u201d yuan was down an additional 1.6 percent, setting off concerns about the overall health of the Chinese economy in world markets. In offshore markets where the Chinese currency is traded freely, the yuan fell throughout the day. In onshore trades it was getting close the low end of the 2 percent threshold. Then, with about 15 minutes left in the Chinese trading day, the central bank evidently decided that enough was enough. So the country\u2019s economic leadership instructed state-owned banks to sell dollars, reversing the day\u2019s trend and pushing the yuan back up about 1 percent.\n\nIt certainly looks like markets weren\u2019t buying the central bank\u2019s reassurances that exchange rates would remain \u201cbasically stable,\u201d which seems to have forced authorities to intervene to prop it up in direct contradiction to the previous day\u2019s stated intentions.\n\nThe wild couple of days in the currency market compounded the damage already done by July\u2019s stock market crash to the Communist Party and President Xi Jinping\u2019s reputation as competent stewards of the country\u2019s economy. Xi has amassed unprecedented political control and eliminated potential rivals through a massive crackdown on both corruption and political dissent. That might be all fine by Chinese citizens as long as the government continues to provide strong economic growth, but it works less well when the government seems incompetent on economic matters. The \u201cChinese dream\u201d Xi has promised citizens includes not just national greatness but personal well-being.\n\nIn the boom months leading up to the stock market collapse, the state-controlled media had strongly encouraged middle-class Chinese citizens to invest in the market, with one magazine promising a \u201cthirty year golden age.\u201d Ultimately, the fortunes of about 80 million investors evaporated in a matter of days, before the government took drastic steps to stop the carnage.\n\nAn even bigger threat to the country\u2019s growth than the market collapse are falling exports, caused by a combination of lower foreign demand, increased competition from lower-wage labor elsewhere in Asia, and the previous strength of the yuan.\n\nOverseas shipments were down 8.3 percent compared with last year in figures released last weekend, a wake-up call that almost certainly led to this week\u2019s currency moves. But as Slate\u2019s Ali Griswold points out, while exporters would benefit from a lower yuan, it if were to fall too much, that would be bad news for Chinese companies that have to pay interest on their debts in foreign currencies. This could also be bad news for the small and medium-size companies, crucial to China\u2019s continued growth, who already took a hit this summer from the market crash.\n\nChina\u2019s policymakers have looked much more panicky and uncertain this summer than they normally do.

Joe Biden, who is still teasing another White House run, comes in third place with 9 percent. Meanwhile, no one in the rest of the declared Democratic field\u2014Martin O\u2019Malley, Jim Webb, and Lincoln Chafee\u2014garnered more than 1 percent support.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSanders\u2019 lead is his first in a New Hampshire poll this year, though his 7-point advantage is narrowly within the poll\u2019s margin of error\u2014the third major survey in a row that found no statistically significant difference in support between the self-styled democratic socialist and the Democratic establishment favorite. These polls, then, tell us little about who\u2019s currently up in New Hampshire\u2014but plenty about how tight of a race it has become there. Three months ago Clinton led Sanders by an average of nearly 50 points in the state. After the latest poll, Hillary\u2019s lead now stands at 3.2 points, according to RealClearPolitics\u2019 rolling state average.\n\nAs a popular senator from neighboring Vermont, Sanders has the advantage of playing on quasi\u2013home field in New Hampshire. If he was ever going to mount a strong early challenge to Hillary, the Granite State was always going to the place. Still, Bernie-mania isn\u2019t confined to New England. Sanders is proving to be the biggest draw on the campaign trail this summer by far. According to the Washington Post\u2019s unofficial tally, he\u2019s drawn estimated crowds of 11,000 in Phoenix, 15,000 in Seattle, and more than 27,000 in both Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles in recent weeks. Those Portland and L.A. crowds are roughly five times the number that have shown up for any single Clinton event this year. (Sanders is choosing larger venues than Clinton, but in many cases he\u2019s filling them to capacity and beyond.) Bernie\u2019s remarkable drawing power has yet to translate into a major bump in national polls, but it should result in a significant boost to his small-donation\u2013centric fundraising.\n\nThis enthusiasm gap can also be seen in the new New Hampshire poll. Only 35 percent of respondents said they were excited about Clinton, as opposed to 44 percent who said the same thing about Sanders. A big reason for that 10-point difference appears to be what voters are hearing from the candidates on the stump: Nearly 7 in 10 Bernie supporters said their chief reason for backing him was because they agreed with him on the issues; fewer than 3 in 10 said the same thing about Hillary.\n\nStill, Clinton\u2019s camp can take solace in the fact that New Hampshire Democrats might not love her, but she\u2019s likeable enough. Eighty percent of respondents in the FPU poll said they had a \u201cfavorable\u201d view of her. Meanwhile, of the 56 percent of Democrats who said they weren\u2019t excited about her candidacy, more than half said they could still see themselves supporting her anyway. For Clinton, that\u2019s probably enough to continue on the same safe path she\u2019s been on\u2014particularly when you factor in her massive advantages in fundraising, endorsements, and campaign infrastructure.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:44:05.956+0000"}

Medicaid patients can use Planned Parenthood to obtain contraception, STI treatment, and well-woman screenings, but they have to pay for abortion out of pocket. Title X funding is used solely by Planned Parenthood to subsidize the cost of contraception and doctor visits for uninsured patients.\n\nTrump is, in other words, right. Not about much, but definitely about this. So much so that Planned Parenthood spokesman Eric Ferrero told the Daily Beast, \"Donald Trump seems to have realized that banning all abortions, shutting down the government, and defunding Planned Parenthood are extreme positions that are way too far outside the mainstream for even him to take.\"\n\nLila Rose, whose group Live Action helped publicize the videos accusing Planned Parenthood of selling fetal tissue, released a response statement saying Planned Parenthood is an \"abortion conglomerate that is totally unnecessary.\" John Nolte at Breitbart argued that Planned Parenthood's policy of offering subsidized contraception but charging full price for abortions is \"a shell game to skirt the laws that make it illegal for federal taxpayer money to fund abortions.\" Daniel Davis at Town Hall echoed this, arguing, \"Each federal dollar that goes to Planned Parenthood indirectly supports and perpetuates the abortion industry.\"\n\nIt's not true. If you want an abortion at Planned Parenthood, you pay the cost yourself, either out of pocket or by billing a private insurance company.

{"entityId": 229, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "There was another fallacy in Bush\u2019s description of the surge: Though it was a huge tactical success, it did not pave the way toward \u201cvictory.\u201d As its architect, Gen. David Petraeus, said on several occasions, the surge was meant merely to create some \u201cbreathing space,\u201d a \u201czone of security,\u201d so that Iraq\u2019s political factions could form a unified government. The problem was that Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki didn\u2019t want unity: He didn\u2019t want to make a deal on power-sharing, oil revenues, or land settlements with Sunni or Kurdish leaders; he wanted to maintain Shiite dominance\u2014and it was Maliki\u2019s stubbornness that revived the sectarian violence and left a lane open for ISIS, whose leaders exploited their fellow Sunnis\u2019 resentments.\n\nGranted, President Obama did want to get out of Iraq; he won the White House in large part on that promise, and there was no more support in the United States than in Iraq for a continued presence of American troops. And yet Obama did send emissaries\u2014among them former aides to George W. Bush\u2014to seek an amendment to allow a few thousand residual forces. The Iraqi government refused. Unless Obama wanted to re-invade the country, there was nothing to be done.\n\nArticle 30 of that same agreement stated that its terms could be amended \u201conly with the official agreement of the Parties in writing and in accordance with the constitutional procedures in effect in both countries.\u201d These \u201cconstitutional procedures\u201d included a vote by the Iraqi Parliament\u2014and at no time between 2008 and 2011 was the Iraqi Parliament going to take such a vote.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d he asked, \u201cwas the success of the surge followed by a withdrawal from Iraq?\u201d The \u201cfatal error,\u201d he answered, was the \u201cpremature withdrawal\u201d ordered by President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who \u201cstood by\u201d as our \u201chard-won victory\u201d was \u201cthrown away\u201d in \u201ca blind haste to get out\u201d\u2014leaving a vacuum that Iran and ISIS filled.\n\nThe history\u2014his effort to hide the scar of his own family history\u2014was where he placed most of his chips, and he lost them all. As a preface, he admitted that \u201cno leader or policymaker\u201d got \u201ceverything right\u201d in the Middle East, \u201cIraq especially\u201d (his single indirect acknowledgment of his brother\u2019s mistakes). But, he added, \u201cone moment stands out in memory as the turning point\u201d of the war in that country\u2014namely, the \u201csurge,\u201d which \u201cturned events toward victory.\u201d\n\nLater in Tuesday night\u2019s speech, Bush said that the Iraq surge can serve as a model for how \u201cIslamic moderates can be pulled away from extremist forces\u201d in Syria. I doubt that he was proposing to send 100,000 U.S. troops to Syria, as his brother did in Iraq\u2014an idea that would appeal to almost no American generals or voters. But what he was proposing isn\u2019t at all clear.\n\nBush also decried Obama\u2019s \u201climited strikes and other half-measures\u201d against ISIS forces in Iraq and Syria. But does this mean that he\u2019s proposing all-out strikes and full measures? As president, he said, he would \u201ctake the offensive\u201d and \u201cprevail\u201d against radical Islam. He would embed the current U.S. advisers in Iraq alongside local forces\u2014though here, he added, \u201cWe do not need, and our friends do not ask for, a major commitment of American combat forces.\u201d Isn\u2019t this some sort of \u201chalf-measure\u201d? Or might embedding troops (essentially turning the advisers into combat forces) escalate our involvement to a full measure, \u201ca major commitment\u201d\u2014the sort of slippery slope that Obama is taking care to avoid, rightly or wrongly. And would Bush escalate the fight if mere embedding didn\u2019t do the job? He didn\u2019t say.\n\nHe did say, \u201cIn all of this,\u201d referring to the fight against jihadists, \u201cthe United States must engage with friends and allies, and lead again in that vital region.\u201d Which friends and allies does he mean? The Saudis try to rope us into a savage, fruitless war against the Houthi rebels, whom it portrays as Iranian proxies. The Turks lend us an air base to step up strikes against ISIS but then use the moment of goodwill as cover to attack their bigger enemy, the Kurds, who rank as the jihadists\u2019 most potent foe (and to whom Bush promised in his speech to send heavy armaments). ISIS derives much of its strength from the deep disunity of its natural foes, some of whom are our allies, some of whom aren\u2019t. \u201cAction, coordination and American leadership,\u201d the solutions Bush calls for, are more complex than he\u2014and many other Republicans who have never held national office\u2014seems to recognize.\n\nHe criticized Obama for drawing a \u201cred line\u201d against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s use of chemical weapons, then failing to follow through. Many of Obama\u2019s defenders have filed the same complaint. But what would Bush do? \u201cUnder my strategy,\u201d he said, \u201cthe aim would be to draw the [Syrian] moderates together and back them up as one force \u2026 not just in taking the fight to the enemy but in helping them to form a stable moderate government once ISIS is defeated and Assad is gone.\u201d How would he do this? By replicating his brother\u2019s surge in Iraq. After all, he added with blithe confidence, \u201cthe strategic elements in both cases [Iraq circa 2007 and Syria today] are the same\u201d\u2014thus demonstrating that he and his speechwriters have no understanding of the tangled politics in Syria or of what made the Iraqi surge work to the extent that it did.\n\nAs a first step to boosting American influence, Bush said he would reverse the \u201csignificant dismantling of our own military\u201d of the past seven years, ignoring that defense spending has been on the rise and that the current budget, amounting to $620 billion, is larger than at any time since the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. One could argue for some sort of rejiggering in defense spending, but Bush didn\u2019t do that.\n\nFinally, Bush made a strong showing in the competition to see which Republican candidate can most pummel Obama\u2019s nuclear deal with Iran. Like the others, he promised to undo the deal \u201cimmediately\u201d upon taking office\u2014ignoring that five other nations also signed the deal and are unlikely to follow such a lead. He mischaracterized the accord in a number of ways. He lambasted \u201cthe Obama-Clinton-Kerry policy of treating the mullahs in Iran as a stabilizing force\u201d (there is no such policy), complained that the deal says nothing about Iran\u2019s support for terrorism (true, but a generation of Soviet-American arms-control treaties, including some signed by the hero of this speech, Ronald Reagan, said nothing about the ravages of Communism), and scoffed that \u201cleast of all does it prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capability\u201d (when, in fact, it does and, despite another common claim, for more than 10 years).\n\nThroughout the speech, Bush spoke of restoring trust in American leadership. But what he proposed doing in his first days as president\u2014scuttling a deal that the nation\u2019s top diplomats and scientists negotiated alongside five great powers of Europe and Asia, and that the U.N. Security Council then unanimously endorsed\u2014would shatter that trust and diminish that leadership.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:44:26.931+0000"}

Investors were hoping for some good news that might help Alibaba reverse a slide in its stock price that\u2019s lasted for more than two months. But alas. While Alibaba narrowly beat expectations on earnings (with adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 versus an expected $0.58), revenue was light and a few key metrics showed that the company\u2019s once-insane growth is starting to slow. Shares tumbled more than 7 percent after the morning bell.\n\nLet\u2019s look at two of those important company metrics. Most of Alibaba\u2019s revenue comes from what sales merchants make on its online shopping platforms, which include consumer-to-consumer destination Taobao and merchant-to-consumer site Tmall. Alibaba takes commissions and fees on these transactions. To measure the health of its e-commerce marketplaces, Alibaba looks at two main things: annual active buyers and gross merchandise volume (basically, the total value of stuff sold over a certain period of time). In the lead-up to its September 2014 initial public offering, Alibaba\u2019s year-over-year growth in both of those categories kept going up. But lately\u2014and especially in the most recent quarter\u2014those growth figures have dropped off. You can see that in the two charts below:\n\n\n\nData from Alibaba. Chart by Alison Griswold.\n\n\n\nData from Alibaba. Chart by Alison Griswold.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s causing this deceleration? At the macro-level, Alibaba is struggling to perform in a lagging Chinese economy. China has recently released a string of weak economic numbers and could likely miss its stated annual growth target of 7 percent. On Wednesday, the People\u2019s Bank of China also devalued the yuan for the second consecutive day, pushing shares lower globally on fears that the nation\u2019s economy is doing worse than had been widely acknowledged. Alibaba has been caught in this economic turbulence. Its stock has fallen about 17 percent since late May and is off about 35 percent from the highs it reached in November 2014, shortly after IPOing.\n\nMore particular to Alibaba, the company is attempting to combat a slowdown in the growth rate of Chinese Internet users, as well as ongoing concerns about the authenticity of goods sold on its platform. In late June, Alibaba announced a joint venture with online payments service Ant Financial for \u201ccapturing opportunities within China\u2019s local services market.\u201d And earlier this week, Alibaba said it was investing $4.63 billion for a 20 percent stake in Suning, a major Chinese consumer electronics retailer, in an effort to further integrate \u201cdigital and offline retail.\u201d Under the deal, Suning will open a store on Alibaba\u2019s Tmall marketplace, and Alibaba will gain access to Suning\u2019s extensive delivery and logistics network.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:44:29.407+0000"}

Likewise, in the weekend after the debate, Trump took further fire from Republican politicians and conservative activists. On Friday, Erick Erickson\u2014editor in chief of RedState\u2014lobbed a trident at Trump and ejected him from the site\u2019s annual conference, citing his sexist attack on Kelly. \u201cYou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever,\u201d Trump had said in an interview Friday on CNN. (Erickson has his own history of misogynist rhetoric.) Bush called on Trump to apologize, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry slammed Trump for a \u201cserious lack of character and basic decency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe great irony of this is that, as Trump is someone who draws from the most anti-establishment parts of the Republican Party, these attacks could help Trump as much as hurt him. To that point, there\u2019s no evidence he\u2019s paid a price with Republican voters since the debate, and small signs he\u2019s just as popular as he was before. In a post-debate online survey from NBC News, 23 percent of Republicans endorsed Trump. Jeb Bush, the modest front-runner in cash, organization, and endorsements, won just 7 percent support. And looking among Republicans in Iowa, Public Policy Polling found Trump with a solid lead of 19 percent, to 12 percent for Ben Carson and Gov. Scott Walker, and 11 percent for Jeb Bush. Conservative and Republican leaders are worried: The higher Trump\u2019s star, the more damage he might do to the GOP\u2019s presidential hopes.\n\n\u201cWe will not gain the White House,\u201d said Erickson about Trump and his supporters, \u201cif we\u2019re screaming at people, calling them whores and queer and the N-word.\u201d In the same vein, the New York Times reports that \u201cprominent Republican women said they were worried about how female voters would respond to Mr. Trump\u2019s prominence on the debate stage, where he defended imprecations like \u2018fat pigs\u2019 and \u2018bimbo\u2019 to describe women\u2014and his rivals did not chide him.\u201d Trump is a toxic figure, and Republicans are right to do everything they can to push him out of the race.\n\nThe most important variable for the election\u2014and for Republicans in particular\u2014is the economy.\n\nAt the same time, Republicans shouldn\u2019t worry too much about Trump\u2019s effect on their presidential prospects. Yes, there are real dangers to Trump-mentum: The longer Trump stays in the game, the greater odds that voters will associate him with the Republican Party itself. In general, that\u2019s a problem. When it comes to the specific case of Latino voters\u2014an important part of any Republican election plan\u2014it\u2019s dangerous. Trump could become the \u201cself-deportation\u201d of the 2016 race: a concrete symbol of anti-immigrant and anti-Latino animus. And of course there\u2019s the real (if small) risk that Trump holds his support, makes a third-party run, and dooms Republican White House ambitions.\n\nWe can\u2019t predict if Trump will run for president as an independent, and it\u2019s difficult to say how he\u2019ll influence broad perceptions of the Republican Party. But if the 2012 election taught us anything, it\u2019s that the shenanigans of the primary don\u2019t necessarily influence the general election.\n\nConventional wisdom notwithstanding, Mitt Romney wasn\u2019t harmed by the extremism that blossomed through 2011, and into the first voting primaries. If anything, in fact, the opposite happened. As Lynn Vavreck and John Sides note in The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election, \u201ccompared to Obama, Romney was ideologically closer to more voters all along.\u201d By the end of the 2012 campaign, according to research from YouGov, \u201c52 percent of voters placed themselves closer to Romney than Obama, while 38 percent placed themselves closer to Obama.\u201d\n\nHow did voters miss that Romney was a self-proclaimed \u201cseverely conservative\u201d governor? They didn\u2019t see it in the first place. From this point in the process until the conventions, the only people paying real attention are political diehards and otherwise informed people. But the most politically informed Americans are also the most partisan ones, with firm positions and clear allegiances to one party or the other. Twenty-four million people may have watched last Thursday\u2019s debate, but there\u2019s a strong chance those viewers had already made up their minds: They were either Republicans interested in the process, or Democrats with a taste for schadenfreude.\n\nIf most voters don\u2019t pay attention until late in the process, and if those who do aren\u2019t up for grabs, then how do we explain Romney\u2019s apparent weakness in 2012?

Hillary Clinton is too. The overwhelming favorite for the Democratic nomination has spent months trying to convince liberals that she\u2019s a fighter. Thanks to Trump, she\u2019s finally getting to act like one on the campaign trail.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in New Hampshire on Monday, Clinton blasted Trump for making his controversial (and arguably menstruation-themed) remarks about Fox News\u2019 Megyn Kelly after last week\u2019s debate. Hillary, though, didn\u2019t just take the political gimme that Trump\u2019s comments provided and move on; she made sure to hit the entire Republican field in the process.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThey brag about slashing women\u2019s health-care funding,\u201d Clinton said of her GOP rivals. \u201cThey say they would force women who\u2019ve been raped to carry their rapist\u2019s child. You don\u2019t hear any of them supporting raising the minimum wage, paid leave for new parents, access to quality child care, equal pay for women, or anything that will help to give women a chance to get ahead.\u201d\n\nThis is the opportunity that The Donald offers Hillary\u2014and the danger his surprising durability represents to the eventual Republican nominee. It\u2019s easy for someone like Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, or Marco Rubio to play the role of grown-up alongside Trump\u2019s petulant child on the debate stage. It\u2019s quite another thing when Clinton can point out that several of their underlying policy positions are even more extreme than the tough-talking reality TV star\u2019s. Hillary\u2019s smart to recognize that, and to seize on it.\n\nClinton was always going to have the advantage with female voters in 2016, but the odd combo of Trump\u2019s incendiary remarks and (relatively!) moderate positions tilts the playing field even further to her advantage. Consider: The GOP\u2019s Big Three all want to defund Planned Parenthood. Trump, though, says he\u2019s open to preserving some of the organization\u2019s federal funding. Rubio and Walker have made it clear they want to outlaw abortions even in the cases of rape or when the mother\u2019s life is at risk. Trump, though, supports such exceptions. If you strip away Trump\u2019s misogynistic comments, then, and compare him only to his GOP rivals, his Trumpian claim that he\u2019d \u201cbe able to do things for women that no other candidate would be able to do\u201d doesn\u2019t sound so ridiculous.\n\nThat's a very real problem for a party that is desperate to avoid the same war-on-women narrative that hurt it in 2012. Republicans will need to find a way to limit Clinton\u2019s obvious advantages with women in the general election\u2014but that becomes an even more difficult task if she has already convinced voters that the eventual GOP nominee\u2019s views are actually to the right of a man who calls women \u201cslobs\u201d and \u201cdisgusting animals.\u201d If the belligerent billionaire represents the conservative fringe\u2014and for many Americans, he does\u2014then what does that say about those establishment candidates who are even further from the center than he is?

It\u2019s also a smart move, because when it comes to what the U.S. could have done to prevent the disaster in Iraq and Syria, it\u2019s going to be hard for Clinton to defend her record without criticizing her former boss\u2014something Clinton won\u2019t want to do during the Democratic primary, one would imagine.\n\nWithin the Obama administration, Clinton was an early and enthusiastic advocate for aiding the rebellion against Bashar al-Assad, at one point working with then-CIA Director David Petraeus to draft a plan for arming the rebels that Obama rejected. The position was close to what Sen. John McCain and presidential candidate Lindsey Graham were arguing for at the time, and McCain has subsequently criticized the president for rejecting it.\n\nClinton was on the hawkish side of most internal Obama administration foreign policy debates, siding frequently with former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who has been scathing in his assessment of the president\u2019s decision-making. Her side won out in the decision to intervene in Libya to topple Muammar al-Qaddafi (for better or worse) and lost out on Syria (for better or worse).\n\nIn an interview with the Atlantic\u2019s Jeffery Goldberg last year, Clinton blamed the failure to help the rebels early in the civil war for the rise of ISIS and the worsening of a crisis that eventually spread to Iraq, saying, \u201cThe failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad\u2014there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle\u2014the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.\u201d In the same interview, she criticized the foreign policy mantra attributed to Obama that goes \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid stuff\u201d or \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid shit,\u201d depending on the publication it\u2019s being printed in. \u201cGreat nations need organizing principles, and \u2018Don\u2019t do stupid stuff\u2019 is not an organizing principle,\u201d she said.\n\nBut since the campaign season kicked off, Clinton has avoided criticizing the administration on foreign policy. As we get closer to the general election and Republicans continue to associate her with a policy they say is characterized by weakness and appeasement, it\u2019s going to get harder for Clinton to present her actually fairly hawkish views without drawing a contrast between Obama\u2019s foreign policy and what she would have done in his place.

{"entityId": 239, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo byPaul McKinnon/Shutterstock.com\n\nThe already confused and conflicted world of gay Christianity has become a little more confused and conflicted lately. In July, Kevin Kanouse, an Evangelical Lutheran bishop, came out as gay, sharing personal feelings about growing up in a conservative social climate and voicing his respect for married same-sex couples\u2014along with his personal determination to remain married to his wife. Bill Dickinson, a gay former Catholic priest, wrote about ways in which the Catholic Church could change its approach to LGBTQ people without reforming the church\u2019s doctrine on sexuality. And earlier in the month, Julie Rodgers, a blogger in the \u201cSide B\u201d celibate Christian community, wrote of her evolution toward support for same-sex couples and resigned her position as a spiritual counselor at evangelical-affiliated Wheaton College in Illinois.\n\nDiscussions of these three brave statements on social media and in the LGBTQ blogosphere have tended to focus on the criticisms these three individuals made of their respective religious communities. But in addition to calling for change in conservative groups, each of the three underscored the values they still share with those communities, along with their hope that gays and lesbians could be welcomed into them. They did not reject those communities wholesale or say anything to suggest they\u2019d joined the liberal consensus on sexual ethics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to sexual matters, our country divides into those with a liberal sexual ethic and those with a conservative one (this sometimes, but not always, matches the political division between Democrats and Republicans). Those of us with a liberal sexual ethic place a high value on consent, freedom, and individual expression in sexual matters. Conservatives, on the other hand, emphasize stability, tradition, and obedience to authority instead. When those conservative views on sex are codified into law, it will inevitably lead to repression and punishment for those who do not share conservative sexual values. Liberal values, however, are completely consistent with allowing some individuals to choose stability, tradition, and obedience over personal expression. While we can\u2019t, and shouldn\u2019t, expect the queer community and its allies to practice tolerance toward the bigots and haters who would stop at nothing to bring us down, there\u2019s nothing incompatible with the liberal stance if some individuals freely choose to follow religious teachings about sex and/or to abstain from sex outside of a lifelong romantic commitment.\n\nIf gay sexuality isn\u2019t fundamentally different from straight sexuality\u2014if the only difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals is the object of their attentions\u2014then a conservative sexual ethic is no less compatible with being gay than it is with being straight. In the relatively brief history of the gay rights movement, we\u2019ve seen the social stigma against gays and lesbians virtually eradicated in the most liberal, sexually awakened parts of the country. In more conservative areas, the gains have been slower, but the trends are clearly pointing toward increasing acceptance and integration of gays and lesbians throughout the country.\n\nIf this trend continues, trailblazers like Kanouse, Rodgers, and Dickinson are just the tip of the iceberg. As tolerance pushes outward from its old borders and into parts of the country where a more conservative, churchgoing culture persists, gays and lesbians who grew up in these areas will have less reason to remain in the closet, and young people raised in those cultures will feel less pressure to escape to more liberal climes. As this happens, we can\u2019t expect them to conform to the liberal, sexually progressive model we\u2019ve come to expect of members of the LGBTQ community. Instead, they\u2019ll experiment with new ways of being gay, and of integrating a homosexual orientation into rich, full lives without losing their connection to the value systems they were brought up with. Whether the liberal LGBTQ community is flexible enough to accommodate new ways of being gay is a test of our liberal principles, and one with implications beyond a handful of celibate Christians and members of the clergy.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:45:51.300+0000"}

Trump, who took offense to some of Kelly\u2019s questions during Thursday night\u2019s Republican presidential candidate debate, told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Friday that \u201cyou could see there was blood coming out of her eyes.

Yes, Trump is leading the polls right now. But it is the middle of the summer in 2015, and leading the polls right now means very little. In 2011, Herman Cain was for a time the GOP presidential front-runner. In 1996, Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan were early favorites. Blusterers and businessmen tend to do well early on in presidential campaigns, but they inevitably lose their luster. In reference to Trump, \u201cLet\u2019s get back to the news\u201d ought to mean recalibrating the network\u2019s campaign coverage to focus on issues and substance.\n\nAnd indeed, Kelly may wish to move on from any coverage of Trump entirely.

Conversely, any Republican front-runner who feuds with Fox News risks losing that front-runner status quickly, which is why it makes sense for Trump to make peace with Fox.

{"entityId": 243, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nThere is a long and complicated list of reasons why Washington has failed to make higher education more affordable over the years. But in some ways, the issue boils down to a single, obvious problem. The federal government can give students money to pay for school, but it can't control what colleges charge. And no matter how much more aid it has handed out to families, the price of tuition has risen faster.\n\nJordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.\n\nWhy has tuition rocketed up? While I'm sure you'd love a 10-day explanation, here's the short version, as it applies to public colleges. First, schools are spending more than they used to running themselves. (For that, we can thank everything from luxurious lazy rivers on campus to the growing size of college administrations). Second, states are spending less than they used to subsidizing students. (For that, we can partly thank budget cuts that followed the recession, though disinvestment in higher education has been a long-running problem).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOver the past several months, Democrats seem to have coalesced around one big idea that could fix this fundamental dysfunction. It's a three-part bargain that goes roughly like this:\n\n\n\nPart 1: The federal government should give money directly to states so they can refund their colleges and universities.\n\nPart 2: The states need to quit their budget-slashing ways, and likely increase their funding for higher ed, much the same way that they cover a minimum amount of Medicaid spending.\n\nPart 3: In order to qualify for the new wad of federal cash, colleges will need to keep their prices down.\n\nThis, more or less, was the basic outline of President Obama's plan for free community college, which he unveiled right before the State of the Union. It's also the core of presidential candidate Bernie Sanders' plan to eliminate tuition at all public colleges. And now, it's the centerpiece of Hillary Clinton's big new proposal to to bring down the cost of higher education, which she unveiled Monday.\n\nWhile perhaps not quite as ambitious as Sanders' concept, Clinton's version is part of a sweeping, 10-year, $350 billion agenda designed to guarantee that students can attend a four-year public school without taking out loans for their tuition, or graduate from a two-year community college without paying tuition at all. That's not the same as saying students would graduate debt-free, since many undergrads borrow heavily to cover living expenses. Meanwhile, families of bachelor's degree seekers would still be expected to pay a reasonable amount toward their children's education while students would need to work 10 hours a week to make the math work. But it would still be a large step forward from where we are today. As of now, the Department of Education says that public colleges and universities currently take in around $65 billion worth of tuition and fees each year. Clinton would spend about $175 billion over a decade on grants to states\u2014not nearly enough to eliminate the burden on students, but, combined with the other pieces of her program, enough to alleviate it.\n\n\n\nClinton's plan is studded with other proposals that, on their own, are smart, ambitious, and in some cases controversial. To discourage schools from loading students with too much debt, for instance, she would fine institutions whose graduates can't pay back their loans, a currently bipartisan idea known as \"skin-in-the-game\" that would make much of the higher-ed world howl in protest. She would further crack down on the for-profit education industry, which has many friends in Congress. She would massively simplify the Department of Education's income-based repayment programs, which cap what student debtors have to pay each month as a percentage of their paycheck and forgive the balance after a period of time, and make the new version open to all borrowers. And taking a page from Elizabeth Warren, Clinton would also look to lower student loan interest rates and let borrowers with older debt refinance.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:46:05.389+0000"}

Several minutes later, he declared that Chris Wallace seemed to have \u201cblood pouring out of his eyes\u201d while interrogating him, too. It is no secret that Trump is a cartoonish misogynist. But the media frenzy over bloodgate also seemed to be missing some key context.\n\nTrump\u2019s Kelly comments were a sliver of a 30-minutes\u2013long interview that rambled from his feelings on immigration, to the Republican National Committee, to the virtues of Matt Drudge. Overall, the interview was more than anything an extended boast about Trump\u2019s own magnetism. He interrupted his Kelly diatribe to praise his own part in the Fox News debate\u2019s massive viewership (\u201cThey call me the ratings machine\u201d), and the success of The Apprentice. When he finally returned to Kelly, it was with a specific eye toward her perch in the cultural marketplace: \u201cI just don\u2019t respect her as a journalist. I have no respect for her. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s very good. I think she\u2019s highly overrated.\u201d\n\nOverrated is one of Trump\u2019s favorite insults. He has used it to burn many other public figures, from Charles Krauthammer to Bill Cosby. This makes sense, because the most notable feature of his worldview may be less his egomania or his general indecency than the way he regards the whole public sphere through the lens of ratings\u2014it\u2019s a realm of showmen and slobs, winners and losers, somebodies and nobodies. To Trump, all forms of renown are undifferentiated, all eyeballs equally desirable, whether directed toward a reality show or a presidential campaign. So overrated is the perfect encapsulation of his swaggering \u201cus vs. them\u201d mentality, his sense of his own impresario\u2019s role in the culture. That, more than anything, was what seemed to be driving his loopy comments about Kelly. This is a man whose politics are exclusively personal, untainted by a single higher ideal. His Don Lemon interview was, as usual, a carnival of ad hominem jabs. \u201cThe dour George Will,\u201d he said, \u201cnever has anything good to say about me, and I can tell you why: Something happened 12 years ago where I did a number on him. At least there I understand it.\u201d That same day, he tweeted: \u201c\u202a@FrankLuntz is a low class slob who came to my office looking for consulting work and I had zero interest,\u201d after Luntz criticized him on the air. The brutal outlook that has fueled his whole campaign, the way he seems to assess the whole public arena as a field of prospects to hire or fire, is the same one that made The Apprentice such a hit.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:46:07.661+0000"}

{"entityId": 249, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Stephane Mahe/Reuters\n\nThe introduction of same-sex marriage in May 2013 was, without a doubt, the most important LGBTQ rights victory in France since the decriminalization of homosexuality in 1982.\n\nIn the year the law was adopted, beginning with the first ceremony at the H\u00f4tel de Ville in the Mediterranean city of Montpellier on May 29, 7,367 same-sex marriages were registered in France. (That same year, an additional 6,000 gay couples entered into a pacte civil de solidarit\u00e9, or PACS, a contractual form of civil partnership that has been available to couples, regardless of gender, since 1999.) In 2014, 10,000 new marriages were registered, giving new life to an institution that has been in decline over the last decade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSame-sex marriage has made gay people feel \u201cless outcast,\u201d Anthony Roux, vice president of SOS Homophobie, a group that records and reports homophobic and transphobic discrimination and violence and provides support to victims, told me. \u201cThey feel more included in society. This is a good thing for everyone in France, LGBT or not. It\u2019s a law that will have a very good impact on the lives of LGBT people in the long run.\u201d\n\nBut this major victory had unforeseen consequences. The almighty resistance to the idea of same-sex marriage, with La Manif Pour Tous (a collective of groups opposed to same-sex marriage and adoption) organizing demonstrations that brought hundreds of thousands of people out onto the streets of Paris, took the wind out of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s presidency within its first year and halted the momentum behind the LGBTQ rights movement.\n\nBeyond marriage, Roux explained that the issues of vital importance right now are: access to artificial insemination for lesbian couples; making it easier for trans people to change their gender for legal purposes and removing the requirement that they undergo sterilization before their preferred gender identity is recognized; and removing the indefinite ban on blood donation for men who have had sex with men. With Hollande\u2019s popularity at a record low and all his political capital spent, however, no progress on these matters can be expected anytime soon.\n\nThe opponents of LGBTQ rights \u201cwill never be as visible as they were during the same-sex marriage controversy,\u201d Roux says, but they did enable the comeback of former President Nicolas Sarkozy, who won the leadership of the opposition Les R\u00e9publicains party in part because of his defense of the \u201ctraditional\u201d family. Same-sex marriage is \u201chumiliating families and humiliating people who love the family,\u201d the thrice-married Sarkozy said in September 2014; in November he announced that he would repeal the Taubira law, as the marriage equality legislation is known in France, if he is elected again in 2017.\n\nMarriage equality has also hastened the pace at which gay and lesbian people are assimilating into wider French society. There wasn\u2019t much of a culture of queer distinctiveness to begin with, at least not in the way it is understood in the United States. In France, communaut\u00e9s (communities) and political lobbies are considered anti-French and contrary to the workings of an egalitarian republic, while the notion of being queer or fluid isn\u2019t very well developed. The French attitude to sex and relationships as private matters also comes into play.\n\nBut Paul Parant, web editor at the French gay magazine T\u00eatu, believes that the struggle to make marriage equality happen\u2014a fight that was \u201creally ugly, really painful, really long\u201d and above all unexpected\u2014caused French LGBTQ people to quickly depoliticize and retreat. Most hurtful were those accusations of communautarisme (communitarianism), the idea that gay marriage represented a special interest and not an attempt by LGBTQ people to enjoy the same rights as everyone else.\n\n\u201cThere is a sense that you cannot be completely French if you belong to a community,\u201d Parant told me. \u201cIn America, community is a positive word, but for the French, it\u2019s somewhat scary.\u201d\n\nAssimilation is also evident in the curious relationship between gays and the Front National, Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party. Once considered taboo, a recent poll suggests that support for the FN is now higher in Paris among homosexual and bisexual voters than among heterosexuals. The party\u2019s higher echelons are lousy with gays. Florian Philippot, FN\u2019s vice president, was outed by the tabloid magazine Closer late last year, around the same time that Le Pen appointed S\u00e9bastien Chenu, founder of the LGBTQ rights organization GayLib, to be her \u201ccultural adviser.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarine Le Pen promises a clear change and everyone wants a clear change\u2014it\u2019s bullshit of course,\u201d Parant says, noting that the FN is currently the only political movement with any momentum. Le Pen has redefined her party as the last defender of republicanism and French nationalism, attractive to those seeking to dodge the charge of communautarisme. Le Pen has also been successful in drawing a connection between Arab and Muslim immigration and the security of other minorities, specifically Jews and gays.\n\n\u201cShe said it once, only once, but everyone kept repeating it, that she would defend Jews and gays against the Arabs. But it worked, it just worked. People are buying into it,\u201d Parant said.\n\nI sat down with Parant in T\u00eatu\u2019s office in central Paris two days before the magazine was put into liquidation by the courts, having filed for bankruptcy in March and failed to find new investors. Pierre Berg\u00e9\u2014Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s life partner\u2014who spent handsomely on the magazine\u2019s high-quality art and fashion layouts and its nationwide advertising campaigns, founded T\u00eatu in 1995. The magazine became widely known and helped to boost LGBTQ visibility, but it never made money. In 2013, Berg\u00e9 sold T\u00eatu to publisher Jean-Jacques Augier, whose pockets weren\u2019t deep enough to save a magazine that lost around 1 million euros in 2014. T\u00eatu, in Parant\u2019s view, is another casualty of assimilation.\n\nThe Russian revolutionary writer Alexander Herzen once observed that at the death of contemporary forms of social order, the departing world leaves behind not an heir, but a pregnant widow. \u201cBetween the death of the one and the birth of the other, much water will flow by, a long night of chaos and desolation will pass.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:46:58.853+0000"}

(The debate over Hart-Celler was taking place before most of the South\u2019s racially conservative Democrats defected to the Republican Party \u2014Thurmond himself had just switched a year before.) To win the support of Ervin and Illinois\u2019 Everett Dirksen, another key conservative vote, the Johnson administration agreed to a basic annual cap of 120,000 on total Western Hemisphere immigrants . The bill soon passed the Senate 76\u201318 . In 1976 a further restriction was enacted that limited each Western Hemisphere country to basic caps of 20,000. The country most affected by the new Western Hemisphere rules: Mexico.\n\nBut some conservative senators were skeptical about altering the \u201cnational origins\u201d system. They argued, as South Carolina Republican Strom Thurmond did, that the imperative \u201cto preserve one\u2019s identity and the identity of one\u2019s nation\u201d justified restrictionist policies that favored Western Europeans because they could more easily assimilate into the existing (white) culture. These opponents furthermore added that uncapped Western Hemisphere immigration was itself a looming threat to the United States\u2019 identity and stability. \u201cThe day is not far off when the population explosion in Latin American countries will exert great pressures upon those people to emigrate to the United States,\u201d said West Virginia Democrat Robert Byrd.\n\nIn 1965, President Johnson backed a reform proposal called the Hart-Celler Act (aka the Immigration and Nationality Act), which proposed to eradicate the \u201cnational origins\u201d immigration quotas that had been in place since the 1920s. Those quotas prohibited vast non-white portions of the world population (e.g. almost all Africans and Asians) from immigrating to the U.S. while restricting the number of visas allotted to European countries, like Italy and Poland, whose natives were considered ethnically inferior to those from England, Scandinavia, and the like. Under the new system proposed by Hart-Celler, every country outside the Western Hemisphere would have the same basic quota of 20,000 visas. Legal immigration from the Western Hemisphere (i.e., North, Central, and South America) was to remain uncapped\u2014as it had always been, even during the height of the 1920s anti-immigration movement, out of diplomatic respect for our nearby neighbors and because a treaty related to the military takeover of the Southwest had already declared that ex-Mexicans were eligible for citizenship.\n\nAs Fox News debate moderators reminded America last week, Donald Trump believes that \u201c the Mexican government is forcing their most unwanted people \u201d\u2014including drug dealers and rapists, who are \u201c doing the raping \u201d\u2014into the United States as illegal immigrants. Trump nonetheless wants to make clear that he has no problem with legal immigration. \u201cMany fabulous people come in from Mexico and our country is better for it,\u201d Trump wrote in a July statement. \u201cBut these people are here legally, and are severely hurt by those coming in illegally.\u201d Almost all conservative politicians who believe illegal immigration is a problem make the same distinction: Ted Cruz\u2019s website, for example, says the senator \u201c celebrates legal immigration ,\u201d while Marco Rubio used a debate answer to praise the patience of immigrants who wait their turn for a visa . Trump said during the debate that he wants to build a wall on the border but would include \u201ca big beautiful door in that wall\u201d for legal entry.\n\nUntil it became a bargaining chip between LBJ and the Senate, the U.S.\u2019s southern neighbor had played almost no part in the discussion of Hart-Celler or in the decade-plus immigration-reform movement that had preceded it. In her book Impossible Subjects: Illegal Aliens and the Making of Modern America, Columbia University historian Mae Ngai notes that John F. Kennedy\u2019s pro-reform history A Nation of Immigrants, first published in 1958, \u201cdevoted all of two paragraphs to Asian and Latino immigration.\u201d And a 900-page 1950 Senate report about pressing immigration issues didn\u2019t mention illegal Mexican immigration at all.\n\nThe lack of national interest in Mexico did not necessarily reflect a lack of activity at the border, as Ngai documents in her book. In the decades before Hart-Celler was passed, as many as 450,000 Mexicans had been legally entering the United States each year using temporary work permits issued by the \u201cbracero\u201d program, which supplied a migrant workforce for farms in California, Texas, and elsewhere. On top of that huge influx, some 50,000 Mexicans annually entered the U.S. as permanent residents. Conditions were still far from ideal for Mexicans from a civil rights perspective: Farm employers often didn\u2019t live up to the terms of their contracts, underpaying bracero workers and housing them in grim conditions, while even legal Mexican-American citizens were subject to discrimination, segregation, and hostility. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of so-called \u201cwetbacks\u201d did enter the country illegally (often because of promised jobs) and were subject to raids and deportations. But the significant majority of Mexicans who came into the country did so under legal auspices.\n\nAll that changed when, within a matter of a year, the bracero program was terminated and Hart-Celler\u2019s Western Hemisphere immigration cap passed. The end of the bracero program was actually supposed to be a liberal reform that put an end to the systemic exploitation of Mexican workers. But once Hart-Celler went through, there were less than half as many visa slots allotted to the entire hemisphere as had been received in some previous years by Mexican migrants alone. (Liberal reformers do deserve some blame here, it should be said, for helping eliminate the temporary bracero visas and then immediately acceding to a compromise that drastically reduced the number of other legal options for entry.)\n\nYou likely already know what has happened in the half-century since Hart-Celler. Jobs for immigrants didn\u2019t disappear and in fact opened up in a number of industries besides agriculture. The Mexican workers who wanted those jobs didn\u2019t stop coming. (Princeton sociologist Doug Massey and his collaborators have found that \u201cinitiation of undocumented migration from Mexico is driven primarily by the pull of U.S. labor demand.\u201d) They simply arrived without immigration papers and instead of moving back and forth between Mexico and the U.S. as they often had in the days before strenuous border control, they began to settle here. (Roughly 50 percent of Mexicans making their first undocumented trip to the U.S. in 1970 returned to Mexico within a year. By 2005 that number was approximately 10 percent.) The \u201cillegal\u201d immigrant population, of which Mexicans make up more than half, rose steadily and peaked at an estimated 12.2 million in 2007. (One of the multiple ironies of Donald Trump\u2019s hysterical position on immigration is that because of deportation and emigration, the number of undocumented individuals residing in the U.S. has actually been falling for several years.)", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:47:10.061+0000"}

During Thursday night\u2019s Fox News debate, Trump made it clear that failing to secure the GOP nomination wouldn\u2019t stop him from exploring an independent candidacy. And honestly, he\u2019d be crazy not to. Trump is very far from a Republican regular. He represents an entirely different phenomenon, one that bears little resemblance to garden-variety American conservatism. That\u2019s why Republicans shouldn\u2019t fool themselves into believing that one lackluster debate performance will send him packing.\n\nGo to almost any European democracy and you will find that the parties of the center-right and center-left that have dominated the political scene since the Second World War are losing ground to new political movements. What these movements have in common is that they manage to blend populism and nationalism into a potent anti-establishment brew. One of the first political figures to perfect this brand of politics was the very Trumpian Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian media tycoon who rose to power as part of a coalition of right-of-center parties in the mid-1990s, and who has been in and out of power ever since, dodging corruption charges and worse all the while. More recently, the miserable state of Europe\u2019s economies has fueled the rise of dozens of other parties. Britain\u2019s Labour Party has been devastated by the rise not only of the leftist Scottish National Party, but also by UKIP, a movement of the right that has been growing at Labour\u2019s expense by campaigning against mass immigration, and by largely abandoning what had been its more libertarian line on the welfare state. UKIP\u2019s leader, Nigel Farage, has a penchant for bombast that endears him to his working-class base, which might sound familiar to you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Danish People\u2019s Party went from the far-right fringe to become Denmark\u2019s second-largest party by combining anti-immigration sentiment with a commitment to protecting social programs that serve native Danes. In neighboring Sweden, the Sweden Democrats are trying to pull off a similar feat, which is challenging in light of the party\u2019s neofascist roots. France\u2019s National Front has been a major player for decades, yet under its current leader, Marine Le Pen, is on the verge of a major electoral breakthrough, despite near-constant infighting. The most successful populist movements in southern Europe\u2014Podemos in Spain, the Five Star Movement in Italy, and Syriza in Greece\u2014are generally on the left rather than the right, yet they\u2019re just as aggressively anti-establishment as their right-wing counterparts.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:47:50.870+0000"}

The night also produced one predictable outcome: A massive chasm between how pundits and journalists reacted to Donald Trump\u2019s performance and how the public at large did.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe chattering class was near unanimous in its verdict: Trump lost. \u201cThe Trump bubble will burst,\u201d Politico\u2019s Mike Allen confidently declared after the debate. The current GOP frontrunner\u2019s momentum has stalled and is \u201c[definitely] not going up,\u201d predicted ABC News\u2019 Matthew Dowd. \u201cTrump was a clown show,\u201d tweeted Fox News contributor Stephen Hayes. \u201cThe last month has been Trump making the rest of the field look small; [Thursday] was the opposite,\u201d wrote National Review\u2019s Rick Lowry. \u201cFinally, perhaps we\u2019ve really seen peak Trump,\u201d concluded the Weekly Standard\u2019s Bill Kristol.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMuch of the public, though, saw something else entirely: A Trump victory. As of late Friday morning, more than 46 percent of the nearly half-million votes cast in a Drudge Report poll asking who won the prime-time debate went to the once-and-future reality TV star. In Time magazine\u2019s version of the survey, the real estate mogul claimed 47 percent of the more than 70,000 online responses. And even here at Slate\u2014not exactly the friendliest playing field for Trump\u2014the self-hype-man with the $10-million private jet garnered 39 percent of the roughly 44,000 votes that had been cast. In all three polls, meanwhile, the runner-up barely broke into the double-digits. Other online surveys showed similarly convincing wins for Trump.\n\nBut these competing instant-reactions each deserve giant disclaimers. First to the pundits: Previous predictions of The Donald\u2019s imminent demise were also a bust. To date, the belligerent billionaire has refused to obey even basic rules of campaign decorum, and yet his candidacy has yet to bend to the usual laws of politics that long-time observers hold dear.\n\nThey didn't tune in to see what Jeb Bush was going to do.\n\nMeanwhile, the online results rely on a self-selecting group of respondents with no regards to political affiliation, age, or even country; no one should mistake them for the scientific surveys done by professional pollsters. Online, a vote from a liberal who is laughing at Trump counts the same as one from a conservative who actually likes the man. The results also need the same necessary caveats we attach to the more scientific polls that currently show Trump leading the GOP field: The Donald may be the favorite right now, but his momentum is unsustainable, and his political future is bleak. If Trump\u2019s campaign doesn\u2019t end with a bang, it\u2019ll eventually go out with a whimper.\n\nSo how best to explain the current opinion gap between the professional class and the public? I think the more telling question isn\u2019t whether you think Donald Trump won or lost Thursday night\u2014it is whether you wanted him to win or lose going into the debate.\n\nPoliticos, pundits, and journalists see Trump as a sideshow that is preventing everyone from getting down to the serious business of selecting the GOP nominee. Many of us make no secret that we want him gone. So when the Fox News moderators roughed him up with a series of questions on everything from his views about women to his previous support for single-payer healthcare, it looked to us like Trump falling on his face.\n\nBut for many people watching at home, Trump didn\u2019t stumble\u2014he stood tall. They saw what they\u2019ve been seeing for months: A tough-talking businessman who refuses to back down and is incapable of apologizing. For a certain, significant subset of conservatives that\u2019s a message they\u2019ve been craving, and for others, it\u2019s one they\u2019re willing to entertain six months before the first actual nominating contest begins. It\u2019s also obvious that not everyone who watched the debate or voted in those polls is even a Republican primary voter\u2014many just wanted to enjoy the free show\u2014which means Trump\u2019s GOP support could still slip in the days to come. (A Fox News focus group of actual Republican voters, for instance, showed signs of turning on Trump after he refused to rule out a third-party run.)\n\nBut, regardless, the debate\u2019s massive ratings and those unscientific insta-polls remind us of a larger and more immediate truth: Love him or hate him, the public\u2019s thirst and curiosity for All Things Trump remains incredibly strong. The early overnight numbers suggest that Thursday\u2019s primetime event was the most watched primary debate in U.S. history\u2014potentially doubling the previous record. It\u2019s a safe bet that few of those people tuned in to see what Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, or even Ted Cruz was going to do. It\u2019s also a safe bet that many of them would be willing to watch a repeat performance from the man who stood center stage in Cleveland.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:47:55.435+0000"}

They\u2019re smarter than our leaders.\u201d When he was first asked to present his evidence for the claim during the first prime-time Republican debate, Trump deflected, dubiously claiming, \u201cif it weren\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris.\u201d When Wallace persisted in demanding evidence, here\u2019s what he got from the Donald:\n\nBorder Patrol, people that I deal with, that I talk to, they say this is what\u2019s happening. Because our leaders are stupid. Our politicians are stupid. And the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don\u2019t want to pay for them. They don\u2019t want to take care of them. Why should they when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them? And that\u2019s what is happening whether you like it or not.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTo get the obvious out of the way, this is ridiculous. Even the director of the Center for Immigration Studies, the influential anti-immigration think tank derided by some liberal critics as a hate group, dismissed the notion when contacted by PolitiFact.\n\nTrump\u2019s visions of Mexican masterminds outwitting the dummies in Washington is also a little odd given that Mexican President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto\u2019s government is currently being pilloried at home for its handling of the country\u2019s security situation, particularly after the country\u2019s most famous criminal was able to escape from prison with relative ease for a second time. If Mexico\u2019s leaders are so smart, sharp, and cunning when it comes to dealing with the country\u2019s criminal violence, it would probably come as news to most Mexicans.\n\nTrump\u2019s theory sounds somewhat reminiscent of the real 1980 incident in which Fidel Castro\u2019s government allowed hundreds of criminals and mentally ill people to travel to the U.S. during a mass emigration known as the Mariel boatlift in order to embarrass Washington. (Maybe he recently rewatched Scarface or something?) He seems to be suggesting something more long-term, though, and, again, he has no evidence for this preposterous theory.\n\nTrump\u2019s claim also ignores a few things, such as the fact that the number of unauthorized immigrants\u2014or \u201cillegals\u201d as they were repeatedly referred to during the Fox News debate\u2014in the United States has remained stable and the number of Mexican immigrants has declined. Numerous studies have also shown that immigrants, legal or illegal, are less likely to commit violent crimes or be incarcerated than native-born Americans. Also, as Sen. Marco Rubio correctly pointed out last night, unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. increasingly come not from Mexico, but from Central American countries.\n\nThere are better-thought-out versions of Trump\u2019s theory. Last year the conservative media took note of a border agreement between Guatemala and Mexico that would add more checkpoints to the border but also allow Guatamalans and Belizians to stay for 72 hours in Mexico\u2019s southern states on a temporary visitor\u2019s card, which U.S. critics argued was an open invitation to head north to the U.S. It\u2019s a stretch to call this an \u201cinternational conspiracy to violate America\u2019s laws and undermine our country\u2019s sovereignty\u201d as former presidential candidate Bob Barr did\u2014for one thing, Mexico actually now deports more Central Americans than the U.S.\u2014but it\u2019s at least a real known event that Trump could have pointed to rather than his supposed sources in the Border Patrol.\n\nBorder-related conspiracy theories are nothing new on the campaign trail. In 2008, candidates repeatedly faced questions about the supposed plans for a \u201cNorth American Union,\u201d creating a common currency for the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. (Ron Paul was the only one who endorsed the theory.)\n\nTrump\u2019s dastardly Mexican government plot has stolen the thunder from distant rival Rick Perry\u2019s suggestion last year that an \u201culterior motive\u201d may be leading the Obama administration to intentionally allow more undocumented immigration into the United States.

It\u2019s almost clich\u00e9, but the Florida senator is a gifted, empathetic communicator with a knack for blending policy with his personal story. But it\u2019s one thing to use those skills on the stump or during a meet and greet with supporters; it\u2019s something else to show them in the cramped confines of a presidential primary debate, especially when there are nine other candidates, at least one of whom is a wild card\u2014Donald Trump\u2014who could derail the entire conversation with a single tangent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut Rubio shined.

Take immigration, which consumed a huge chunk of the first hour of the debate.\n\nRubio didn\u2019t speak long, but when he had a chance, he gave the strongest\u2014 or at least the most digestible\u2014answer.\n\nJeb Bush began with a rote answer, meant to thread the needle between his past support for comprehensive reform and his present opposition. \u201cI believe that the great majority of people coming here illegally have no other option. They want to provide for their family,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we need to control our border. It\u2019s not\u2014it\u2019s our responsibility to pick and choose who comes in.\u201d\n\nBut while Bush spoke first, he didn\u2019t set the tone of the segment. That fell to Trump, who railed against the alleged danger of unauthorized immigrants: \u201cThe fact is, since then, many killings, murders, crime, drugs pouring across the border, are money going out and the drugs coming in. And I said we need to build a wall, and it has to be built quickly.\u201d After huge applause, moderator Chris Wallace pressed him for evidence of immigrant crime\u2014one early indication that the Fox News team was trying to undermine Trump as much as possible\u2014but the reality television star had an answer for that, too. \u201cThe Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning. And they send the bad ones over because they don\u2019t want to pay for them. They don\u2019t want to take care of them.\u201d\n\nNo candidate matched Trump in vehemence\u2014although Texas Sen. Ted Cruz tried as hard as he could\u2014but several candidates tried to walk a similar, if less bigoted, line. Even Ohio Gov. John Kasich\u2014a relative moderate\u2014praised Trump for \u201chitting a nerve\u201d with the country on immigration.\n\nEnter Rubio. In substance, he\u2019s not far from his more mainstream colleagues. But he didn\u2019t indulge Trump\u2019s affect. Instead, he gave a fact check and a strong answer on border security and the realities of the immigration process:\n\nLet me set the record straight on a couple of things. The first is, the evidence is now clear that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico. They\u2019re coming from Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras. Those countries are the source of the people that are now coming in its majority.\n\nI also believe we need a fence. The problem is if El Chapo builds a tunnel under the fence, we have to be able to deal with that too. And that\u2019s why you need an e-verify system and you need an entry-exit tracking system and all sorts of other things to prevent illegal immigration. But I agree with what Gov. Kasich just said. People are frustrated. This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States, and people feel like we\u2019re being taken advantage of. We feel like, despite our generosity, we\u2019re being taken advantage of.\n\nThe people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they\u2019ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can\u2019t get in. And they\u2019re wondering, maybe they should come illegally.\n\nThis was a forceful answer, delivered with compassion and confidence. Compare it with Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s, which was muddled, to say the least. Walker said he was \u201clistening\u201d to the American people and warned the audience of the \u201cinternational criminal organizations penetrating our Southern-based borders.\u201d It was milquetoast, the kind of answer you give when you\u2019re not exactly prepared.\n\nAnd this, indeed, was the pattern of the entire debate. Rubio didn\u2019t speak long, but when he had a chance, he gave the strongest\u2014or at least the most digestible\u2014answer. When Kelly challenged him on abortion, for instance\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t favor a rape and incest exception?\u201d\u2014Rubio denied his prior votes for these exceptions and replied with a television-ready line:\n\nI have never said that. And I have never advocated that. What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection.\n\nIn fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThe audience loved it.\n\nThe practical impact of Rubio\u2019s strong performance\u2014and of the middling showing from Walker and Bush, who stumbled over lackluster answers\u2014is to boost his modest standing among Republican voters. Unlike Cruz, who is divisive and unelectable, or Gov. Chris Christie\u2014who is a tad too moderate for national GOP tastes\u2014Rubio\u2019s problem has more to do with circumstance than affect or ideology. With experienced candidates like Walker and quasi-consensus figures like Bush, he is surrounded by credible contenders. And despite his obvious skills, he can\u2019t quite show why he is the choice over them.

Here are some of the heresies that slipped out.\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\n1. The Iraq war was a mistake. Jeb Bush has waffled on this, but on Thursday he decisively bit the bullet. He said he had equivocated because \u201cit was difficult for me\u201d after talking to families of dead soldiers who believed that their loved ones \u201cdid not die in vain.\u201d But Bush concluded: \u201cKnowing what we know now, with faulty intelligence, and not having security be the first priority when we invaded, it was a mistake.

Rand Paul for having \u201cblamed the rise of ISIS on Republican hawks.\u201d Baier quoted Paul\u2019s criticism of the hawks: \u201cEverything they\u2019ve talked about in foreign policy, they\u2019ve been wrong for the last 20 years.\u201d In the debate, Paul stipulated that ISIS was solely responsible for its atrocities. But he also blasted \u201cRepublicans who wanted to send arms to the allies of ISIS. ISIS rides around in a billion dollars\u2019 worth of U.S. Humvees. \u2026 We shouldn\u2019t fund our enemies.\u201d\n\n3. We couldn\u2019t sustain international sanctions on Iran. Nearly all the Republicans have maintained the proud fiction that if Congress were to reject the nuclear agreement with Iran, or if the next president were to renounce it, we could stiffen the world\u2019s resolve and get a better deal. As Gov. Scott Walker put it in the prime-time debate: \u201cYou terminate the deal on Day One, you reinstate the sanctions authorized by Congress, you go to Congress and put in place even more crippling sanctions in place, and then you convince our allies to do the same.\u201d But in the undercard debate, Carly Fiorina confessed the truth: \u201cI hope Congress says no to this deal. But realistically, even if they do, the money is flowing. China and Russia have never been on our side of the table. The Europeans have moved on.\u201d That\u2019s the unpleasant reality: We got as good a deal as we could, given the difficulties of our coalition.\n\nThe Republican Party isn\u2019t willing to nominate someone who\u2019s open to reality on most of these issues.\n\n4. You can\u2019t cut the deficit without cutting entitlements. Republicans love to pretend they can balance the budget by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse. Paul\u2019s favorite target, for instance, is origami condoms. But on Thursday night, Gov. Chris Christie rebuked his colleagues with some basic math. \u201cSeventy-one percent of federal spending right now is on entitlement and debt service,\u201d said Christie. \u201cWe have spent the last hour and five minutes talking about the other 29 percent and no time on the 71 percent, and that makes no sense. Now, let me tell you exactly what we would do on Social Security.\u201d When Mike Huckabee replied that Congress should cut its own retirement program instead, Christie retorted, \u201cWe can't fix the problem just by ending Congress\u2019 retirement.\u201d Gesturing to show how meager the savings would be, Christie scoffed, \u201cThat\u2019s worth about this much.\u201d\n\n5. People need Social Security. Economic stratification and wage stagnation have made several Republicans surprisingly vocal about defending checks from the government. \u201cHalf of American seniors would be in poverty without a Social Security check,\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham observed in Thursday\u2019s undercard debate. In the prime-time debate, Huckabee chimed in: \u201cSixty million Americans are on Social Security\u201460 million. A third of those people depend on 90 percent of their income from Social Security.\u201d Huckabee complained that politicians in both parties try to balance the books \u201coff the backs of people, many of whom are poor, and depend on that money.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:48:47.184+0000"}

He is. He\u2019s hitting a nerve,\u201d said Kasich. \u201cPeople are frustrated, they\u2019re fed up, they don\u2019t think the government\u2019s working for them. And for people who want to tune him out, they\u2019re making a mistake.\u201d\n\nThat is the kind of answer that thrills his supporters but doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problem. In fact, it may worsen it.\n\nTrump reached with bravado and no apologies. The answer that showed both his strength and his vulnerability was when he was asked about some of his comments regarding women. He was reminded that he\u2019d called women he didn't like \u201cfat pigs,\u201d \u201cdogs,\u201d \u201cslobs,\u201d and \u201cdisgusting animals.\u201d Female voters are kind of important, especially against a Democratic nominee who is likely to be a woman. That\u2019s a general-election liability\u2014a glaring one. Trump responded by taking a stand against political correctness. \u201cI don\u2019t frankly have time for total political correctness. And to be honest with you, this country doesn\u2019t have time either.\u201d\n\nTrump took it on the chin early. He was on the defensive over his descriptions of women, his donations to Hillary Clinton, and his bankruptcies. Perhaps the hardest problem for him was the underlying question, \u201cWhen did you actually become a Republican?\u201d\n\nThe Republican front-runner received a mix of boos and applause throughout the evening. No surprise there. He\u2019s ahead in the polls but also leading his competitors when people are asked which candidate they\u2019d never vote for. So Trump\u2019s challenge was to figure out how to lift the iron ceiling that caps his vote total. There was nothing in his debate performance that suggests he accomplished that.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the only time he\u2019d do that during the evening in which he called the nation's leaders stupid and occasionally stopped to school his questioners. \u201cLet me just tell you about the lenders,\u201d he said when asked about the $1 billion that he lost in his Atlantic City investments. \u201cFirst of all, these lenders aren\u2019t babies. These are total killers. These are not the nice, sweet little people that you think, OK?\u201d\n\nAt the start of the debate, the question was whether Trump would play it safe or bring the bombast. There was very little analysis about what he would do with his hands, but right off the bat his hand raising caused an uproar. Trump refused to pledge to support the eventual nominee of the party. He did say that he would support himself. He also declined to pledge that he wouldn\u2019t run as an independent, something many Republicans believe would guarantee a Democratic victory. \u201cI\u2019m, you know, talking about a lot of leverage,\u201d said Trump. When the audience booed, he brought up both hands as if to say, \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nDonald Trump gave the debate passion because he has increased the peril for the other candidates, who are trailing him in the polls. The real estate tycoon has excited the desire for candor in the electorate, and other candidates are trying to show their own version of it. The spark may also be there because he\u2019s insulted so many of his opponents and they want to take him down.\n\nIf Republicans were hoping the first debate would help them winnow the field, there\u2019s always next time. None of the top 10 candidates in the prime-time debate had a gaffe. Almost all of them had at least one distinguishing moment. In the undercard debate, Carly Fiorina did well enough that she may have just become the 11 th candidate in the mix.\n\nWhat a show the first GOP debate was! A rock \u2019em, sock \u2019em affair full of heated exchanges, punches, and counterpunches. It was entertaining and informative, for which viewers can thank the Fox News moderators and Donald Trump.\n\nThe other great non\u2013Trump-related bit of theater was an exchange between Paul and Gov. Chris Christie over the use of surveillance techniques. Christie, who pointed out he\u2019d used the Patriot Act as a federal prosecutor, said Paul was just blowing \u201chot air\u201d in committee rooms. Paul then was in a position to deliver a set-piece line about giving too much power to the president: \u201cI don\u2019t trust President Obama with our records. I know you gave him a big hug, and if you want to give him a big hug again, go right ahead.\u201d\n\nChristie shot back: \u201cSen. Paul, you know, the hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on Sept. 11.\u201d He then accused Paul of using his Senate speeches to raise money.\n\nIt was exciting. Perhaps the excitement came from two candidates trying to pull themselves up from the bottom of the polls. Perhaps it was a display of genuine passion about issues each man cares about and that are important to the electorate. We could do worse than that.\n\nWho got the better of the Paul-Christie exchange? It was probably a draw, but Christie has the chance to benefit more because he has more room to improve with a larger group of voters. Paul\u2019s defense of the Fourth Amendment was passionate, but he\u2019s already got the constituency for whom that is an abiding concern. Christie may have been able to use the exchange to show people that he\u2019s tough on national security and would let nothing slip on the fight against terrorists. That\u2019s a larger group in the Republican Party. On entitlement reforms and national security, Christie was more commanding than blustery. All those policy speeches he has given have paid off. He sounds like he has a command of the material.\n\nKasich, the hometown boy, had several good moments. Defending his Medicaid program, he spoke about the obligation to care for those in the shadows of society. When asked about how he would explain his opposition to same-sex marriage if one of his daughters said she was gay, he gave a big-hearted and inclusive response. The Cleveland audience loved it. By the end of the debate, Kasich had thoroughly captured the \u201ccompassionate conservative\u201d label.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio had two strong moments. One was when he explained why he can go toe to toe with Hillary Clinton: \u201cIf I\u2019m our nominee, how is Hillary Clinton gonna lecture me about living paycheck to paycheck? I was raised paycheck to paycheck.\u201d\n\nLater he took a question about immigration, which will be a tough issue for him since he worked with Democrats on comprehensive immigration reform, and turned it into a defense of those who try to come to America legally. \u201cAnd let me tell you who never gets talked about in these debates: the people that call my office, who have been waiting for 15 years to come to the United States. And they\u2019ve paid their fees, and they hired a lawyer, and they can\u2019t get in. And they\u2019re wondering, maybe they should come illegally.\u201d\n\nBut Rubio has no executive experience and he looks young. His answers were delivered with force at times, which will test a proposition David Axelrod talked about during Obama\u2019s campaign: If you sound assertive and in command, will people grant you the leadership skills that you've never displayed in your career?\n\nJeb Bush hopes to be there at the end of this battle, the safe, calm, respectable choice. He played that role Thursday night. His best answers were defending his education record and explaining why Donald Trump\u2019s tone mattered. He said he called out Trump because \u201cI want to win.\u201d He was more passionate than he had been all evening. He had to articulate his argument for his campaign with energy\u2014and because Trump forced him to by acting out and putting him in a position where he had to actually spell out what\u2019s at stake.\n\nMike Huckabee and Ben Carson each had a moment. Huckabee passionately argued against President Obama\u2019s deal with Iran, and Carson offered an appealing defense of his outside wisdom, as well as a pitch for a colorblind society that appeals to conservatives. \u201cWhen I take someone to the operating room, I\u2019m actually operating on the thing that makes them who they are. The skin doesn\u2019t make them who they are. The hair doesn\u2019t make them who they are. And it\u2019s time for us to move beyond that.\u201d\n\nThat leaves us with Gov. Scott Walker and Sen. Ted Cruz. Their supporters won\u2019t be disappointed. Walker was cautious, offering snippets of his stump speech. Cruz was familiar in his articulation of his principled stances.

Bush before him.)\n\nFiorina also said that, on her first day in office, she would tear up the Iran nuclear deal, after calling her \u201cgood friend Bibi Netanyahu,\u201d and then, on the second day, hold a summit with our Arab allies, including her \u201cfriend King Abdullah of Jordan.\u201d These acts and conversations would send a signal that \u201cAmerica is back in the leadership business.\u201d At the moment that she said this, the ambassadors from Britain, France, and Germany were urging 30 members of Congress to support the Iran deal, saying that rejection would trigger a \u201cnightmare\u201d and a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d\u2014thus sending a signal that they were fine with American leadership as is.\n\nRick Perry, who probably came to the debate fully prepped to recite the three cabinet departments he\u2019d abolish, said that thousands of Americans have died in Lebanon and Iran\u2014among several other incoherent statements.

Rand Paul and Gov. Chris Christie clashed over the National Security Agency, Christie wanting to expand its surveillance tools, Paul to curtail them. Paul also called for slashing foreign aid, including to Israel. And while he criticized the Iran deal, like the other Republican candidates, he also said, \u201cI don\u2019t immediately discount negotiations,\u201d noting that Ronald Reagan negotiated with the Russians. None of these comments drew much applause.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz ridiculed Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, for recently testifying that there is no military solution to defeating ISIS, and that the socio-political conditions on the ground need to change. \u201cThat is nonsense,\u201d Cruz said of what specialists in the region regard as a basic truism. His solution for crushing ISIS: Kill Americans who join any jihadi movement, and elect a president unafraid to utter the words \u201cradical Islamic terrorists.\u201d\n\nGov. Jeb Bush acknowledged that invading Iraq was a bad idea, in retrospect, but then turned the table, saying, \u201cHere\u2019s the lesson we should take from this: Barack Obama became president, and he abandoned Iraq.\u201d Bush ignored the fact that his brother\u2019s administration signed the Status of Forces Agreement of 2008, requiring all U.S. forces to withdraw from Iraq by the end of 2011.\n\nBen Carson\u2014the neurosurgeon who boasted of having separated Siamese twins\u2014defended waterboarding, saying, \u201cWhat we need to do to get our information is our business,\u201d and \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a politically correct war.\u201d\n\nCarson also recited some numbers he\u2019d learned\u2014that our Navy is the smallest since 1917 and our Air Force the smallest since 1940\u2014ignoring that one Navy ship today has far more firepower and maneuverability than the entire fleet of an earlier era.\n\nMike Huckabee went the same route, noting that the Air Force is flying some B-52s that are older than he is. This ignores a few things: B-52s are hardly the newest planes in the fleet; they\u2019ve been upgraded, to the point of being rebuilt, many times; and, given their current mission\u2014dropping conventional smart bombs from very high altitudes\u2014they\u2019re performing just fine.\n\nHuckabee also fanned the flames on the Iran deal. \u201cWe got nothing,\u201d he said, while \u201cIran gets everything they want\u201d\u2014ignoring that the deal requires Iran to slash its enriched uranium by 98 percent, its stock of centrifuges by two-thirds, and much, much more.

Brett Baier opened by asking the candidates onstage to pledge their fealty to the Republican Party.

He lives in Iowa City.\n\nFor two hours, Baier, Kelly, and Chris Wallace kept 10 Republican hopefuls on topic and within their time limits. The moderators never allowed the debate to became a free-for-all, nor, worse, a one-for-all. They asked well-worded and thought-out questions that highlighted major differences within the Republican Party on a number of topics, including immigration, Social Security, and national surveillance\u2014the last of which prompted one of the more memorable clashes of the night. \u201cI don\u2019t trust President Obama with our records,\u201d Rand Paul told Chris Christie, adding: \u201cI know you gave him a big hug.\u201d Christie shot back: \u201cThe hugs that I remember are the hugs that I gave to the families who lost their people on Sept. 11.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAnd when the Fox News trio couldn\u2019t lead the candidates into the ring with one another, they put on the gloves themselves.

They pressed Ben Carson on foreign policy and his general political inexperience, Mike Huckabee on Social Security, and Ted Cruz on his divisiveness. And they went after Ohio hometown hero John Kasich on his decision to accept Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion and his opposition to gay marriage.\n\nThe trio was even more aggressive when it came to two of the men in the middle of the stage. They questioned Jeb Bush about three of his biggest perceived liabilities: Common Core, immigration, and the Iraq war.

When, as expected, Trump raised his hand, Baier made sure the stakes were clear to everyone. \u201cAn independent run would almost certainly hand the race over to Democrats and likely another Clinton,\u201d Baier told Trump. \u201cYou can't say tonight that you can make that pledge?\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t get any easier for The Donald from there.

{"entityId": 266, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images\n\nSen. Chuck Schumer will break with the Obama White House to vote against the nuclear deal with Iran, according to a statement the New York Democrat posted late Thursday on Medium. Schumer\u2019s intention to oppose the deal was reported earlier in the evening by the Huffington Post, but his reluctance to lend his support has been noted by the press for weeks, with the senator unwilling to commit as recently as two weeks ago to do more than \u201creview\u201d the provisions of the deal.\n\nIn his statement, Schumer indicates that his opposition is ultimately based in skepticism that the deal will have the intended outcome:\n\nIf one thinks Iran will moderate, that contact with the West and a decrease in economic and political isolation will soften Iran\u2019s hardline positions, one should approve the agreement. After all, a moderate Iran is less likely to exploit holes in the inspection and sanctions regime, is less likely to seek to become a threshold nuclear power after ten years, and is more likely to use its newfound resources for domestic growth, not international adventurism.\n\nBut if one feels that Iranian leaders will not moderate and their unstated but very real goal is to get relief from the onerous sanctions, while still retaining their nuclear ambitions and their ability to increase belligerent activities in the Middle East and elsewhere, then one should conclude that it would be better not to approve this agreement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Huffington Post details the pressure on Schumer to oppose the agreement in order to live up to his reputation as a staunch defender of Israel:\n\nSchumer has a sizable Jewish constituency and has developed close ties to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the influential pro-Israel lobbying group that has pledged over $20 million to kill the nuclear accord. During his 34 years in Congress, Schumer has become fond of telling his voters that his surname is derived from \u201cshomer,\u201d the Hebrew word for \u201cguardian.\u201d \u201cI am a shomer for Israel and I will continue to be that with every bone in my body,\u201d he said in 2010.\n\nBut to his more hawkish pro-Israel constituents, Schumer\u2019s hesitation to announce his position and his failure to whip fellow Democrats against the deal demonstrate a betrayal of this promise. \u201cSchumer, you are no shomer,\u201d yelled a crowd of 10,000 protesters rallying against the Iran deal in New York City's Times Square last month. \u201cWhere is Chuck? Kill this deal!\u201d they chanted.\n\nSchumer is reportedly willing to maintain his opposition in the face of a presidential veto should the \u201cno\u201d votes prevail when the Senate takes up the matter after its August recess.\n\nSchumer aide says he would ALSO vote to override presidential veto on Iran deal disapporoval. \u2014 Todd Zwillich (@toddzwillich) August 7, 2015\n\nSchumer might have been moved to act by the announcement, earlier Thursday, that the agreement had gained two Democratic supporters in the Senate, with Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Schumer's fellow New Yorker Kirsten Gillibrand indicating that they would vote in favor. The timing of his statement, which was posted one hour into the first Republican primary debate of the season, does not appear to be a play for massive media attention.\n\nUpdate, Aug. 7, 9:00 a.m.: One possible explanation for Schumer dropping his announcement during the debate, from Politico:\n\nThe New York senator had told the White House that he had decided to reject the nuclear agreement and would announce it on Friday. But the source accused the White House of leaking Schumer\u2019s decision to the Huffington Post, forcing the senator to announce his decision Thursday night.\n\nOnce the frenzy of debate analysis had died down Thursday night, reactions to Schumer's statement started to trickle out. While few expressed shock at his decision to oppose the agreement with Iran, it was nonetheless somewhat jarring to see the man expected to take over leadership of Senate Democrats come out against one of President Obama's legacy-level priorites.\n\nSome progressives have promised renewed pressure on Democrats to ditch Schumer as presumed Minority Leader or be starved of contributions, the Hill reports:\n\nMoveOn.org announced a \"donor strike\" after the New York Democrat's announcement that he opposes the Iran deal and compared him to Joseph I. Lieberman, while former senior White House aide Dan Pfeiffer warned the Democratic base wouldn\u2019t support Schumer for leader.\n\nMoveOn said its eight million members will withhold funding for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and from any Democratic candidate who sides with Schumer.\n\nOne demographic had no shortage of criticism for Schumer's break from the White House: former Obama staffers with Twitter accounts.\n\nSenator Schumer siding with the GOP against Obama, Clinton, and most Democrats will make it hard for him to lead the Dems in '16 \u2014 Dan Pfeiffer (@danpfeiffer) August 7, 2015\n\nTimely endorsement of the foreign policy of the GOP candidates on stage from Chuck Schumer ... \u2014 Ben LaBolt (@BenLaBolt) August 7, 2015", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:49:03.846+0000"}

{"entityId": 273, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Brian Snyder/Reuters\n\nThe first debate of the 2016 Republican presidential primaries is in the books. Only the lower tier of candidates participated in this undercard event, so it\u2019s just a partial glimpse of the campaign ahead. But already we have some early signs of who will be the scapegoats in this election.\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\n1. Muslims. This one\u2019s easy. We\u2019re at war with ISIS, we\u2019ve had several domestic jihadist attacks, and Republicans hate the deal with Iran. Also, American Muslims don\u2019t yet have enough political power to fight back. So it\u2019s a free-fire zone. Thursday night\u2019s assault opened with Gov. Bobby Jindal castigating President Obama for daring to \u201ccriticize medieval Christians\u201d while refusing \u201cto say that Islam has a problem.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nShortly afterward, George Pataki was asked whether conservatives\u2019 stated concern for \u201creligious liberty\u201d should extend to Muslims. The question was: \u201cWould you put mosques, for example, potentially, under surveillance?\u201d Pataki replied that \u201creligious liberty doesn't include encouraging a fellow American to engage in violent jihad.\u201d He said people who \u201cradicalize other Americans\u201d must be \u201cshut down, whether or not they\u2019re in prisons preaching, or in mosques preaching.\u201d He also pledged to \u201cshut down their Internet capability.\u201d The limits of these pledges, in terms of the content of the speech being targeted, were left unclear.\n\nThe Muslim issue returned out of nowhere a few minutes later, when Sen. Lindsey Graham, answering a question about public assistance, turned the conversation to ISIS and then abruptly exclaimed: \u201cIf I have to monitor a mosque, I'll monitor a mosque.\u201d When candidates are reaching for your group to score points on totally unrelated questions, that\u2019s a pretty strong indicator that you\u2019re in for a long, rough ride.\n\n2. Immigrants. Three months ago I flagged Rick Santorum for pushing the immigration debate into new territory. Other candidates were complaining about illegal immigrants, but Santorum was forthrightly denouncing legal immigration as a flood of foreigners taking American jobs. Thursday night\u2019s debate, in conjunction with other recent comments by the candidates, suggests that the rest of the GOP field may be following Santorum\u2019s lead.\n\nWhen candidates are reaching for your group to score points on totally unrelated questions, you\u2019re in for a rough ride.\n\nIn recent forums there\u2019s been more talk from other Republicans about reining in legal immigration. Thursday, Santorum tried to reassert his status as the trailblazer on this issue. He pointed to the support Donald Trump has won from activists and in polls by targeting immigration. Of Democrats, Santorum said: \u201cAll they care about is votes. They don\u2019t care about American workers. They just care about bringing as many people in so they can get as many votes as they can.\u201d Illegal immigrants can\u2019t vote, so when Santorum complains about immigrants voting for Democrats, it sounds like he\u2019s talking about people who are here legally. He continued: \u201cI\u2019m the only one on this stage who has a plan that\u2019s actually going to reduce immigration, actually going to do something to help the American worker.\u201d Santorum didn\u2019t say \u201creduce illegal immigration.\u201d He said \u201creduce immigration.\u201d\n\nBut immigration, as an issue in the GOP primaries, isn\u2019t just about economics. It\u2019s also about culture. Jindal made that clear in his closing statement. \u201cWe must insist on assimilation,\u201d said Jindal. \u201cImmigration without assimilation is an invasion. We need to tell folks who want to come here: They need to come here legally, they need to learn English, adopt our values, roll up their sleeves, and get to work.\u201d This wasn\u2019t in response to a question, mind you. This was the issue Jindal elected to close on. And he wasn\u2019t talking about securing a border. He was talking about a cultural \u201cinvasion.\u201d\n\nWhen the candidates were asked about families who would be broken apart by deportation or other efforts to purge illegal immigrants, they had no answers. Santorum changed the subject to \u201cunskilled workers\u201d who were immigrating legally and \u201cflattening wages.\u201d Rick Perry also ducked the question and talked instead about his favorite subject: securing the border.\n\n3. Planned Parenthood. Abortion is a favorite issue in Republican primaries, especially when you\u2019re trying to knock off a candidate who seems squishier than you. Carly Fiorina was the first candidate Thursday night\u2014but probably won\u2019t be the last, by the time the second debate has concluded\u2014to use the issue against Trump. She tartly remarked: \u201cSince he has changed his mind on amnesty, on health care, and on abortion, I would just ask: What are the principles by which he will govern?\u201d\n\nThe tricky aspect of this issue is standing up for babies without looking as though you\u2019re targeting women. Planned Parenthood seems to solve that problem. The recently released videos of Planned Parenthood officials chatting coolly about late-term abortions and procuring fetal body parts have given Republicans a fat target for their anti-abortion message. The videos focus the debate on late-term abortions, and they put a large, government-funded organization\u2014not individual women\u2014in the rhetorical crosshairs.\n\nThe candidates seem to have learned from Jeb Bush, who got himself in trouble earlier this week by suggesting that too much money was being spent on women\u2019s health care. Thursday, Graham made clear that any government money not spent on Planned Parenthood should stay with women: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a war on women for all of us as Americans to stand up and stop harvesting organs from little babies. Let\u2019s take the money that we would give to Planned Parenthood and put it in women\u2019s health care without having to harvest the organs of the unborn.\u201d\n\nBut there\u2019s a catch. Planned Parenthood does a lot more than abortions. It provides contraception, pregnancy tests, exams for sexually transmitted infections, and many other reproductive health services. So when Republicans go after it, they risk wandering into territory that could provoke a backlash. Jindal, for instance, said in his closing statement:\n\nUnder President Jindal, January 2017, the Department of Justice and the IRS and everybody else that we can send from the federal government will be going in to Planned Parenthood. This is absolutely disgusting and revolts the conscience of the nation. Absolutely we need to defund Planned Parenthood. In my own state, for example, we launched an investigation, asked the FBI to cooperate. We just earlier this week kicked them out of Medicaid in Louisiana as well, canceled their provider contract. They don\u2019t provide any abortions in Louisiana.\n\nWhen Jindal says Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t provide any abortions in Louisiana, that\u2019s not because of Jindal\u2019s order. It was true before he acted. As the Wall Street Journal notes, Jindal \u201cannounced his state will end its Medicaid contract with the nonprofit, even though Planned Parenthood doesn\u2019t provide abortions in the state.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:49:16.415+0000"}

{"entityId": 277, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Fox News\n\nAbout midway through Thursday\u2019s early Fox News GOP debate for second-tier 2016 Republican primary candidates, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina offered the fiercest attack of the night on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhile he didn\u2019t actually answer the question he was being asked\u2014which was how Americans could become less reliant on government assistance\u2014Graham showed an extraordinary understanding of what the 2016 election is actually about: Whether or not a Republican will undo Barack Obama\u2019s agenda of his past two presidential terms, or whether a Democrat (likely Hillary) will keep that status quo in place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cTo all the Americans who want a better life, don\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Graham said. \u201cShe\u2019s not going to repeal Obamacare and replace it, I will. She\u2019s not going to build the Keystone pipeline, I will. She\u2019s not going to change Dodd-Frank, I will.\u201d\n\nThe tone of Graham\u2019s remarks was odd, making it sound like he was already in a one-on-one contest with Clinton, when he is actually near the very bottom of the crowded Republican field. But the actual substance for what he was saying describes incredibly well what is at stake in the 2016 election. Because the size of the current GOP House majority is so large, it is unlikely that Clinton would be able to take back the Congress even if she (or another Democrat) were to win the presidency.\n\nThat means that any agenda Clinton wanted to enact would likely face the same firewall of opposition in Congress that Obama\u2019s agenda has faced since the Republicans took back control of the House in 2010. So what\u2019s really being fought over is whether or not a Republican president, House, and Senate undo Obama\u2019s domestic and foreign policy achievements, or a Democratic president preserves them.\n\n\u201cUntil you change the policies of Barack Obama, we\u2019re never going to grow this economy. Until you change the policies of Barack Obama, we\u2019re never going to be safe,\u201d Graham continued. \u201cShe represents a third term of a failed presidency.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just domestic policy changes, like repealing the Affordable Care Act or pushing through the Keystone XL pipeline over the objections of environmentalists that Graham promised to change. In terms of American security, Graham is one of the most vocal opponents of Obama\u2019s Iran deal, and he emphasized that America\u2019s foreign policy would be a lot different under a Republican president. Responding to an earlier question in the debate about whether or not former New York Gov. George Pataki would \u201cput a mosque under surveillance,\u201d Graham was adamant that, yes, he would if need be. He also seemed to say that he would be willing to send American troops into combat \u201cto protect us here,\u201d while Clinton wouldn\u2019t.\n\n\u201cIf I have to send more American troops to protect us here, I will do it,\u201d Graham said. \u201cShe will not.\u201d\n\nIt wasn\u2019t clear where Graham wanted to send troops, but he was one of the most bellicose voices at a recent hearing about the Iran deal, berating Defense Secretary Ashton Carter with repeated questions about \u201cwho wins the war between us and Iran\u201d and declaring \u201cWe win!\u201d\n\nObama has said that the choice in his Iran deal is one between peace and war, and it is widely opposed in the Republican field, including by Graham.\n\nWhich is part of the problem for Graham with his attack on Clinton. Sure, he would do all the things that he described, and Clinton would not. But so would every single other GOP candidate. He offered no distinguishing feature between himself and the entire rest of the field, the vast majority of which he trails.\n\nPerhaps the only way that he stood out is that he showed himself willing and ready to link Bill Clinton\u2019s 1990s prevarication about sex scandals to Hillary Clinton being less than 100 percent forthright about the personal email account she used while serving as secretary of state.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m fluent in Clinton-speak, I\u2019ve been dealing with this crowd for 20 years.

But she is afraid of the repercussions this could bring:\n\nI have no guarantee of what they will do with this information or whom they might share it with. I also fear that they will reinstate my account using my full name, including my caste name. This could have dangerous implications for my family members in India.\n\nThe caste system in India is a deeply entrenched, centuries-old system of class hierarchy under which some castes are more vulnerable than others.

The journalists, Markus Beckedahl and Andre Meister, run the investigative blog Netzpolitik with 30 other writers, and they report primarily on surveillance and privacy issues in Germany. The investigation was widely criticized as an attack on press freedom, and thousands of Netzpolitik supporters marched in Berlin to support their cause.

So we decided to take a look at the paper of record\u2019s first mention of all the other candidates in the race. Not just biographical footnotes, many feel like time capsules of debates and elections long forgotten.\n\n(Note: A few context-less mentions in lists of election candidates have been excluded.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDonald Trump\n\nDate: Oct. 16, 1973\n\nHeadline: \u201cMajor Landlord Accused of Antiblack Bias in City\u201d\n\nMention: At the corporation\u2019s main office, 600 Avenue Z in Brooklyn, Donald Trump, president, denied the charges. \u201cThey are absolutely ridiculous,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have never discriminated and we never would.\u201d\n\nContext: The bombastic former real estate magnate who still has a penchant for racially-charged rhetoric first made waves when his company was charged with violating the Fair Housing Act for, as the Times put it, refusing to rent or negotiate rentals \u201cbecause of race or color.\u201d requiring different terms for renters based on race, and misrepresenting \u201cto blacks that apartments were not available.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\n\nDate: July 3, 1978\n\nHeadline: \u201cNew Faces in Southern Politics: Women, Young and \u2018Outsiders\u2019\u201d\n\nMention: \u201cFinally, the attack focused on the fact that Mr. Clinton\u2019s wife, a politically active lawyer he met at Yale, has retained her maiden name,\u201d Howell Raines wrote at the time. Raines quotes Bill Clinton as saying: \u201cThey talk about \u2018Clinton\u2019s wife\u2019\u2026 and then they\u2019d say \u2018Ms. Hillary Rodham\u2019 in a sneering tone.

The couple may have brushed off the attacks about Hillary keeping her name at the time, but by Bill\u2019s 1982 gubernatorial campaign she was going by Hillary Clinton.\n\nJeb Bush\n\nDate: Feb. 18, 1980\n\nHeadline: \u201cBush Defeats Baker in Puerto Rico Race\u201d\n\nMention: \u201cHernan Padilla, the mayor of San Juan, attributed Mr. Bush\u2019s success to several factors. He said Mr. Bush had appeared charismatic and intense early in the campaign, especially in his television advertising, and he said it was important that Jeb Bush, Mr. Bush\u2019s 26-year-old son, had spent nearly two months in Puerto Rico. The Mayor said that some of Mr. Bush\u2019s success could be attributed to the fact that Jeb Bush speaks fluent Spanish.\u201d\n\nContext: Jeb\u2019s fluency, acquired on a teaching stint in Mexico where he also met his future wife, might have helped his dad win the 1980 Puerto Rico primary, but Ronald Reagan would take the nomination.\n\nBernie Sanders\n\nDate: March 8, 1981\n\nHeadline: \u201cVermont Socialist Plans Mayoralty With Bias Toward Poor\u201d\n\nMention: \u201cOlive branches and soothing balm seemed in order, and so Bernie Sanders, a 39-year-old, self-styled Socialist from Flatbush who surprised Vermont on Tuesday by narrowly being elected Mayor of its largest city, was being careful to sound conciliatory.\u201d\n\nContext: Sanders got the full article treatment when he was elected mayor of Burlington, Vermont in 1981, pledging to govern with a \u201cdefinite class analysis.\u201d The olive branches evidently didn\u2019t work on the Democrat he defeated, who predicted that people would soon \u201cbe paying $10 a head to see the freak Mayor of Burlington.\u201d\n\nGeorge Pataki\n\nDate: June 27, 1982\n\nHeadline: Westchester Journal\n\nMention: \u201cAnyone with a fondness for the Hudson would have welcomed the scene Wednesday evening at Riverfront Green, an eight-acre park and docking area on Peekskill's waterfront.

Allen, and the nominee for attorney general, James S. Gilmore 3d, a Richmond-area prosecutor, both took pains to find a few kind words about him and his agenda and not to anger him or his supporters.\n\nContext: The article noted how the resurgence of the Christian right was splitting the southern GOP between \u201crock hard conservatives\u201d like Allen and Gilmore, and \u201cdiamond hard\u201d ones like Farris, a candidate for lieutenant governor. Farris lost the general election, while Allen and Gilmore won.\n\nChris Christie\n\nDate: April 27, 1995\n\nHeadline: \u201cNew Jersey Daily Briefing: Freeholders Regret \u2018Oversight\u2019\u201d\n\nMention: \u201c\u2018It was really just an absolute oversight, a totally unintentional thing,\u2019 said Freeholder Chris Christie.\u201d\n\nContext: Christie, who had been elected as a freeholder (essentially, a county legislator) for Morris County, New Jersey, got his first mention in the Times for defending the Board of Chosen Freeholders (the county legislature) for violating a law on holding open public meetings\u2014something that still seems to be an issue in the state.\n\nLindsey Graham\n\nDate: June 29, 1995\n\nHeadline: \u201cHouse Easily Passes Amendment to Ban Desecration of Flag\u201d\n\nMention: \"\u2018If you need to burn something, burn your Congressman in effigy,\u2019 Representative Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, exhorted on the House floor with the passion that typified this culturally divisive debate. \u2018But don't burn the flag.\u2019\u201d\n\nContext: The freshman congressman\u2019s first quote in the Times was from a debate on an ultimately unsuccessful effort to pass a constitutional amendment banning flag burning.

{"entityId": 284, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201can immediate end to police brutality and murder of black people\u201d was No. 7 on the Black Panther Party\u2019s 10-point declaration of its program , and deaths of black people at the hands of police in California served as catalyzing events for Panther actions in the area. Panthers also confronted law enforcement directly , \u201cpolicing the police\u201d by patrolling Oakland neighborhoods with guns. Calls today for citizens to videotape police stops share some DNA with this kind of direct action.\n\nThe abuse of power by local authorities was a constant theme in the civil rights movement, most notably in Birmingham (where Bull Connor not only deployed firehoses and German shepherds against protestors, but in echoes of Ferguson PD's militarization, drove around town in a white military assault vehicle) and Selma (where Sheriff Jim Clark wore a military helmet, an Eisenhower style army jacket and a little lapel pin that said NEVER!).\n\nWhile segregation and disenfranchisement are often understood as the primary targets of the \u201950s- and \u201960s-era civil rights protesters, historians note that policing and criminal justice\u2014the animating issues in our own time\u2014were concerns for those activists as well. Brian Goldstein, an urban historian at the University of New Mexico, pointed to the \u201cHarlem Riot\u201d of 1943 , which occurred when a black soldier attempted to stop a white policeman from arresting a black woman, after which the policeman shot him. During the iconic civil rights years, the way the movement was policed was a serious issue, as Kevin Kruse, a historian at Princeton, wrote in an email:\n\nThe midcentury activists may look admirably precocious in hindsight, but at the time they seemed dangerous. Theoharis, a professor of political science at Brooklyn College, pointed to the 1951 high school strike led by 16-year-old Barbara Johns , which prompted the lawsuit that was reviewed along with four other cases in Brown v. Board. \u201cIf we think about the demonstrations in Birmingham in the spring of 1963, it\u2019s young people; if you think about high school walkouts in the late 1960s from L.A. to New York; if you think about things like the Young Lords party here in New York City \u2026 we\u2019re talking about very young people,\u201d Theoharis added in a conversation over the phone. \u201cThat made our society nervous 50\u201360 years ago, and it makes our society nervous today.\u201d\n\nLet\u2019s start, though, with the period we\u2019ve traditionally thought of as the civil rights era, stretching from the late 1950s to the mid-to-late 1960s. The historians I spoke with pointed out significant similarities between this time and the new activism of our day that haven\u2019t received much notice. First: the youth of the movements\u2019 leaders. Martin Luther King, Jr. was 26 at the time of the Montgomery Bus Boycott, and many civil rights activists of that period, like the members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee , were in college. Stefan Bradley, a historian at St. Louis University who has written about black student activism of the late 1960s and teaches present-day student activists, said in an email to me \u201cThe youth made the struggle work back then, and the youth are the driving force of the struggle now.\u201d\n\nThis is very much still an active debate , but when I asked historians if the protests of the present remind them of protests of the past, they answered with this more complex, evolving portrait of the civil rights movement in mind. Many of them welcomed the question not only because they do believe that history informs our understanding of what\u2019s happening today, but also because they hope that the public\u2019s thirst for historical context might occasion a reconsideration of a civil rights movement whose popular history has become reverent hagiography. This is a moment, they said, to reassess who its leaders were; what issues it addressed; what tactics it used; and the length and breadth of its trajectory.\n\nThe answer to these questions, it turns out, depends a lot on what you mean when you say civil rights era. Since the publication of an influential book by Jeanne Theoharis and Komozi Woodard in 2003 and a much-cited article by Jacquelyn Dowd Hall in 2005, historians have argued over the parameters of civil rights history. In popular memory, the civil rights movement stretched roughly from the bus boycotts in the mid-1950s to the assassination of Martin Luther King, in 1968. But some historians argue that it in fact began earlier and lasted longer than we usually think, running roughly from the 1930s through 1980. (Still others contend that the movement stretches all the way back to late-19 th \u2013 and early-20 th \u2013century struggles against lynching and Jim Crow, or even 18 th - and 19 th -century slave revolts and resistance.) The historians I talked to also stressed that it\u2019s important not to define civil rights activism too narrowly: It would be a mistake to consider only the boycotts and marches that have come to symbolize the midcentury movement. The activism of the \u201clong movement,\u201d they say, should be remembered as tactically diverse: Not everyone believed in nonviolent protest, and armed groups worked alongside nonviolent activists , even before the founding of the Black Panthers in 1966. The \u201clong movement\u201d was also more nationally dispersed\u2014there were local actions in the North and West, as well as the South\u2014than we usually remember.\n\nParallels like these are striking, but how much do they help us understand the roots and direction of today\u2019s activism? I contacted a group of historians of the civil rights movement to find out whether they too see a resemblance between the past and present\u2014and whether those resemblances suggest we\u2019re at the dawn of a new civil rights era.\n\nThe year since Ferguson has been full of echoes of the midcentury civil rights movement. The Montgomery Bus Boycott started three months after the 1955 lynching of 14-year-old Emmett Till; Michael Brown\u2019s death in Ferguson served as a catalyst for Black Lives Matter activists. Network television\u2019s widespread coverage of the civil rights movement of the 1960s mobilized national interest in the struggle against the racist institutions of the South, shocking white viewers with footage from Birmingham and Selma; in 2014 and 2015, the proliferation of smartphones, dashcams, and body cameras has yielded footage of encounters with police that has won national attention for what previously might have been overlooked stories of police brutality .\n\nPhoto by William Lovelace/Express/Getty Images\n\nMany historians now consider the nonviolent activism of Martin Luther King and the more radical platforms of groups like the Panthers to be intertwined strands of the same movement. But the figure of King casts a particularly long shadow over today\u2019s activism. The sainted caricature of the civil rights leader\u2014Theoharis called the present-day memory of King a \u201cThanksgiving Day parade balloon,\u201d one that ignores the leader\u2019s persistence and radicalism\u2014has been held up as an example to discipline contemporary activists, some of whom have been castigated for being insufficiently \u201ccalm\u201d or \u201corderly.\u201d Goldstein pointed out the \u201cbrave and confrontational stances and approaches\u201d of some of today\u2019s activists\u2014like Bree Newsome, who scaled the flagpole at the South Carolina statehouse and removed the Confederate banner flying there\u2014have come under fire from those who would prefer a less antagonistic approach. Even as some applaud actions like Newsome\u2019s, Goldstein said, \u201cI have also seen an uptick in hand-wringing responses to some of these events, from the position that confrontation is the \u2018wrong\u2019 way to engage or even some claiming that just as Black Power ended the Civil Rights Movement, this will end an incipient movement.\u201d\n\nBradley added that this unfavorable comparison between nonviolent activists of the past and present-day Black Lives Matter protesters ignores the many phases of historical civil rights movements that weren\u2019t particularly religious, nonviolent, or self-consciously \u201crespectable\u201d: \u201cBy the end of the 1960s, many young people were rejecting the ideas of respectability and messianic leadership that largely black middle class clergy espoused for those in the movement.\u201d\n\nHolding today\u2019s activists up to King\u2019s standard also reinforces the misconception that King was the solitary leader of the midcentury movement. Observers of Black Lives Matter have bemoaned the lack of a figure to play the role of King; in January, for example, Oprah Winfrey told People magazine, in an interview pegged to the release of the movie Selma, that she thought the new movement lacked leadership. University of Illinois at Chicago historian Barbara Ransby replied in Colorlines that Winfrey and others looking to name the \u201cnew Martin Luther King\u201d forget that King was hardly the only civil rights leader, nor were his methods the only ones successfully wielded to effect change.\n\nPhoto by Express Newspapers/Getty Images\n\nRansby has written extensively on the midcentury activist Ella Baker, who worked with the NAACP, SNCC, and King\u2019s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Baker famously said that \u201cstrong people don\u2019t need strong leaders,\u201d but Ransby writes that the activist wasn\u2019t against leadership, per se. Rather, she favored a distributed structure that would empower many people, instead of relying on a few charismatic figureheads. In other words, Baker envisioned the kind of movement that Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors (who is a director at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights) has called \u201cleader-full\u201d rather than \u201cleaderless.\u201d Ransby points out that in the 1960s and 1970s, the SNCC and the Black Panther Party both pursued this model as well, looking to create strong groups of linked activists who operated from consensus.\n\nThe prominence of women and queer activists in the Black Lives Matter movement\u2014a contrast with the largely male-dominated leadership we tend to imagine when we think of the midcentury movement\u2014is an evolution that many historians I contacted noted, and applauded. They also suggested that the pre-eminence of women has contributed to the perception that the movement \u201chas no leader.\u201d \u201cWe have a lot of leaders,\u201d one of Cullors\u2019 co-founders, Alicia Garza, told the Guardian last month, \u201cjust not where you might be looking for them. If you\u2019re only looking for the straight black man who is a preacher, you\u2019re not going to find it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a coincidence that a movement that brings together the talents of black women\u2014many of them queer\u2014for the purpose of liberation is considered leaderless, since black women have so often been rendered invisible,\u201d Marcia Chatelain, a historian at Georgetown, said in an interview with Dissent. \u201cThe most damaging impact of the sanitized and oversimplified version of the civil rights story is that it has convinced many people that single, charismatic male leaders are a prerequisite for social movements.\u201d\n\n* * *\n\nOne of the biggest problems with making comparisons between post-Ferguson activism and the midcentury movement is that it encourages us to skip over the 50 intervening years\u2014as if no civil rights struggle, or progress, was made after the tumult of the 1960s. \u201cIn the popular imagination, King was assassinated in 1968, and maybe some people remember the Black Panthers or something, but after that, in the \u201970s, \u201980s, and \u201990s, it\u2019s a blur in terms of civil rights, a feeling that nothing happened,\u201d Jason Sokol, a historian at the University of New Hampshire who has written about the evolution of racial politics in the North over the past half-century, said in a phone interview.

The lead-up to the Fox News event has been chockfull of what-will-Trump-do speculation, the most interesting of which suggested that the current GOP frontrunner will shake things up by doing the most un-Trump-like thing imaginable: Playing nice.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe idea was originally floated by advisers to several of The Donald\u2019s rivals\u2014perhaps hoping that saying so aloud would make it true\u2014and since echoed by Trump himself in recent days. Underlying his promise of civility, though, has been a constant reminder that the professional showman doesn\u2019t suffer slights in silence. \u201cI\u2019d prefer no conflict, no infighting,\u201d he told the Washington Post this week, \u201cbut if they hit me, I\u2019ll hit them harder.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe message for the GOP field was simple: Don\u2019t poke the bizarrely coiffed bear and you won't run the risk of being eaten alive by it on primetime television. That advice, though, might not be of much help when someone else does the poking for you. Here's what the main headline on the Drudge Report looks like about eight hours before the debate curtain goes up:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the passage in question from the linked-Politico piece, \u201cHow Jeb and the GOP Got Trumped\u201d:\n\n\u201cSeriously, what\u2019s this guy\u2019s problem?\u201d [Bush] asked one party donor he ran into recently, according to accounts provided by several sources close to Bush\u2014and he went on to describe the publicity-seeking real estate developer now surging in public polls far ahead of Bush and all the 15 others in the Republican field as \u201ca buffoon,\u201d \u201cclown\u201d and \u201casshole.\u201d\n\nAs you can tell, those quotes came second-hand, though that distinction might not mean a whole lot to Trump, who's spent the past month absorbing punches and responding with shotgun blasts.

What was most interesting about that speech\u2014and the session that followed\u2014is that the president\u2019s primary aim is to stiffen the arguments and energize the activism of the deal\u2019s supporters, with a secondary goal of nudging the neutral and undecided into the column of supporters. One thing he\u2019s no longer trying to do is to convert the opponents, who, locked by justifiable anxieties or irredeemable biases, have shown that they\u2019re unswayable by logic and uninterested in the facts.\n\nAt the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner in April, Obama said that, after the midterms, people asked him whether he had a bucket list. \u201cWell,\u201d he recalled replying, \u201cI have something that rhymes with bucket list \u2026\u201d To illustrate the point, he said, \u201cTake executive action on immigration? Bucket! New regulations? Bucket!\u201d And now, he seems to be jotting a new item on the list: Iran nuclear deal? Bucket!\n\nHe can\u2019t do this one entirely on his own. Though the deal is not legally a treaty (but rather a seven-nation political arrangement, backed by a U.N. Security Council Resolution), members of Congress did insist on a role for themselves, allowing 60 days from the deal\u2019s signing to vote on it, up or down. The House and Senate, both controlled by Republicans, are likely to vote it down; but Obama has said he\u2019d veto that motion\u2014and few believe the GOP can muster the two-thirds majority needed to override the veto.\n\nThat\u2019s the task, then, that Obama has placed before him in Washington\u2019s polarized politics\u2014hanging on to enough Democrats to sustain the veto. \u201cIf I presented a cure for cancer, getting legislation passed to move that forward would be a nail-biter,\u201d he said at the session with columnists. \u201cSo my main concern is simply to be able to implement the deal \u2026 I\u2019m less concerned about the point spread.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I presented a cure for cancer, getting legislation passed to move that forward would be a nail-biter.\u201d\n\nAt that session, he elaborated on the argument that has most riled his critics\u2014that the only ways to keep Iran from getting a nuclear weapon are to approve the deal or eventually go to war. Critics have denounced this claim as unfair fearmongering. But Obama told the columnists that he was only laying out \u201cthe dictates of cold, hard logic.\u201d\n\nThe logic is this: Iran was driven to the negotiating table by the pain of international sanctions; European and Asian leaders agreed to impose sanctions, at considerable economic cost to themselves, only after being persuaded that doing so might lead to a deal that stopped Iran from building a bomb; we now have that deal. Those who want Congress to reject it seem to believe that our diplomatic partners will follow us in reimposing the sanctions and forcing Iran to accept a \u201cbetter\u201d deal. In fact, Obama rightly said, this is \u201cfantasy.\u201d\n\nInstead, if Congress rejects the deal, the sanctions will collapse, and Iran will resume its nuclear program\u2014rather than halting, slashing, and subjecting it to international inspectors, as the deal would have required. Then, at some point, Obama predicted, \u201csome of the same voices who were opposed to the deal would insist that the only way to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon is to take strikes. And it will be framed as limited military strikes, and it will be suggested that Iran will not respond, but we will have entered into a war.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:50:10.799+0000"}

For the past two days, the former Florida governor has been trying to clean up the wreckage from his comment that \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need a half a billion dollars for women\u2019s health issues.\u201d Bush posted a statement on his website an hour after he questioned the funding of women\u2019s health programs saying that he misspoke and meant only to question the $500 million in federal funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBush has had to revise and extend his remarks a few times already in this campaign, most notably regarding his views on the Iraq war, workers\u2019 hours, and Medicare. It would be tempting to say he shares his brother\u2019s and father\u2019s misadventures in public speech, but these are not idiosyncratic malapropisms or miscues. Bush is his own man (as he has told us). He\u2019s just shanking the ball in his own particular way. The candidate\u2019s repeated troubles along these lines are the rap against him, the most consistent thing Republican lawmakers, voters, and political hacks talk about when assessing his campaign.\n\nFor Bush, the first Republican debate will be a welcome relief from the one he has been having with himself.\n\nBush is playing the long game, his aides say. These momentary episodes don\u2019t mean a thing in the scope of a campaign. The things his team is working on\u2014money, organization, and winning delegates to get nominated\u2014are the most important. They\u2019re probably right. These Jeb-in-the-rabbit-hole moments are mostly \u201cyou didn\u2019t build that\u201d episodes, where the candidate shorthands something or misstates it altogether and his opponents seize on it, the way Republicans leapt on President Obama\u2019s comments about business in 2012. (The exception is Bush\u2019s comments about the Iraq war, where he didn\u2019t demonstrate a lot of thought about the invasion\u2019s legacy.)\n\nBut at some point Bush must show skill in the service of his larger campaign argument. The debate would be a good, high-profile moment to do that. To some, it looks like Bush enters the debate on his heels, but the first contest on the stage offers a huge opportunity: a chance to expel a problem in the time period closest to its reappearance.\n\nBush is never going to get on the right side of his stumbles by articulating what he really meant to say. (It's not clear any politician can in the modern era.) Plus, when Bush is arguing on women\u2019s health ground, he\u2019s playing on the turf where voters most trust Democrats. But a strong performance in a debate, where everyone is watching, would ease some doubts about whether Bush can inhabit the general election posture his campaign is founded on.\n\nBush\u2019s pitch is that he is the adult in the room, the candidate who can go the distance against the likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. He\u2019s also arguing that he can attract a new kind of voter for Republicans, and he\u2019s promising to lift voters with his sense of optimism. All of these claims require that he move with speed and skill in future combat.\n\nOther Republican candidates are offering something very different. They are arguing that they can win in the general election by growing the conservative vote by being pure conservatives. Despite campaign stumbles, they can still point to their conservative credentials. Bush is making a case that he can steal part of the electorate from Democrats\u2014a more ambitious gamble that requires finesse. He can\u2019t just assert he\u2019s going to do it. He has to show he can do it (as writing teachers everywhere remind their students).\n\nWhat was problematic about Bush\u2019s recent stumble was not just that it was an unforced error\u2014a comment made in a formal setting and not some gaffe in response to a gotcha question\u2014and not just that it showed him rusty in the cut and thrust of the modern campaign, but that he handed his likely opponent an opportunity. \u201cHe\u2019s got no problem giving billions of dollars away to super wealthy and powerful corporations,\u201d Hillary Clinton said, \u201cbut I guess women\u2019s health just isn\u2019t a priority for him.\u201d Clinton didn\u2019t just jump on Bush\u2019s remarks because she disagreed with them. She used them as a ladder out of her current problems. The message she was sending Democrats\u2014particularly female voters\u2014is that she will be a fast-acting fighter for them.

Photos by Getty and Reuters.\n\nMany moments from Stewart\u2019s Daily Show have already become cultural touchstones: his 9/11 monologue, his Jim Cramer smackdown, his rants about New York pizza. But which segments best capture the exact atmosphere and attitude of this Daily Show? As his time as host winds down on Thursday night, Slate staffers recall the most Stewart-esque moments from the past decade and a half. (There\u2019s a reason so many of these moments are from 2004: If any political year felt custom-built for the Jon Stewart treatment, that was it.)\n\nPlaying straight man to Produce Pete, March 2003:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSome of the greatest Stewart-era Daily Show correspondent bits were the \u201cProduce Pete\u201d segments in which Steve Carell played a local-newsish fruit-and-vegetable enthusiast whose segments inevitably culminated in his revealing some disturbing fact about his life as a deeply unhappy, divorced alcoholic who was unpopular with his co-workers. \u201cA lot of people spend their summers vacationing with their family,\u201d Produce Pete said during the segment on canning. \u201cBut I spend mine in the basement, putting things in jars!\u201d Stewart was successful at the Daily Show in some part because he was so good as a collaborator and emcee/straight man, and to me those elements of his tenure are best represented by future megastar Steve Carell, in 2003, playing an idiot grocer who is despondently describing how he plans to make borscht for a mail-order Russian bride and her two brothers. \u2013Slatest editor Ben Mathis-Lilley\n\nMaking Jennifer Love Hewitt uncomfortable, June 2004:\n\nThe first half, when Stewart and his guests do chitchat, shows how good he could be as a traditional talk-show host: quick, funny, aggressive, flirty, in control. Halfway through, the topic turns to Garfield: The Movie, the pointless 2004 live-action film Hewitt was there to promote\u2014but Stewart has no interest in helping her promote it. He suggests that Bill Murray, who provided the eponymous cat\u2019s voice, \u201cmust be some kind of crazy whore for money right now.\u201d \u201cThis has been lovely, by the way,\u201d Hewitt says near the end, with the look of a woman about to fire her publicist. \u2014Gabriel Roth, Slate senior editor\n\nSkewering Texas Republican Henry Bonilla, August 2004:\n\nIn 2004, a GOP talking point brandished against John Kerry and John Edwards was that they were the No. 1 and No. 3 most liberal members of the Senate. While it was true that Kerry was a quite liberal senator, he was never really the MOST liberal, and Edwards was far from the third most liberal, but they were judged to be so because of weird quirks in the way the scores were determined by National Journal. I reported on it while covering the 2004 campaign; I also remember getting into it during a post-debate \u201cspin room\u201d session with John Cornyn when the Texas Republican repeated this \u201cfact.\u201d Though today this all must seem like unconscionable political pettiness, then it was one of those say-it-enough-it\u2019ll-be-true charges that can never be killed. The rhetorically undead. Well, in this interview with Texas Republican Henry Bonilla, Jon Stewart takes the talking point doomed to walk the Earth, fashions it into a stake, and impales the undead. Charmingly. But relentlessly. As only Stewart could do. \u2013The Gist host Mike Pesca\n\nAlso skewering Sen. Zell Miller, September 2004:\n\nSo much was farcical about the 2004 Bush-Kerry race, otherwise known as \u201cIndecision 2004\u201d\u2014Kerry\u2019s wind surfing, Bush\u2019s words, and the way an election in midst of a disastrous war that we went into on false pretenses got turned into a referendum on Kerry\u2019s Vietnam record. It was all perfect Daily Show fodder. Perhaps the most ridiculous moment of many, though, came after Democratic Sen. Zell Miller delivered a ferocious attack on Kerry during the Republican National Convention\u2019s keynote speech. What happened next was an unhinged rant for the ages, one that seemed like it was designed to be taken down by Stewart\u2019s trademark over-the-top impressions, razor wit, and perfect chyron puns. \u2014Slate senior editor Jeremy Stahl\n\nSquaring off with Chris Matthews, September 2004:\n\nThe relationship between Jon Stewart and Chris Matthews wasn\u2019t always so contentious\u2014just look at this 2004 clip in which the two (mostly) commiserated about politicians being too afraid to answer actual questions. But a few years later, Matthews came on the show to promote his book Life\u2019s a Campaign, and the spirit was considerably less friendly, as Stewart challenged what he deemed as the Hardball host\u2019s \u201crecipe for sadness.\u201d The highlight: When an exasperated Matthews deems the moment \u201cthe worst interview I\u2019ve ever had in my life,\u201d as a nonplussed Stewart tries his best not to burst out laughing. It\u2019s Stewart doing one of the things he does best\u2014coolly and confidently winning an argument against an over-worked, bumbling guest. \u2014Aisha Harris, Slate staff writer\n\nWelcoming Steve Carell back to the show, August 2005:\n\nIn 2005, Carell returned as a guest to promote his first big movie, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. For the first few minutes of the interview, they sit in uncomfortable, theatrically awkward silence. Theatrically awkward happens to be one of the modes Carell works in best. But the best part is how well it showcases their rapport\u2014it\u2019s like watching two former bandmates sit down to play and realizing they still know the old songs. It\u2019s funny and charming moment, even a little sweet. And it\u2019s a great reminder of Stewart knack\u2019s for cultivating, and then catapulting, talented comedians. \u2014Panoply Web developer Paul Smith\n\nOn the media\u2019s weird Sarah Palin coverage, September 2008:\n\nSure, Stewart\u2019s roll-clip-and-roll-eyes routine came to feel like a tic over time. But still: his Daily Show really did master the art of the media mashup\u2014using deft cuts and curation to force talking heads to neatly debunk themselves. Not only does this 2008 segment on the media\u2019s early coverage of Sarah Palin memorably describe as Karl Rove as \u201can analyst with a head like a lump of unbaked bread dough,\u201d it also captures Stewart\u2019s exact brand of cable-news parasitism. Here, with little more than some prime mugging and chin-stroking, Stewart takes apart a Rove rant about Palin and allows Bill O\u2019Reilly to demonstrate his own inconsistent views regarding pregnant teens. The fact that it all feels, at this point, like boilerplate Stewart is why this clip is a classic. \u2014Slate senior editor Laura Bennett\n\n\u201cJezebel thinks I\u2019m a sexist prick,\u201d June 2010:\n\nStewart will be remembered as the face of progressivism in the early 2000s. And early 2000s progressivism looks pretty good! It\u2019s funny, reliable, passionate, self-deprecating, white, male, and super super defensive about those last two things. Jon Stewart may be wittier and hotter and way more successful than the average brogressive, but when his commitment to race or gender equality are questioned, he reacts just as weirdly as any liberal Twitter rando. Former Daily Show writer Wyatt Cenac recently recounted what happened when Cenac, the only black writer in the room, advised Stewart against doubling down on a Herman Cain impression some saw as racist: Stewart allegedly stood up at the table and screamed obscenities at him. When the writer Alison Kinney attended a taping of The Daily Show in 2008 and asked Stewart in an open Q-and-A why his warm-up comic made ethnic jokes targeted at members of the crowd, she says he screamed and swore at her, too. This 2010 clip is classic Stewart, at his best and worst: In the middle of a delicious rant about the latest unhinged conservative talking point, Stewart veers off into a self-reflective fantasy, drops in a trite acknowledgment of a recent Jezebel report questioning the status of women on the show\u2014\u201cJezebel thinks I\u2019m a sexist prick!\u201d\u2014then returns to his regularly scheduled programming. A self-pitying throwaway joke in a fantasy sequence is as close as Stewart ever came to acknowledging the critics on the left. \u2014Slate staff writer Amanda Hess\n\nOn the government \u201cShutstorm,\u201d October 2013:\n\nStewart\u2019s particular satirical formula is especially potent when aimed at hypocrisy, which was in ample supply during the two-week-long government shutdown of 2013\u2014particularly in the bit that starts around 3:05 here. Exhibit A: Rep. Tim Walberg\u2014a Republican from Michigan who called for the shutdown and later voted against ending it\u2014bemoaning from the House floor the interruption of federal services. It seems Walberg was put out by the shuttering of the Panda Cam at the National Zoo.

At least that appears to be the case with an Arizona Republican whom Trump\u2019s team tried and failed to distance itself from Tuesday night, in the wake of revelations of the politico\u2019s racially charged social media past.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nWhen BuzzFeed asked Trump\u2019s campaign about Aaron Borders, a spokeswoman for The Donald originally denied the campaign had any official connection with the man. \u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Aaron, but he appears to be an overzealous volunteer,\u201d said Hope Hicks. The problem with that statement, though, is that Borders provided BuzzFeed with phone recordings of Trump\u2019s campaign manager asking him to draw up a primary plan for Arizona, and expressing intent to hire him. \u201cYou help on that. Then we say, \u2018Hey dude, you\u2019re the guy, you know what to do, let\u2019s start moving forward on it,\u2019 right?\u201d campaign manager Corey Lewandowski tells Borders in the recording.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBorders not only did what he was asked; he also says he was in Ohio on Tuesday to help the campaign finalize its budget and to sign his contract. A paid job, however, never came\u2014something both sides agree on and a detail that the Trump campaign is using to try to shrug off its original spin job. In a follow-up email to BuzzFeed, Hicks offered a more delicate denial: \u201cAaron Borders is not and has never been employed by the Donald J. Trump for President campaign.\u201d\n\nThat may be technically true, but the recordings strongly suggest that the original don\u2019t-know-him response from the campaign was a blatant attempt to manipulate the press and make the story go away. When Lewandowski called to tell Borders that they were parting ways to avoid any fallout from his Facebook page\u2014which compared President Obama to Adolf Hitler and Osama Bin Laden, and suggested that Obama was only elected because he was black, among other unsavory things\u2014Trump\u2019s campaign manager offered this doozy of a quote (emphasis mine), which will look familiar: \u201cWe\u2019ll just tell BuzzFeed that there\u2019s no formal relationship, that you\u2019re an overzealous volunteer, and that you\u2019re not part of the campaign in any way shape or form, regardless of what the story says.\u201d (Anyone still willing to give Lewandowski the benefit of the doubt should head on over to BuzzFeed and listen to him tell Borders he will \u201csue [his] fucking ass to next year,\u201d and then read his on-the-record denial he ever said anything like that.)\n\nThe dispute over Borders comes only days after the campaign fired adviser Sam Nunberg after Business Insider discovered a number of old racist posts on his Facebook account. \u201cEffective immediately, low level part-time consultant, Sam Nunberg is no longer associated with the Donald J. Trump for President campaign,\u201d Lewandowski told the New York Times in a statement on Sunday.\n\nThe Borders mess is another reminder of the aggressively nasty way Team Trump does business. But the bigger question is: Why would Trump pass up the chance to deploy his trademark catchphrase and publicly part ways with an intolerant guy who, at the very least, had been in repeated contact with Trump\u2019s campaign and helped organize a high-profile rally in Arizona this summer?\n\nThe Donald\u2019s decision not to take that path highlights an inherent awkwardness in his intentionally politically incorrect campaign. Trump prides himself on his ability to say what he wants without a filter, even when those comments are bigoted or xenophobic. This is a guy, after all, who launched his campaign with a rambling rant about Mexicans being rapists and murderers. Four years ago, he was beating the birther drum more loudly than anyone. Flash-forward to today, and he\u2019s still unwilling to concede that President Obama is American-born. Given his own track record, then, Trump would have had a difficult time saying exactly what it is that Borders did that was unacceptable to him\u2014easier to say that he was never hired than to explain why he was fired and risk undercutting that same no-apologies brand of belligerence that his supporters love so much.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, after all, that Borders said that he didn\u2019t \u201cthink twice about being candid\u201d on Facebook given the way the man he wanted to be president conducts himself. \u201cI thought, you know, this is the kind of guy that I, you know, he\u2019s not PC,\u201d Borders told BuzzFeed. \u201cNeither am I, you know.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:50:48.956+0000"}

I\u2019m unequivocal on this,\u201d the president said at a joint press conference with Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta.\n\nObama\u2019s statement was pretty bold, especially for a man who needed four years in office, and a second bid at the gig, to come out publicly in support of marriage equality in his own country. But while the Obama administration has become the new champion of international gay rights, a very different kind of American export is having a more profound and deeply detrimental effect. If Obama really wants to make a difference abroad, he should look a little closer to home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe president has spent a couple of high-profile days in Africa. But, as researcher Kapya Kaoma points out, powerful, rich Christian groups have spent years cultivating exactly the kind of sentiment that the president is opposing. Kaoma is an Anglican priest from Zambia who now lives and works in the United States. Since 2008, he\u2019s been researching, as he puts it, \u201chow American right-wing evangelical groups have unceasingly attacked and undermined LGBTQI rights and reproductive justice in the name of Christianity.\u201d\n\nThe evidence is widespread. Most well-publicized is the case of Uganda, where American megachurches like the International House of Prayer have spent millions cultivating huge followings and pushing an explicitly anti-gay agenda. This is coupled with the influence of charismatic church leaders like Scott Lively: According to filmmaker Roger Ross Williams (who tells much of this story in his incredible documentary God Loves Uganda), Lively was allowed to \u201caddress the [Ugandan] parliament for five hours, and his hate-filled message led directly to the anti-homosexuality bill.\u201d Remember that bill? The one that, before it was toned down, would have imposed the death penalty on queers? Yeah, that one.\n\nIn South Sudan, the story is pretty similar. There, the American Centre for Law and Justice did their best to get homophobia written into the fledgling country\u2019s constitution. In 2011, they met with South Sudan\u2019s president before the country was officially independent to discuss \u201ca full rewrite of South Sudan\u2019s constitution.\u201d\n\nIn Kenya, the ACLJ has been actively campaigning against gay rights for years. According to Mother Jones, \u201c[in 2010] ACLJ's African offices went to work ensuring that constitutional reforms in Zimbabwe and Kenya enshrined Christian positions such as outlawing abortion and homosexuality.\u201d Although they didn't succeed in permanently etching homophobia into the Kenyan constitution, the ACLJ promised to \u201ccarry out further civic education to warn people of the dangers of homosexuality and abortion in Kenya.\u201d Apparently it\u2019s working\u2014a 2013 Pew study found that 90 percent of Kenyans thought homosexuality shouldn\u2019t be accepted by society. Little wonder that President Kenyatta wasn\u2019t having it regarding Obama\u2019s statement: In Kenya, he said, \u201cgay rights is really a non-issue.\u201d\n\n(And if you had any doubt about how powerful the ACLJ is, Jeb Bush recently appointed its founder and head homophobe, Jordan Sekulow, as his \u201cliaison\u201d with religious conservatives. Ready for 2016 yet?)\n\nUnfortunately, this evangelical colonialism is not just a problem in Africa. American Christian groups are more ambitious globetrotters than Carmen Sandiego. The Alliance Defending Freedom is another multi-million-dollar Christian group that's been behind almost every religious freedom bill and marriage equality ban nationwide. Thwarted at home, the ADF has gone south: A recent report from Political Research Associates describes how the ADF has developed \u201ca keen interest in Latin America,\u201d supporting conservative and often homophobic legal action from Costa Rica to Chile.\n\nThese right-wing zealots have realized that they\u2019ve lost the war stateside. So instead of waving the white flag, groups like the ADF and ACLJ have taken their agenda elsewhere, to countries where their values are easy to sell\u2014especially when packaged with millions of dollars in development aid. To countries from Russia to Zimbabwe where they can support corrupt leaders in making scapegoats of queers and other minorities in order to distract from the dirty politics going on behind closed doors.\n\nThis week, Uganda will be celebrating Pride. Last year, the parade had a special significance because the \"Kill the Gays\" bill, which American evangelicals helped enact, had just been struck down. This year, the parade promises to be bigger than ever. But still, the event is also a reminder of the long, hard struggle activists have faced against the power of American evangelism.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:51:02.427+0000"}
{"entityId": 295, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nPresident Obama continued his ongoing sales pitch for the Iran nuclear agreement today with a speech at American University that took sharp aim at critics of the deal in Congress and invoked the legacy of Cold War nuclear diplomacy. \u201cI\u2019ve had to make a lot of tough calls as president, but whether or not this deal is good for U.S. national security is not one of those calls. It\u2019s not even close,\u201d he said.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nSome of the speech was devoted to deflecting criticism of what Obama called \u201cthe strongest nonproliferation agreement ever negotiated,\u201d including complaints about the inspections system that will be put in place, the amount of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure that will remain, and whether sanctions relief will allow Iran to increase its support for terrorism. The president acknowledged that some of the money Iran receives would go towards that support, but said that Iran would fund these groups regardless and that the majority of the relief would have to go toward pressing domestic economic needs that \u201ceven a repressive regime like Iran cannot entirely ignore.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut as I wrote last week, the argument over the deal is less about its specifics than about whether a diplomatic resolution to the nuclear standoff with Iran is even possible, and that\u2019s where Obama devoted most of his attention, saying, \u201cAn argument against sanctions relief is an argument against any diplomatic solution to this issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not mince words,\u201d he said, \u201cthe choice we face is ultimately between diplomacy and some form of war.\u201d He argued that if Congress were to reject the agreement, the international sanctions regime against Iran would unravel, meaning the regime would get relief from other countries without having to make any concessions. \u201cThose who say we can just walk away from this deal and maintain sanctions are selling a fantasy,\u201d he said. Perhaps anticipating the withering criticism he\u2019s sure to receive at tomorrow\u2019s Republican debate, Obama disparaged \u201cvague promises of toughness\u201d and said that those who believe Iran can be pressured into complete submission are \u201ceither ignorant of Iranian society or they\u2019re not being straight with the American people.\u201d\n\nThe president also said that Iranian hardliners are \u201cmaking common cause with the Republican caucus\u201d in opposition to the deal and said that many of those criticizing the deal are the same who pushed for the 2003 war in Iraq and \u201cseem to have no compunction with being repeatedly wrong.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama emphasized the international support for the deal, he also called out Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, saying, \u201cI do not doubt his sincerity, but I believe he is wrong.\u201d Claiming to have done \u201cmore than any other president to strengthen Israel\u2019s security,\u201d Obama argued that Israel has the capability to meet any conventional military threat. He also made the case that despite the prime minister\u2019s objections, the deal is the best way to prevent an Iranian nuclear weapon that would pose a much more dire threat to the Jewish state. (That argument is unikely to convince Netanyahu.)\n\nThe location of the speech was deliberately chosen by the White House to evoke John F. Kennedy\u2019s 1963 commencement address, which made the case for the negotiations that would eventually the Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union. Returning to an argument he made in an interview with Jon Stewart, Obama pointed out that \u201cthe agreements pursued by Kennedy and Reagan with the Soviet Union involved America accepting significant constraints on our arsenal. As such they were riskier. This agreement involves no such constraints.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:51:09.683+0000"}

This is the first time since the launch of his presidential campaign that his functional bilingualism has been on full display.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo how did he do? Here is the assessment of National Journal's Alexia Fern\u00e1ndez Campbell (\"How Well Does Jeb Bush Habla Espa\u00f1ol?\"):\n\nIt's clear that the Republican presidential candidate speaks Spanish fluently (with a gringo accent, of course). During the sit-down interview, Bush discussed immigration reform, Cuban foreign policy, and the Puerto Rican debt crisis with only a handful of minor word-gender mistakes.\n\nBush, who is married to a Mexican woman and who has been embraced by Miami's Cuban exile community, kept his Spanish mostly neutral during the chat. You could only hear a slight trace of Miami in his accent, when he dropped the last \"s\" in some of his words. He did refer to himself as a ni\u00f1o popis when he met his wife, Columba, during a high school trip to central Mexico. That's Mexican slang for \"spoiled boy.\"\n\nIf Jeb made it to the White House, he would be the first bilingual U.S. president in 70 years. The last one was FDR, who spoke French and German fluently. Past presidents have brushed up on their Spanish, knowing how important it is to reach Latino voters. But few, including President Obama, can really say much.\n\nWhile Obama doesn't speak much Spanish, his Indonesian skills are not half bad, considering he hasn't lived in Indonesia since he was 10 years old. (See my series of Language Log posts here, here, here, and here.)\n\nNow, could Obama have made it through a 20-minute Indonesian-only interview as Jeb Bush did in Spanish? I suspect not. The closest he came was a March 2010 White House interview with a correspondent from Indonesia's RCTI.\n\nBefore the interview proper begins, Obama gives a brief Indonesian response to the question of whether he can speak the language. He says, \"Masih bisa omong sedikit,\" or \"I still can speak a little,\" before returning to English (\"I used to be fluent, but I don't get a chance to practice\"). Then, at the beginning of the formal interview, he exchanges pleasantries, responding to \"Apa kabar?\" (\"How are you?\") with \"Baik-baik, terima kasih\" (\"I'm fine, thank you\"). Again he is asked about his Indonesian proficiency: \"Masih bisa bahasa Indonesia?\" (\"Can you still speak Indonesian?\"). Obama says in idiomatic Indonesian, \"Masih bisa sedikit, sudah lupa banyak tapi\" (\"I still can [speak] a little, but I've forgotten a lot\") and continues in English. Then, at the very end, he tells the interviewer, \"Terima kasih, selamat jalan\" (\"Thank you, goodbye\").\n\nAs to whether FDR could have held a wide-ranging interview in French or German, or Herbert Hoover in Mandarin Chinese, I cannot say. But I bet Martin Van Buren could have done quite well in Dutch.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:51:10.122+0000"}
{"entityId": 297, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nJust a few months after stumbling around for a hindsight position on the Iraq war, Jeb Bush on Tuesday found a second war he\u2019s having trouble staying clear of on the campaign trail.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nDuring an appearance at the Southern Baptist Convention on Tuesday, the Republican hopeful was discussing how he would defund Planned Parenthood when he offered up a casual\u2014yet potentially costly\u2014aside. \u201cI\u2019m not sure we need half a billion dollars for women\u2019s issues,\u201d the former Florida governor said. The first blow came, fittingly, from Hillary Clinton, whose campaign took direct aim at Bush on Twitter: \u201cYou are absolutely, unequivocally wrong.\u201d Clinton\u2019s fellow Democrats quickly piled on. Bush\u2019s team later issued a statement saying he had \u201cmisspoke,\u201d but for a party hoping to avoid the same war-on-women narrative that hurt it in the 2012 election, the damage had already been done.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe potential for the stray comment to hurt Bush in the long term is obvious: The remarks\u2014which were captured on video and preserved on YouTube\u2014were pretty much tailor-made for a general-election attack ad. They aren\u2019t as meme-worthy as Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cbinders full of women,\u201d but liberals won\u2019t have to get nearly as creative to give them some staying power.\n\nThe comment wasn\u2019t about some niche demographic, either. The chattering class likes to talk about \u201cwomen voters\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s issues\u201d\u2014but what they\u2019re really talking about is 53 percent of the votes cast in the 2012 election. These aren\u2019t voters Democrats need to micro-target to find. And the party begins with a healthy head start: The female vote has broken in favor of the Democratic candidate in each of the past six presidential elections. In 2012, President Obama won it by 12 points over Mitt Romney. In 2008 he won it by 14 points over John McCain. Given Clinton\u2019s historic quest to become the nation\u2019s first female president, it stands to reason the gender gap will only grow in 2016. Whether the eventual GOP nominee limits those losses\u2014or exacerbates them\u2014will go a long way toward deciding his electoral fate.\n\nJeb\u2019s comments come at a particularly opportune time for Clinton given the recent talk about whether she might not be as popular among women as you\u2019d expect. In a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey from earlier this week, more women had a negative view of Clinton (45 percent) than a positive one (41 percent). Her favorability rating among white women, meanwhile, fell from 44 percent in June to 34 percent this month. Those numbers don\u2019t tell us a whole lot this early in the race, but at the very least they will prompt some handwringing in Clinton-land given that, in order to follow Obama\u2019s path to the White House, Hillary will probably need to attract more women than he did to make up for a likely lower turnout among black voters. Bush\u2019s ad-libbed comments will ease some of that worry. They\u2019re a helpful reminder that the general election isn\u2019t just about the candidate you want to vote for, it\u2019s also the one you want to vote against.\n\nIn the short term, Jeb\u2019s remarks represent a different kind of problem for his campaign. He entered the GOP nominating contest as the establishment favorite\u2014a position he still holds even as most of the attention is currently focused on Donald Trump and his outsider operation. But the case for Bush has always been more about him being solid than being stellar. So when his campaign competency takes hits, as it has several times in recent months, donors may start to worry that he\u2019s more successful at private fundraisers than in public.\n\nIn May he needed four tries over four days to answer a question his team should have seen coming from 7,000 miles away about whether, with the benefit of hindsight, he would have invaded Iraq in 2003 if he were president then instead of his brother. Two months later he provided another sound bite for the left to run with when he inelegantly said that Americans \u201cneed to work longer hours\u201d for the sake of the U.S. economy. (He later clarified he was talking about part-time workers who were looking for more work.)\n\nOn their own, these verbal stumbles won\u2019t give the GOP establishment serious second thoughts about putting Bush forward in the general election. But if Jeb adds a few more Romney-esque unforced errors to the pile\u2014say, at the debate this week or on the trail next month\u2014eventually, they might. They certainly have plenty of other options to choose from.", "score": 4, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:51:14.723+0000"}

With more than 103 of his designs issued so far, and many more that were never used, he rightly deserves the accolade of \u201cmost prolific and acclaimed stamp designer in Britain.\u201d\n\nHis first stamps were issued in 1962. However, it was in 1965, as part of an experimental project commissioned by then\u2013Postmaster General Tony Benn, that Gentleman first proposed representing the Queen\u2019s head with a simple cameo. This and other suggestions were included in what became known as the Gentleman Album, a work that outlined new themes and a new format for an exciting collection of commemorative stamps and left a lasting legacy for British stamp design.\n\nCourtesy of David Gentleman and Transport for London\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nGentleman\u2019s prolific career is not defined entirely by his stamp designs. He has also designed numerous book covers, including the extensive New Penguin Shakespeare series; posters, including several series for the National Trust; and identities, such as his British Steel logotype, which was in use for 30 years. His 330-foot mural at Charing Cross Underground Station in London is seen by millions of commuters every year.\n\nCourtesy of David Gentleman and British Steel Corporation\n\nCourtesy of David Gentleman and Transport for London\n\nGentleman\u2019s work has always had an unashamedly popular appeal\u2014his self-penned reportage books, including David Gentleman\u2019s Britain, David Gentleman\u2019s Italy, and David Gentleman\u2019s India, were all best-sellers and combined his love of travel with his expressive watercolor illustrations. Closer to home, his 2012 book, London, You\u2019re Beautiful, demonstrates his ongoing fascination with the capital with a series of drawings created over the span of a year.\n\nIt is perhaps Gentleman\u2019s fierce independence that is most impressive. He has stuck to his original intention not to teach, commute to an office, or work with anyone else. This might seem par for the course now, when all you need to be a designer is a laptop and Internet access, but in Gentleman\u2019s early career, such a stance was very unusual.\n\nPhoto by by Barry Lewis.

His 1987 book A Special Relationship was a powerful comment on the U.K.\u2019s somewhat sycophantic relationship with the U.S. under the Thatcher government, but it did not make much impact due to its book format. (Gentleman regretted not creating a series of posters instead.)\n\nHis posters and placards for the Stop the War Coalition, starting in 2003, had a much greater impact, and they played an important and very visible part in its ongoing campaign against the Iraq war.

After recounting the details of her mother\u2019s grim childhood\u2014\u201cabandoned by her parents at age 8, sent from Chicago to L.A. to live with grandparents who didn\u2019t want her\u201d\u2014Clinton explains that she\u2019s running for president so that she can help people like her mom. \u201cI think about all the Dorothys all over America,\u201d she says, as the scene switches to a shot of Clinton shaking the hand of a small, smiling girl. The closing image is a photo of Clinton and Dorothy, side by side, both in blazers, both sporting carefully coiffed bobs.\n\nEarly in the presidential election cycle, campaign ads are often gauzy. Lots of fawning biography swaddled in vague fluff. Voters are getting to know the candidates. Introductions are in order.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nUnless you\u2019re Hillary Clinton, in which case no introduction is needed. Clinton is so familiar a figure that at one moment during one of her first two ads\u2014a pair debuting on Tuesday in Iowa and New Hampshire, her first broadcast sortie of the 2016 cycle\u2014the voice-over announcer pauses amid his recap of Clinton\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9 and nods to the viewer: \u201cYou probably know the rest.\u201d\n\nIndeed we do. We know a ton about Hillary Clinton. Especially those of us who live in Iowa and New Hampshire, two early primary states that were blanketed with Clinton ads back in 2008. And yet these new Clinton spots are light on policy and heavy on character-building backstory\u2014as though Clinton were another fresh-faced newb in need of contextualization. Why is Clinton\u2019s campaign spending $2 million to fill five weeks of summer airtime with get-to-know-me ads, when everybody out there knows her already?\n\nPerhaps it\u2019s because the Clinton people already know is not a Clinton they particularly like. In the Quinnipiac University national poll released last week, 51 percent of registered voters expressed an unfavorable opinion of Clinton, versus only 40 percent favorable. A mere 37 percent felt Clinton was \u201chonest and trustworthy.\u201d (Newly buzzworthy potential rival Joe Biden was deemed honest by 58 percent of respondents.) Most worrisome of all for the candidate who fancies herself a champion of ordinary Americans: 52 percent of pollees said Clinton doesn\u2019t care about the needs and problems of people like them.\n\nThese ads were reportedly filmed before those dismal numbers came out. But they address the same, longstanding weaknesses of Clinton the candidate. She is widely respected but not widely adored. It seems she\u2019s subverted the ancient gender stereotypes: Few doubt her take-charge toughness\u201458 percent of those polled agreed she has \u201cstrong leadership qualities.\u201d But she\u2019s always had trouble when it comes to forging an emotional connection with voters.\n\nThus this reboot, with imagery that\u2019s all warm and fuzzy. We don\u2019t encounter Clinton seated behind a desk\u2014she\u2019s in a living room, with flowers and throw pillows. She isn\u2019t wearing her no-nonsense navy pantsuit\u2014she\u2019s clad in cheery jewel tones.\n\nAnd what\u2019s she talking about? Not foreign policy. Not immigration. Not even the economy (save in the most general sense). Nope, the Clinton we meet in these ads wants to chat with us about her mom.\n\n\u201cHer parents abandoned her when she was just 8 years old,\u201d Clinton tells us while we see a black-and-white photo of her mother, Dorothy, as a child. \u201cShe was mistreated,\u201d Clinton says. \u201cBut she never gave up.\u201d\n\nThe legend of the self-made person\u2014one who overcomes his bleak beginnings to find success\u2014is a beloved trope in American society. It\u2019s especially cherished by politicians, who tout humble origins as evidence of their empathy for working-class voters. Sometimes, when a candidate\u2019s own story isn\u2019t quite squalid enough, he\u2019s forced to reach back a generation or two in order to find some laudable bootstrapping. Mitt Romney, for instance, would speak from the stump about his dad\u2019s early struggles, because Romney himself grew up cosseted in wealth and privilege.\n\nClinton is pulling a similar stunt here, eliding her upbringing in an affluent Chicago suburb, and instead seizing on her mother\u2019s hard-knock narrative. But Clinton\u2019s message runs counter to the usual self-made mythology. Where Romney used his father\u2019s story as proof that poor Americans can leap ahead through their own hard work, Clinton uses Dorothy\u2019s story to illustrate the notion that it takes a village to pull on those bootstraps. It was with the help of people who \u201cshowed her kindness\u201d and \u201cgave her a chance\u201d that Dorothy climbed out of poverty. \u201cWhen she needed a champion,\u201d Clinton tells us, \u201csomeone was there.\u201d Self-reliance will get us only so far. We need someone\u2014maybe someone in the White House\u2014who\u2019ll fight for us.\n\nWhat kind of people does Clinton envision herself fighting for? Clinton says she\u2019s \u201cdoing this,\u201d and has \u201calways done this,\u201d for \u201call the Dorothys.\u201d Who will get Clinton\u2019s attention if she\u2019s elected?\n\nJust look at the faces in these ads. There aren\u2019t any men in hard hats, or on factory floors, yearning to save their blue-collar manufacturing and construction jobs\u2014the kind of guys who seem to overpopulate other candidates\u2019 ads. In Clinton\u2019s new spots the regular folks on display are almost exclusively women and small children. A mom fixing her daughter\u2019s hair. A mom kissing her daughter goodnight. Clinton bending down to take the hand of a pretty little girl. The final image of the spot titled \u201cFamily Strong\u201d shows Clinton cradling her infant granddaughter, as the voice-over notes the former senator\u2019s \u201cnew title: grandma.\u201d\n\nThese ads are, in their words and their imagery, very pointedly about intergenerational female bonds. Women looking out for each other. Looking out for their mothers and their daughters. It\u2019s like a Barbara Kingsolver novel up in here. Clinton will surely target other groups in subsequent spots, but this first salvo suggests that her campaign is, at its core, focused on the female vote.\n\nConsider: The oddest, most jarring moment in either of these ads arrives with their brief, lone reference to Barack Obama. Obama is never mentioned by name. He\u2019s instead labeled, by way of praising Clinton\u2019s magnanimous decision to join his Cabinet, as \u201cthe man who defeated her.\u201d\n\nThe man who defeated her! In the primaries. Seven years ago. Let us marvel at the astonishing subtext of this phrase. He\u2019s not the two-term president from Clinton\u2019s own party who bested two Republican foes. He\u2019s, above all, the man who defeated Hillary Clinton. Emphasis, I might argue, on man.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:51:54.429+0000"}

Those concerns, though, will take a back seat come Thursday when the lucky 10 candidates take the stage at 9 p.m. ET.\n\nAnd the #GOPdebate stage is set: http://t.co/24vTMK4Ypp pic.twitter.com/QqW1xlKFDU \u2014 Josh Voorhees (@JoshVoorhees) August 4, 2015\n\nEven with the network-imposed cap, the chosen candidates are likely to have a tough time standing out on what will still be a historically crowded debate stage. The moderators are expected to try to limit the White House hopefuls to 60-second answers and 30-second rebuttals. (Good luck!) When you factor in commercial breaks and introductions, candidates will probably average less than 10 minutes of speaking time apiece during the two-hour event.\n\nAnd, of course, there's the Trump factor that everyone will have to deal with. Regardless of whether Donald Trump plays it boardroom brash or statesmanlike civil, it's hard to imagine a scenario in which the current GOP front-runner isn't one of the major stories coming out of the debate.\n\n\n\nStill, even a candidate who is relegated to the prime-time periphery by The Donald and his establishment rivals is likely to be better off than the unlucky seven GOP hopefuls who didn't make the cut.

Obama has vowed to veto the resolution, though he would obviously prefer not to. There\u2019s almost certainly enough support to pass a resolution in the House\u2014one congressman claims 218 members, including two Democrats, are already on board. But for a veto-proof, two-thirds majority, the GOP will need all 28 remaining Republicans and 44 Democrats\u2014a tall order.\n\nOn the Senate side, Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake is the only Republican who might conceivably support the deal. But assuming his party can bring him in line, it would still require six Democrats to pass a resolution and 14 to override Obama\u2019s veto.\n\nThe undecided Democrats in both houses, particularly the Jewish members, are currently the targets of a massive lobbying campaign from both sides. A group set up by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee is planning to spend between $20 million and $40 million lobbying against the deal. Raising the rhetorical stakes, the president has compared critics of the deal to backers of the Iraq war who went on to regret their votes.\n\nSo far, it seems like Obama is winning: In the House, the White House has recently picked up the support of Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a prominent member of the House Jewish Caucus, and Michigan\u2019s Sandy Levin, the House\u2019s longest-serving Jewish member. On the Senate side, the White House picked up a major endorsement today with Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia. Kaine, who has been a critic of the administration\u2019s foreign policy on constitutional grounds, was one of the most prominent backers of the legislation setting up the congressional review period, but whatever concerns he had about the agreement itself have apparently been met. Conservative Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia seems to be leaning toward backing the White House as well.\n\nHawkish Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey seems likely to vote with the GOP to kill the deal. And a few senators seem genuinely on the fence, including Delaware\u2019s Chris Coons and Virginia\u2019s Mark Warner. New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer insists he\u2019s undecided but seems to be leaning toward opposing the deal. Schumer, with impeccable pro-Israel bona fides and likely the next Democratic leader, is undoubtedly the biggest prize for both sides.\n\nOverriding Obama\u2019s veto is real long shot. But even if they can\u2019t block the deal, Republicans are looking ahead to the campaign against Hillary Clinton, who quickly endorsed the deal and, as former secretary of state, will inevitably be tied to Obama\u2019s foreign policy, though she was generally more hawkish than the president on Iran.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:52:07.055+0000"}

These settlers draw support and affirmation from political leaders who insist that Jewish rights supersede Palestinian rights and who oversee a system that transforms that belief into facts on the ground. To their credit, Israeli civil society organizations like B\u2019Tselem and Rabbis for Human Rights have been some of the most committed documentarians of these facts\u2014for which they come under constant criticism by right-wing Israelis .\n\nBecause of the international outrage that Ali\u2019s death has generated, we can expect Israeli authorities to give the case special attention. Suspects will almost certainly be found, arrested, tried, and convicted. There will be claims that the system has worked. That will be false. The system is what empowered and enabled Ali\u2019s murderers.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for his part, was eager to change the subject. On Sunday, having apparently decided that two days of grief were enough for a Palestinian child burned alive, he was already back to bashing the Palestinians, insisting that Palestinians celebrate terrorism while Israelis condemn it. (As the Forward\u2019s J.J. Goldberg points out , not only is this utterly graceless, it\u2019s also completely false\u2014lots of streets in Israel are named after Zionist terrorists. Netanyahu himself attended a 2006 ceremony commemorating the 1948 bombing of Jerusalem\u2019s King David Hotel by the terror group Irgun, an attack that killed 92 people.)\n\nDon\u2019t expect acknowledgement of the deeper problems here from the current Israeli government\u2014it\u2019s all in behind the occupation and settlements. While there\u2019s no reason to doubt the government\u2019s regret over the death of a child, it\u2019s reasonable to ask how much that regret is actually worth while it remains committed to the policies that led to that death. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon announced , \u201cWe intend to fight Jewish terror with our full might, without any leniency.\u201d But of course he has no plans to end the system of radical institutionalized inequality that affirms and empowers Jewish extremists while containing Palestinians within a series of disconnected, impoverished cantons.\n\nIt\u2019s tempting to treat last week\u2019s tragic murder of 18-month-old Ali Dawabsheh, burned alive in his bed as the result of a firebomb thrown by suspected Jewish settlers , as somehow separate from the occupation through which Israel has ruled the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and Gaza since 1967. Israeli officials have certainly been at pains to make that case, condemning the murder and promising swift action. But we should note that Ali was the fourth Palestinian killed over the previous week and a half . The reality is that Ali\u2019s murder is only a particularly shocking expression of the violence that Israel\u2019s occupation exacts upon Palestinian civilians every day. And any genuine effort to put a stop to extremist violence in the West Bank, by Israelis or Palestinians, requires a fuller awareness of how that extremism is driven by the occupation, and of the role that the U.S. has played in sustaining it.\n\nOne is from the Palestinian village of Susiya, located in the South Hebron Hills in the West Bank. For months now, the Israeli authorities have been threatening to demolish the village and transfer its inhabitants elsewhere to make room for the growth of a nearby settlement. Even though the Palestinian residents own title to the land, appeals to Israeli courts have proven useless. The threatened expulsion has drawn warnings from both the European Union and the United States, not only from the State Department but also from Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\nOn Sunday, the Washington Post carried a story by Nureddin Amro, a Palestinian resident of al-Sawana in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, detailing the Kafka-esque bureaucratic measures that Israeli authorities have used to justify demolishing his home and seizing the land on which his family has lived for generations. Amro\u2019s story, like Susiya\u2019s, is unique only in its details. There are hundreds of such stories across the occupied territories at any given time.\n\nThis is the background against which individual news stories out of Palestine must be understood. Israelis certainly have a right to provide for their own security, but to justify the occupation on that basis is laughable to anyone even passingly familiar with the constantly shifting maze of regulations that Palestinians must contend with in their effort to live something resembling a normal life.\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of settlers are not violent, although different levels of violence toward the Palestinian population in the occupied territories have accompanied the settlement enterprise since its inception,\u201d wrote Israeli journalist Noam Sheizaf after the attack last week. \u201cThese acts of violence are never an outlier, but as a direct consequence of the situation in the West Bank.\u201d\n\nAs Americans, we don\u2019t have to wonder how we\u2019d react to an occupying power ignoring our rights while insisting on the superiority of its own: We fought a revolution over it. It shouldn\u2019t be hard to understand why a young Palestinian might be attracted to violent solutions after watching years of nonviolent diplomacy produce nothing but more settlements. But the sad truth is that the Washington, D.C., policy community has shown itself to be incapable of addressing the reality of the Israeli occupation in any sustained or serious way. Indeed, in the through-the-looking-glass world of the Washington discussion about Israel-Palestine, it\u2019s possible to find ostensibly serious commentators who deny that the occupation even exists. Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee insists it\u2019s a fiction. And one of the party\u2019s biggest donors, Sheldon Adelson, openly argues that the Palestinians aren\u2019t even a real people.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:52:15.573+0000"}
{"entityId": 307, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images\n\nGOFFSTOWN, New Hampshire\u2014Fourteen of the Republican candidates running for president participated in a campaign forum in New Hampshire Monday night. It was a fascinating view of an alternate universe where there are no insults, talking points reign over candor, and everyone plays by the slow-moving, old rules of politics. In short, Donald Trump wasn\u2019t there.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that the forum was a sleepy affair\u2014interrupted only by a few titters from the audience but no spontaneous applause\u2014the somnolent two hours were free from any stirring remarks by the candidates. Rather, it was like a speed-editing contest where candidates listened to the questions and then rushed to find the paragraphs in their stump speeches that conveyed what they wanted voters to hear without making it appear as though they had ducked the underlying question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat\u2019s the way it normally goes at these things. We scratch our rake across the barren desert of these gatherings for a moment of candor or a flash that gives us some insight into the candidates. We\u2019re pushy. Voters are less so, and for them the event offered some basic introductory information. They got to hear the biography of some candidates\u2014former CEO Carly Fiorina started out as a secretary, and Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s father fled Cuba\u2014and they heard the boiled-down rationale for each candidate\u2014Gov. Scott Walker fought for conservative policies in a purple state, and Gov. John Kasich balanced budgets while thinking about people on the margins of society.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t the speed at which this race is being run right now. Trump is way out in front. In the latest CBS poll, 24 percent of Republican voters support him. Jeb Bush, the closest competitor, is at 13 percent. Walker is at 10 percent. That\u2019s roughly the way things sort in most of the polls.\n\nTrump\u2019s candor is contributing to his poll position. People are so starved for something that sounds authentic that they\u2019ll reward the candidate with the most of it, regardless of the content. In the CBS poll, 79 percent of voters say Trump says what he means. For all the other politicians, that number is about 50 percent. Of the questions asked in the poll, that is the only area where Trump holds that kind of dominant lead over his opponents.\n\nThis is what made Monday night\u2019s forum seem so antiquated. There was very little candor to be found, though to be fair, candidates weren\u2019t given much opportunity. There were so many of them, they had to be shuttled onstage and offstage for questioning that lasted no longer than the duration of a full-service stop at the filling station. While someone was being questioned, all the other candidates sat in the first row with attentive gazes, aware that they would be caught in cutaway shots on C-SPAN.\n\nThe public\u2019s love of candor explains why Trump is doing well with groups who you would expect to balk at him. He leads among Republican primary voters on both sides of the immigration debate, though he\u2019s been criticized for his comments about Mexican immigrants and supports deporting all undocumented workers. He leads with conservatives, though he has supported single-payer health care and has given financial donations to Democrats. He leads with evangelical voters, though he was pro-choice, has been married three times, and said he has never asked God for forgiveness. Even among non\u2013Tea Party voters, Trump is only trailing Bush by a little.\n\nTrump\u2019s candidacy still has serious flaws in the long term. Like in other polls, the CBS poll shows that Republicans like him and continue to like him, but the larger pool of voters do not. Republicans say the more they hear from Trump, the more their opinion of him improved (23 percent) than has gotten worse (12 percent). The exact reverse is true, however, among registered voters, a larger pool that more closely approximates the general electorate. Those general election voters are likely to say that their views of Trump have worsened the more they\u2019ve heard from him. Among registered voters, 59 percent have an unfavorable opinion of Trump. That\u2019s the highest of any human seeking the presidency at the moment.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:52:20.622+0000"}

{"entityId": 312, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "And this brings us to Republican electoral strategies, especially in the South. This past term the Supreme Court decided a redistricting case out of Alabama in which the state\u2019s Republican legislature shoved black voters into fewer districts. The court sent the case back to the district court to determine if race was the predominant factor in creating these districts, which would make the districts unconstitutional.\n\nBut while most Republican leaders are not themselves racist, they have long promoted policies that build on white racism, resentment, and fears of losing dominance in American society. From opposition to busing and affirmative action in the 1970s and 1980s to calls to \u201ctake our country back\u201d in more recent years, the Republican Party is certainly the No. 1 party of racists, even if it is not racist itself.\n\nMany of the ideological leaders of the Republican Party, especially outside the South as it emerged in the 1980s and 1990s, were conservatives but not racist. Think of Roberts, who adheres to a \u201ccolorblind\u201d vision of the Constitution and who seems to believe that racism isn\u2019t a major problem in American society anymore. While acknowledging that racism still exists, he wrote in his Shelby County opinion that \u201cthings have changed in the South.\u201d\n\nWhen Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965, the Democratic Party was dominant in the South, and the Republican Party still had many liberals in its ranks. In part thanks to the Voting Rights Act, which was tremendously successful in fostering the registration and turnout of blacks in the South, the political parties began to realign. Today, the Republican Party is the party of conservatives, and in the South that means primarily white conservatives, and the Democratic Party is the party of liberals, and in the South that means primarily blacks.\n\nBerman\u2019s book, like Jim Rutenberg\u2019s excellent cover story for the New York Times Magazine on the 50 th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, views the struggles over voting rules primarily through the lens of race. And although that is an essential lens to apply, it downplays the growing role of partisan politics in this story, a partisan struggle that is having profound ramifications for the newest wave of court cases involving voting restrictions. Put simply, the Republican Party has reasons unrelated to racial animus to push new voting restrictions.\n\nThe five-decade history of the Voting Rights Act is told masterfully in Ari Berman\u2019s new book, Give Us the Ballot: The Modern Struggle for Voting Rights in America . Berman starts around the time of the Selma, Alabama, marches, but unlike the movie Selma , Berman goes on to give us the rest of the history: the expansion of voting rights protections in 1970 and 1975 to include Latinos, Native Americans, and others over the objections of racists, many in the Democratic Party; the important 1982 rewriting of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, providing additional protections for minority voters nationally, and (now Chief Justice) John Roberts\u2019 key role for the Reagan administration in unsuccessfully fighting against the expansion; hot disputes over voting rights in Florida in the 2000 election; the controversial renewal of the expiring \u201cpreclearance provisions\u201d of the act in 2006 that continued to require states with a history of discrimination to get federal approval before changing their voting laws; and the ongoing \u201c voting wars \u201d that accelerated when Roberts led the court\u2019s conservatives in striking down the 2006 preclearance renewal in Shelby County v. Holder .\n\nIn 2010, the Simpsons featured a news helicopter emblazoned with the logo: \u201cFOX News: Not Racist, But #1 with Racists.\u201d That slogan might be applied to today\u2019s Republican Party, which in recent years has actively passed voting laws that make it harder for poor and minority voters to vote. Whether to label the Republican Party \u201cracist\u201d isn\u2019t an academic exercise. The question is actually at the heart of lawsuits over the future of voting rights in Texas and North Carolina. It\u2019s also a question with historical resonance, particularly on the eve of the Voting Rights Act\u2019s 50 th anniversary this week.\n\nOne view of the redistricting is that the Alabama legislature was motivated by race. Another is that the redistricting was about securing Republican Party advantage: Put blacks\u2014the state\u2019s reliable Democratic voters\u2014into fewer districts and you end up with more Republican districts. But the plaintiffs alleged that Alabama legislators were up to something a bit more subtle: Make sure all the Democratic districts have black representatives so that white racist voters would think of the Democratic Party as the \u201cblack party.\u201d\n\nThinking about whether the Republican Party is motivated by race or party matters not only for these \u201cracial gerrymandering\u201d claims. It is also key to the Voting Rights Act disputes currently in the courts.\n\nSince 2000, we have seen a wave of Republican legislatures passing rules to make it harder to register and vote. One of the lessons of 2000, as both Berman and I have recounted, is that changes to voting rules matter in close elections. So far, attacks that new Republican voting restrictions violate the Constitution because states should not burden voters without good reason have mostly failed. So civil rights activists and Democrats have attacked the laws as Voting Rights Act violations.\n\nIn the case of Texas\u2019 strict voter identification law\u2014which made concealed weapons permits sufficient identification for voting but not student ID cards\u2014a federal district court found that Texas enacted its law with a racially discriminatory intent. Texas has defended itself by saying it had good policy grounds for enacting its laws, but at most its laws were partisan, not racist. The case is currently on appeal. In the North Carolina voting trial over a restrictive set of laws that the state enacted just after the Supreme Court eliminated its preclearance requirement in the Shelby County case, the Justice Department and voting rights activists are trying to prove the law violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. It is a tough claim to bring given the standards of Section 2. The best way for the plaintiffs to win the case is if they can prove that North Carolina had a racially discriminatory intent, but there\u2019s usually no smoking gun to support such claims.\n\nWhy can\u2019t those suing just point to the North Carolina legislature\u2019s bad partisan intent? After all, most observers recognize that the state\u2019s claim that its law is necessary to prevent voter fraud and instill voter confidence is bogus and that this is all about gaining partisan advantage in the next election. The problem is that the Supreme Court hasn\u2019t recognized partisan intent as reason enough to strike down voting restrictions. It upheld Indiana\u2019s law in 2008 even though it appeared it was passed for partisan reasons.\n\nSo we are left with the impossible situation of trying to untangle racial and partisan motives and effects. Especially in the South, with its conflicting racial and party overlap, this is a losing exercise. Nevertheless, civil rights lawyers\u2019 best bet is to attack these laws under the Voting Rights Act and to put the emphasis on race. So in both Texas and North Carolina, the claim is that the Republican legislatures acted as racists. It isn\u2019t clear if the Supreme Court will go along, even if the lower courts continue to make such findings, or if the court will read Section 2 broadly enough to make new voting restrictions illegal absent racial intent.\n\nAs we think about what we need best to protect voting rights going forward, the time has come to add protections for all voters. Today, Republicans see the Voting Rights Act as protection for Democrats, not racial minorities. Although Republicans overwhelmingly supported the 2006 renewal of the Voting Rights Act, Senate Judiciary Committee members issued a report that all but declared the law unconstitutional. The Republican Party will not bite on increased protections for racial minorities; efforts to come up with a new preclearance formula after Shelby County have received very little Republican support.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:52:55.983+0000"}
{"entityId": 313, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images\n\nThere are two things we can already say about Thursday\u2019s GOP debate in Cleveland: The process by which Fox News will select who will be on the main stage\u2014and who won\u2019t be\u2014is a glorified sham. And despite that, it will likely serve as the first major winnowing of a campaign that is still six months away from its first official nominating contest.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nFox News has promised to pick at least 10 GOP hopefuls for the main event based on \u201can average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by Fox News\u201d as of 5 p.m. ET Tuesday\u2014a description that tells us incredibly little about which surveys will make the cut and which won\u2019t. But the fact Fox News honchos appear to be writing the rules as they go is only part of the problem; the very idea that the polls can tell us which candidates make up the top 10 is misguided in itself. As Lee Miringoff, the director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion, told McClatchy over the weekend: \u201cIt\u2019s a bad use of public polls. It asks public polls to have a precision that ignores the margin of error.\u201d Just how firmly do Miringoff and his team believe that? They have temporarily suspended their GOP polling to ensure the network won\u2019t use it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOther pollsters haven\u2019t gone quite as far in protest\u2014but few have made a secret of their displeasure. Monmouth University polling director Patrick Murray released a statement Monday along with his most recent poll that had this to say: \u201cI suppose Fox hoped that a top tier would emerge by the time the first debate rolled around. But based on current polling, there\u2019s no good rationale for arbitrarily selecting a top ten.\u201d To prove his point, his team crunched the numbers and found that when you factor in the poll\u2019s margin of error, only five Republicans can be said to be in the top 10 with statistical certainty\u2014while only two (George Pataki and Jim Gilmore) could definitively be ruled out. The Monmouth team didn\u2019t stop there, either. They included a question in their survey asking voters what they thought about Fox News\u2019 decision to play kingmaker: Less than quarter of respondents picked the top-10 format (23 percent) over two evenly split debates (45 percent) or one giant one (29 percent).\n\nAll that, however, doesn\u2019t change the fact that Fox News\u2019 rules are the ones we have. More than a dozen respected polling outfits have conducted national surveys on the GOP primary this year, so Fox execs should have plenty to pick and choose from depending on which polls they choose to \u201crecognize\u201d and just how literal they want to be in regard to \u201cmost recent.\u201d\n\nMany pollsters keep their schedules a secret for reasons of both accuracy and competitiveness\u2014but most observers expect a flood of them in the lead up to Tuesday\u2019s 5 p.m. deadline. Two relatively safe bets about the polling selection, though: A Fox News poll will make the Fox News-administered grade, while surveys from liberal-leaning outfits like Public Policy Polling (which are nonetheless respected enough to make RealClearPolitics running average) will be left on the cutting room floor.\n\nWith that in mind, we\u2019ll keep a running tab of this week\u2019s polls as they are released.\n\nPoll: CBS News Poll\n\nConducted: 7/29-8/2\n\nRelease Date: Tuesday, August 4, 2015\n\nLast In: Jindal, Perry (2 percent)\n\nLast Out: Kasich, Pataki, Santorum, Gilmore (1 percent)\n\n\n\n1.)

{"entityId": 317, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nA discussion about whether Vice President Joe Biden should run for president gets deep pretty fast. Any talk about ambition, a life\u2019s purpose, and the end of a career must take into account of all the woe Biden has had to face in his life. At age 30, a few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, his wife and 1-year-old daughter died in a car accident. Eighteen days later, he took the oath of office standing at his 3-year-old son Beau\u2019s hospital bedside, where he was being treated for injuries sustained in the crash. In 1988 Biden had two surgeries to address the effects of cranial aneurysms with only a 50 percent chance of success. Two months ago, he buried his 46-year-old son, Beau, the victim of brain cancer. It is supposed to be the other way around. Sons are supposed to bury their fathers.\n\nWe talk about authenticity a lot in politics. Voters look for some view into the interior of a candidate where they can make a connection with something real. When Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump demonstrate authenticity, voters swarm them. Usually we have to peer pretty hard to find a true thing. With Biden, if you look too long, you might have to look away. Sen. Lindsey Graham was brought to tears recently describing Biden. During the 2008 race, I listened to a conversation picked up on a microphone of Biden talking to a voter who had also lost his wife, and I shared Graham\u2019s reaction.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nPeople have been calling Biden for months and telling him he should run. Normally staffers must sort these kinds of calls through a series of normal filters\u2014sycophancy, self-dealing, dislike of the current frontrunner, and activity stirred up by reporters looking for a story. In this case, Biden and his political advisers have to engage in emotional screening: what\u2019s emotion and what\u2019s a genuine sign that there\u2019s a path forward for Biden. Enthusiasm for a run may be overamplified, coming from supporters displaying the human desire to do something for a friend they see suffering. Over the weekend, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd amplified the emotional resonance by reporting that Beau pleaded with his father to run as he was dying.*\n\n\n\nAt the very least the Biden boomlet is a balm.\n\nBiden has wanted to be president for a long time. But as the deadline for his \u201cend of summer\u201d decision gets closer, he must come to terms with the fact that it\u2019s not likely going to happen. Who\u2014as a staffer, friend, or adviser\u2014would want to throw cold water on the public talk of a candidacy before Biden makes that call himself? Why not let him enjoy the urging from the crowd? Those calls of support contain genuine respect, admiration, and gratitude. At the very least the Biden boomlet is a balm.\n\nDespite all of the emotion, those close to Biden say that he understands the difference between the call to run and the actual brutality of the run itself. The big obstacle is that once you strip away the sentiment, Biden doesn\u2019t have a clear rationale for replacing Hillary Clinton as the Democratic nominee. He is not of a new generation, nor does he have a particular ideological advantage. He would trade away the Democratic Party\u2019s gender advantage in the general election. He isn\u2019t a clean break from the Obama years, nor is he so much more identified with Obama than Clinton that he would get a bigger boost than she would if the economy starts to soar heading into November 2016.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say that Biden couldn\u2019t win; it just would require the Clinton campaign\u2019s total collapse. Absent that, Biden would have to out-campaign her. Biden\u2019s previous campaigns don\u2019t suggest that he is a flawless politician on the stump. He\u2019d also have to build a financial and get-out-the vote operation to compete with Clinton\u2019s, which would be an extraordinary organizational challenge. Clinton has a core of passionate supporters. Biden doesn\u2019t have that\u2014emotional affection for a person\u2019s life story is not the same as passion for the cause of his candidacy. Clinton is also still quite popular in her own party. In the most recent Quinnipiac poll, only 9 percent of Democratic voters say they would never vote for her. Six percent said they would never vote for Biden. That\u2019s not enough room to launch a thousand ships.\n\nClinton, while stumbling as she runs without any serious opposition, would almost certainly get better with a focused target she could hit. That means Biden would have to hit back. Would he really be up for that? He\u2019d turn a campaign that started on such an emotional note into a gutter fight over Clinton\u2019s private email server and trust issues\u2014the kinds of subjects he\u2019d have to exploit to win in the close combat that would be inevitable.\n\nThe Democratic presidential campaign is now going through a Biden moment. Those who have his political interests at heart will see if that flickering flame can grow into anything else as the public responds to Joe-mentum. It\u2019s not unlike what happened with Mitt Romney earlier in the year. In the end Romney saw that the emotional outpouring that was elevating him from loser to wise man was not the same as a commitment to back another presidential run. So he settled for just being a party wise man.

The revelation that the vice president\u2019s late son, Beau, had urged his father to make another White House bid was more than a month old, but Dowd\u2019s intimate description\u2014\u201cBeau was losing his nouns and the right side of his face was partially paralyzed\u201d\u2014was enough to breathe fresh life into the speculation. The non-opining political press quickly worked its sources and confirmed that, in the Associated Press\u2019s words, \u201cBiden\u2019s associates have resumed discussions\u201d about a run and that the veep could make a final decision early next month.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nWe don\u2019t know what Biden will ultimately decide\u2014and there\u2019s good reason to assume he\u2019ll say no after all\u2014but what we do know is that, if he jumps into the race, he\u2019ll have his work cut out for him. Hillary Clinton has been routinely battered by bad press this year but she remains incredibly popular with Democrats, many of whom would love to elect the first female U.S. president. She also has a massive head start in fundraising, organizing, endorsements, and pretty much any other campaign category you can imagine. It\u2019s conceivable that the buzz Biden\u2019s late entry would generate would help him close some of those gaps, but Clinton would remain the odds-on favorite to be the one accepting her party\u2019s nomination in Philadelphia next summer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSetting aside whether Biden could win the nomination, though, it\u2019s worth considering just how much he would fundamentally alter the Democratic race just by entering it. (And if you think it\u2019s way too early for this type of speculation\u2014well, there\u2019s a browser extension for that.) Liberals who have been desperate for an Anybody-But-Clinton(-As-Long-As-We-Can-Still-Win) candidate would finally have someone to get excited about. Media outlets that would prefer the drama of a contested primary to the boredom of a coronation\u2014read: all of them\u2014would provide Biden\u2019s campaign with all the attention he could ever want. And his presence on the debate stage this fall would likely change a Hillary vs. the Field sparring round into a head-to-head slugfest between two bold-faced names in the Democratic Party.\n\nMore importantly, Biden\u2019s entry could force Clinton to pick a lane. To date, the former secretary of state has been able to be two things to two sets of voters: to mainstream Democrats and left-leaning independents, she is promising a third Obama term; to progressives with one foot in the party and one out of it, she is promising a more liberal administration than the current one.\n\nWithout Biden, then, Clinton has laid claim to pretty much the entire liberal landscape, save the sliver being held down by Bernie Sanders. With Biden, though, she\u2019d have to cede ground somewhere\u2014or risk watching Biden take it\u2014although it\u2019s unclear where she\u2019d want to land.\n\nAs I\u2019ve explained before, Clinton has already moved left further and faster than almost anyone had expected. But her leftward shifts on criminal justice, immigration, and other issues were largely by her own choosing, and the moves have been safe: While most of her chosen causes are progressive in nature, they also poll relatively well across the political spectrum. It\u2019s unclear how much further she\u2019d be willing to go. And even if she were to try, she\u2019d no doubt have a difficult time convincing already skeptical progressives who have long distrusted her Wall Street ties and her husband\u2019s history of triangulation.\n\nStill, she might have to, because simply promising another Obama term becomes its own awkward proposition if BFD Biden is in the race. As the sitting vice president, he would have a much easier time presenting himself as Obama\u2019s obvious successor. For the past six years, he\u2019s been the president\u2019s right-hand man\u2014sometimes quite literally\u2014on everything from Iran to gun control to Obamacare. And on those rare occasions he (accidentally) broke with his boss, it turned out for the best.\n\nStill, while Biden\u2019s long been a happy warrior, he hasn\u2019t exactly been the best one on the national stage. The same gaffe-filled authenticity that has seemed quaint the past half-decade would be a liability on the campaign trail\u2014even in a year when voters have shown a real hunger for less polished candidates. His 1988 presidential bid didn\u2019t even last to the end of 1987, and his 2008 run ended shortly after a lackluster showing in Iowa.

In other words, it\u2019s not Windows 8, a Frankenstein\u2019s monster of a tablet-plus-desktop OS that alienated everyone from PC manufacturers to corporate users. Instead, Windows 10 is an incremental improvement on Windows 7, one that is faster, slicker, and has some new bells and whistles, like virtual desktops and functional tablet support. One of Windows 10\u2019s leaps, unfortunately, is straight into your personal data.\n\nDavid Auerbach David Auerbach is a writer and software engineer based in New York, and a fellow at New America.\n\n\n\nApple and Google may have ignited the trend of collecting increasing amounts of their customers\u2019 information, but with Windows 10, Microsoft has officially joined that race. By default, Windows 10 gives itself the right to pass loads of your data to Microsoft\u2019s servers, use your bandwidth for Microsoft\u2019s own purposes, and profile your Windows usage. Despite the accolades Microsoft has earned for finally doing its job, Windows 10 is currently a privacy morass in dire need of reform.\n\nScreenshot via Microsoft\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe problems start with Microsoft\u2019s ominous privacy policy, which is now included in the Windows 10 end-user license agreement so that it applies to everything you do on a Windows PC, not just online. (Disclosure: I worked for Microsoft in the days of Windows XP.) It uses some scary broad strokes:\n\nFinally, we will access, disclose and preserve personal data, including your content (such as the content of your emails, other private communications or files in private folders), when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary.\n\nSome have spun conspiracy theories out of that language. I\u2019m more inclined to blame vagueness and sloppiness, not ill intent. With some public pressure, Microsoft is likely to specify how and why it will share your data. But even that won\u2019t excuse Microsoft\u2019s ham-fisted incursion into users\u2019 data, nor how difficult it is restore the level of privacy back to what it was in Windows 7 and 8. Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s privacy policies both have their own issues of collection and sharing, but Microsoft\u2019s is far vaguer when it comes to what the company collects, how it will use it, and who it will share it with\u2014partly because Microsoft\u2019s one-size-fits-all privacy policy currently applies to all your data, whether it\u2019s on your own machine or in the cloud. As Microsoft puts it:\n\nRather than residing as a static software program on your device, key components of Windows are cloud-based. \u2026 In order to provide this computing experience, we collect data about you, your device, and the way you use Windows.\n\nIn other words, Microsoft won\u2019t treat your local data with any more privacy than it treats your data on its servers and may upload your local data to its servers arbitrarily\u2014unless you stop Microsoft from doing so. Microsoft\u2019s security story has been far from perfect; this move could make it far worse. For now, it\u2019s not easy to restrict what Windows collects, but here\u2019s how.\n\nDon\u2019t Use Express Settings During Setup\n\nDuring installation, Microsoft will encourage you to accept its \u201cexpress install\u201d defaults. Without exceptions, these defaults will result in the maximum sharing of your information with Microsoft. Instead, select the \u201ccustom install\u201d option, which will bring up a bunch of toggles. The first set of toggles, concerning personalization and location, looks like this:\n\nScreenshot via Microsoft\n\nThese settings all send your personal data to Microsoft with little upside for you (unless you like customized advertising). I recommend turning them all off.\n\nThe second set of toggles is more cryptic but more important:\n\nScreenshot via Microsoft\n\nWhile the first two settings here, for SmartScreen and page prediction, simply send more of your activity to Microsoft, the next two are subtler. Automatic connection to open hotspots and to your contact\u2019s networks means that your computer will connect to certain networks without your explicit consent. Unless you trust Microsoft\u2019s judgment and all of your contacts, it\u2019s best to disable those. Last, sending error and diagnostic information may seem harmless, but when something goes wrong, that \u201cinformation\u201d might include tons of sensitive stuff\u2014if you were editing a spreadsheet of your romantic dalliances when your computer crashed, it\u2019ll get uploaded. If you feel like helping out Microsoft, you can leave this enabled, but I turned it off.\n\nTurn Off the Secret Settings\n\nThe install settings are only a subset of Windows 10\u2019s privacy settings, which occupy more than a dozen different pages and dialogue boxes across the user interface, none of them in plain sight. Moreover, one of them reveals that Microsoft wasn\u2019t being quite honest during setup.

Fox News optimistically describes the vote as a \u201cfirst step in a renewed battle\u201d to destroy the venerable women's health organization. But this dog-and-pony show is less about defunding Planned Parenthood and more about giving Republican politicians a chance to reassure their base that they, too, hate the idea of low-income women obtaining affordable reproductive health care.

The rule is designed to speed up the retirement of the nation\u2019s fleet of coal-fired power plants\u2014the most carbon-intensive way of creating electricity\u2014and could more than double the rate of coal plant closures by 2040.\n\nIn a video preview of the new rule, Obama called the Clean Power Plan \u201cthe biggest, most important step we\u2019ve ever taken to combat climate change.\u201d While that statement may be true, it\u2019s not saying a whole heck of a lot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs I wrote last year when the rule was initially announced, many states are already well on their way to achieving the required reductions, thanks in part to a recent boom in cheap natural gas and the Obama administration\u2019s choice of 2005 as the basis year for cuts, which was close to America\u2019s all-time peak in carbon emissions. Obama\u2019s plan is significant, but it\u2019s not bold.\n\nA previous version of the targets, announced last year, would have required states to begin implementing changes to their power-producing mix in 2020. The final rule, to be announced Monday, gives states and utilities an extra two years, until 2022. The targets will vary by state, depending on their current energy mix, and states will have flexible ways of achieving emissions reductions, including an option to join an interstate cap-and-trade scheme.\n\nAll this will be a heavy lift for some coal-intensive states, like Wyoming, but it\u2019s being heralded as largely \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d for some states, like Minnesota, that have already made significant efforts to shift their energy mix.\n\nWe can, and should, do much more.\n\nAccording to the New York Times and the independent Climate Action Tracker website\u2014which helps keep world leaders honest in the run-up to this year\u2019s possibly pivotal international climate negotiations in Paris\u2014the new rule puts America on a middling emissions-reduction pathway, at best.\n\nVox\u2019s Brad Plumer has calculated that the president\u2019s rule would shave just 6 percent from U.S. carbon emissions by 2030. Climate science and international equity demand the U.S. cut emissions 80 percent by then. We\u2019re nowhere near that pace.\n\nStill, this plan is not nothing. In its coverage, the Times includes this hopeful gem:\n\nBut experts say that if the rules are combined with similar action from the world\u2019s other major economies, as well as additional action by the next American president, emissions could level off enough to prevent the worst effects of climate change.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of hedging on which to base a climate legacy.\n\nIn fact, when compared with the climate plans of his would-be successors on the left\u2014Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O\u2019Malley\u2014Obama\u2019s ranks last in terms of ambition. Clinton, who has frequently aligned herself with the president on climate, announced a preview of her own climate plan last week. It\u2019s fractionally more ambitious than Obama\u2019s, but it essentially just kicks the can forward another few years.\n\nAnd as Slate\u2019s Daniel Politi writes, there\u2019s no guarantee the plan will endure in its current form after the president leaves office. Obama\u2019s plan faces a phalanx of attacks from the political right, and legal challenges\u2014which may take several years\u2014could find their way to the Supreme Court. Obama has vowed to veto any actions to weaken it from a hostile Congress as long as he remains in office. As Jason Plautz of National Journal writes, the next president may not be so climate-friendly, so the ultimate fate of Obama\u2019s climate legacy will be in the hands of others.\n\nIn a video touting the new climate rule, Obama\u2019s lead environmental advocate, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy, said that if the rule moves forward, \u201cWe\u2019ll know we\u2019re doing all we can, together, to take action against climate change.\u201d That\u2019s simply not true. We can, and should, do much more.\n\nLast week, former NASA climate scientist James Hansen, fresh off a dire new warning about global sea levels, had harsh words for the slow, incremental progress that\u2019s formed essentially the entirety of American\u2019s climate ambition to date. \u201cWe have two political parties, neither one of which is willing to face reality,\u201d Hansen told the Guardian. \u201cConservatives pretend it\u2019s all a hoax, and liberals propose solutions that are non-solutions.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just plain silly,\u201d said Hansen, speaking specifically of Clinton\u2019s planned renewable energy push. \u201cNo, you cannot solve the problem without a fundamental change, and that means you have to make the price of fossil fuels honest.\u201d\n\nIn the end, our climate won\u2019t care about how we fix this problem. But it\u2019s clear that time is running out. If Obama truly wants to go all-in on climate change, he should meet Republicans where they are\u2014as painful as that might be\u2014and negotiate a way to pass a carbon tax.

And that's even today, with larger ships, jet cargo aircraft, and more people. While it makes for a great strategy, in the end, it's just a nonstarter. Why?\n\nThe Germans had no forward base in the New World. If they had seized Iceland, any of the French protectorates in the Caribbean, or northern South America, then an invasion, while still a stretch, could have been conceivable. Without forward bases to deploy to and from, an invasion isn't going to happen.\n\nConsider that the Wehrmacht was winning while America was out of the war. One of the most idiotic things Hitler did was to declare war on the United States on Dec. 11, 1941. While the Wehrmacht was about to get thrashed in the Soviet Union, it could have stage-managed that into a negotiated settlement if it had chosen to. When the U.S. entered the war, it was all in, and Germany didn't have the cards for that kind of bet. Invading North America would have simply brought the U.S. immediately into the war, with results that would have been more disastrous than they were.\n\nAnd even if the Germans had landed a sizable force here, how where they going to be resupplied? Any such force would have been trapped here until it was defeated, destroyed, or retreated. The U.S. could play at the U-boat game, and the Germans would have needed open logistics lines to keep themselves supplied. Assuming that they were somehow able to move further inland, they still would need a corridor or corridors open to the ocean for supplies and retreat. Not seeing how that could have happened.\n\nIn addition, everybody had guns. One commonality among the nations conquered by Germany is that private firearms ownership was heavily restricted or simply banned. With no such restrictions here and given the fact that modern combined arms tactics were still in their infancy, it's difficult to see how the Germans would have avoided taking heavy casualties. The Germans would have faced an armed force at least 10 times the size of their invasion force, who were also motivated to ensure that they (the Germans) would lose.\n\nThe Germans also still would have had to undertake European battles along with their invasion here. England was bombing German cities. The Soviet Union was beginning what would be its bloody push to force the Germans out of its homeland. Italy was losing in North Africa, necessitating German assistance there. Yugoslavia's partisan conflicts were just beginning. And Germany had large areas of France, Poland, Norway, and the Low Countries that it needed troops garrisoned in just to keep pacified. If they could have found a million or so \u201cspare\u201d force to throw at an attack on the U.S., it would still have maintain its status quo in the lands that it already conquered.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:54:20.875+0000"}

And the numbers are mighty depressing. \u201cThe 67 biggest donors, each of whom gave $1 million or more, donated more than three times as much as the 508,000 smallest donors combined,\u201d reports Politico. These 67 donors gave a whopping $128 million in cold hard cash to super PACs that support specific presidential candidates.\n\nOverall, super PACs have raised $271 million from 9,500 donors. To put that number in perspective, super PACs spent $374 million during the entire 2012 campaign cycle and we\u2019re not even in the primaries yet. \u201cAt this point in 2011, only one of the 12 Republican contenders had a super-PAC. That was Mitt Romney, whose super-PAC's $12 million haul was less than the $18 million raised by his official campaign at that point,\u201d notes Bloomberg.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAnd the big money is bigger than ever. In 2012, a mere six Republicans donated $5 million or more over the course of the entire campaign cycle.

Even though the amounts may be higher than ever, the names are all pretty familiar. \u201cThe relative absence of new faces in the very small pool of really big donors magnifies the impact of ultra-wealthy individuals who have been participating in the process for years,\u201d points out the Center for Responsive Politics in a piece in the Guardian.\n\nIn what may be an ominous sign of things to come though, the financial disclosure reports also reveal just how much candidates have outsourced some of their traditional operations to super PACs.

Many of them, running for president or aspiring to leadership roles in Congress, are trying to block the nuclear deal with Iran. This would be a good time for these leaders to show that they\u2019re ready for the responsibilities of national security and foreign policy. Instead, they\u2019re showing the opposite. Over the past several days, congressional hearings on the deal have become a spectacle of dishonesty, incomprehension, and inability to cope with the challenges of a multilateral world.\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\nWhen the hearings began more than a week ago, I was planning to write about the testimony of Secretary of State John Kerry and Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. But the more I watched, the more I saw that the danger in the room wasn\u2019t coming from the deal or its administration proponents. It was coming from the interrogators. In challenging Kerry and Moniz, Republican senators and representatives offered no serious alternative. They misrepresented testimony, dismissed contrary evidence, and substituted vitriol for analysis. They seemed baffled by the idea of having to work and negotiate with other countries. I came away from the hearings dismayed by what the GOP has become in the Obama era. It seems utterly unprepared to govern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIf you didn\u2019t have time to watch the 11 hours of hearings conducted on July 23, July 28, and July 29, consider yourself lucky. Here are the lowlights of what you missed.\n\n1. North Korea. In all three hearings, Kerry explained how the inspection and verification measures in the Iran deal are designed to rectify flaws that led to the failure of the North Korean nuclear agreement. He spent much of his opening statement outlining these differences. This made no impression. When the Senate held its next hearing a week later, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the presiding Republican, dismissed the Iran agreement with a quip: \u201cHow did that North Korean deal work out for you?\u201d\n\n2. Israel. As evidence that the Iran deal is bad, Republicans point to criticism from Israel. But they seem more interested in the rhetoric of Israeli politicians than in the judgments of Israeli security experts. At the July 23 hearing, Kerry read from an article that quoted supportive statements about the deal from the former leaders of two Israeli intelligence agencies. Republicans batted the quotes away. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming scoffed, \u201cThat wasn\u2019t even in the newspaper. That was a blog post.\u201d Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina dismissed the statements as irrelevant because they didn\u2019t come from elected officials. Why listen to experts when you can rely instead on quotes from politicians?\n\n3. The IAEA\u2019s \u201csecret deal.\u201d Kerry and Moniz have repeatedly explained that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which enforces nuclear conduct agreements, publicly evaluates each country\u2019s compliance but keeps some details about inspection logistics private. The IAEA briefs other governments about its procedures but doesn\u2019t give them the logistical documents. Republicans, having shrugged at this policy for decades, are suddenly outraged. Many of them seem to think the Obama administration is colluding with Iran and the IAEA. They claim that Susan Rice, Obama\u2019s national security adviser, has seen the IAEA\u2019s Iran documents but won\u2019t show them to Congress. In the House hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Ted Poe of Texas asserted that Rice \u201csaid that she has seen this deal with the IAEA.\u201d Kerry corrected him: \u201cSusan Rice\u2019s quote is, \u2018We know their contents, and we\u2019re satisfied with them. We will share the contents of those briefings in full and classified sessions with Congress.\u2019 She has not seen them. She has been briefed on them.\u201d\n\nKerry\u2019s clarification should have settled the matter. But it didn\u2019t. The next day, Sen. Jim Inhofe of Oklahoma grilled Kerry:\n\nInhofe: Secretary Rice [sic] said she has seen the deal with the IAEA. \u2026 Did you see it at the same time, or prior to the time, that Secretary Rice saw it?\n\nKerry: Senator, National Security Adviser Rice has not seen it.\n\nInhofe: Well she said she did yesterday ...\n\nKerry: No. She has been briefed on it. I had\u2014I gave her exact quote to Congressman Poe. \u2026 She has been briefed on it but has not actually seen it.\n\nInhofe: OK, I will give you her quote and make sure it is in the record here. \u2026 \u201cShe said six days ago she had seen it and reviewed it, and that Congress will get to see it in a classified session.\u201d\n\nKerry: Senator, you are quoting Congressman Poe, and\u2014\n\nInhofe: Who is quoting her. This is quotation marks.\n\nRepublicans can be forgiven for misinterpreting Rice\u2019s original statement. But why would they cling to that interpretation after being corrected? And why would they quote their own misinterpretations rather than what Rice said?\n\n4. EMPs. In the July 23 Senate hearing, Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin asked Moniz about a 2008 commission report on EMPs, electromagnetic pulses, which could be triggered by nuclear detonations and could knock out the U.S. power grid. Moniz, the former chairman of MIT\u2019s physics department, has spent his career working in nuclear science. He told Johnson that he was unfamiliar with the report but that \u201cif you look at our Quadrennial Energy Review published in April, we do identify EMP as a risk to transformers, and we are beginning to try to work up a response to that.\u201d\n\nIn the hearing on Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas used this exchange to portray Moniz as an idiot:\n\nCruz: You told the United States Senate you hadn\u2019t read the congressionally mandated commission on EMPs and that you didn\u2019t know what an EMP was.\n\nMoniz: That is incorrect. I said I did not know this 2008 report recommendations. I said I was quite familiar with the issue, and we all know about EMPs from airburst nuclear weapons.\n\nCruz: Secretary, let me read the testimony verbatim so that I don\u2019t mischaracterize you. \u2026 \u201cSenator Johnson: \u2018Are you familiar with the EMPs commission 2008 report?\u2019 \u2018No, I am not, sir.\u2019 \u2018You\u2019re not? Do you know\u2014do you know what an EMP is?\u2019 \u2018You\u2019ll have to explain it to me, please.\u2019 \u201d I find that stunning. \u2026\n\nMoniz: That was about the report. If you read further in the testimony, you will see my explicit statement. Of course I know about the issue.\n\nCruz: Do you agree that an EMP detonated by Iran in the atmosphere could kill tens of millions of Americans? \u2026\n\nMoniz: It depends upon the specifics. These are highly variable\u2014\n\nCruz: Does that mean, yes, it could?\n\nMoniz: I said it is highly variable in its\u2014\n\nCruz: OK.

Even if the belligerent billionaire and current GOP front-runner doesn\u2019t implode on the debate stage next week or on the campaign trail next month, the fundamentals of American politics will still catch up to him: At some point the GOP field will narrow and an establishment favorite will consolidate enough support to knock Trump from his perch. Eventually, that means he will exit a nominating battle he cannot win.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that the Washington parlor game of predicting how Trump\u2019s campaign will end is now turning into one about what will happen with his supporters when it does.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere is no shortage of possibilities. Writing in the National Journal on Friday, for example, political analyst Charlie Cook pegs Chris Christie and Ted Cruz\u2019s camps as likely homes for Trump\u2019s backers once their first choice is out of the race. In the Washington Post, meanwhile, James Holmann calls it a \u201cjump ball\u201d before ultimately suggesting Trump\u2019s loss could be Mike Huckabee\u2019s gain. While the predictions vary, the rationale behind them is usually the same: Whoever wins the Trump sweepstakes will be someone who shares his anti-establishment anger.\n\nBut while Trump\u2019s outsider appeal is undeniable, a closer look at the polls suggests it may also be overblown. In the last national survey conducted by Fox News, for instance, pollsters reassigned Trump supporters based on their declared second choice. The biggest winner? None other than establishment poster boy Jeb Bush, who saw his support climb by more than a third to 19 percent. (The bizarre Bush-Trump overlap can also be seen in reverse: With Jeb out, Trump\u2019s support climbs by 3 points, the biggest jump of any member of the field.) It\u2019s only one poll, of course, but we\u2019ve seen similar trends in others.\n\nThat suggests that for all the talk of Trump\u2019s anti-establishment street cred, it can only partly explain his current surge. The other part is even more difficult to pin down with any accuracy: Many of his supporters seem to be attracted to Trump the man as much as they are to his message. As one member of a Bloomberg focus group recently put it: \u201cHe's just tough, we need someone tough.\u201d Said another: \u201cHe says it like it is.\u201d Plenty of candidates are offering something similar\u2014Cruz shares his hard line on immigration; Christie offers his own type of decorum-free bluster\u2014but it\u2019s also clear that none of them is offering the literally one-of-a-kind Trump experience.\n\nI saw this firsthand earlier this month at a summit of born-again evangelicals in Ames, Iowa, where Trump repeatedly drew cheers from the crowd despite bumbling through a series of questions about his faith. \u201cWhen we go in church and I drink the little wine \u2026 and I eat the little cracker\u2014I guess that\u2019s a form of asking forgiveness,\u201d Trump said at one point. A candidate not named Donald would have been unlikely to get away with that same answer.\n\nThe only common denominator among Trump, Bush, and the half-dozen or more alternatives Trump\u2019s backers list as their second choice in national surveys is that they are all running for the GOP nomination. (Even Rick Perry, Scott Walker, and Lindsey Graham\u2014whom have all taken their fair share of shots from Trump\u2014see their numbers inch up without him around.) The truth is, Trump\u2019s support remains something of a mystery. And if we don\u2019t understand his coalition in the present, it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ll be able to predict how it will act in the future.\n\nElsewhere in Slate: The Case for Covering Trump: Why the media shouldn\u2019t ignore his doomed campaign.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:54:45.952+0000"}

A New York magazine piece about Stern and Trump from 1989 tells a similar story, though I'm not sure it goes so far as to support the verb \"suppressed\"\u2014more that no broadcasters wanted to deal with the pain in the ass of potential Trump suits (none of which were actually ever filed) over what was seen less as a hard-hitting 60 Minutes expos\u00e9 than as a kind of dishy tabloid piece. And, as the new site acknowledges, the documentary was publicly screened in 1991 in the Hamptons by original executive producer Ned Schnurman in a fruitless attempt to find distribution.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n(The New York piece, FWIW, is also highly recommended reading for '80s NYC nostalgia fans.

Leonard Stern is still alive, and in 1991 told the Times he did not believe that Ned Schnurman had legal rights to the footage but that he (Stern) was not going to retaliate against \"a little guy with no money\" for screening it.

These fine points are certainly crucial to many who how the agreement will be implemented, but in the context of the political debate over the agreement, they don\u2019t actually matter that much.\n\nAs Steve Coll put it recently, while the deal has strengths and weaknesses and involves significant concessions from both sides, \u201cObama\u2019s best argument \u2026 is not the fine print but the fact that the deal is better than any other realistic course of action.\u201d The argument for the deal, from the administration\u2019s perspective, is that while Iran may be a malign force in world politics, its leaders are rational actors who respond to incentives and will see that giving up a nuclear weapons program in exchange for sanctions relief is a better course of action than a return to isolation and the threat of war. Allowing the country to maintain much of its nuclear infrastructure is a risk, but one worth taking if it can prevent either an Iranian nuke or a dangerous and likely ineffective military strike.\n\nThe deals critics reject this premise, arguing the Iran will cheat if given the opportunity. Even it doesn\u2019t, these critics would say, the cash windfall from sanctions relief will allow it to increase its support for terrorist groups and anti-American governments in the region. Better to keep in place the sanctions to weaken a regime that will invariably be a threat to the United States and Israel.\n\nIf you feel either way, the details of the agreement aren\u2019t going to sway you.

The Nonhuman Rights Project had filed a petition for the two chimps, Hercules and Leo, for a writ of habeas corpus freeing them from unlawful imprisonment. In denying the petition, Jaffe could have laughed off the NRP\u2019s claims. Instead, she wrote a surprisingly thoughtful opinion that gives both liberty and morality a fair shake.\n\nTo its credit, the NRP has not argued that chimps and other great apes have a constitutional right to habeas corpus. (You don\u2019t have to be an originalist to believe that the United States Constitution was written exclusively for Homo sapiens.) Instead, the NRP is attempting to develop a habeas right in New York\u2019s common law. That\u2019s a smart strategy. Common law is developed by judges and can be modified by the legislature; in fact, both New York courts and the legislature have recently begun to treat animals as something more than property (though less than people). NRP is only looking to extend this trend by persuading Jaffe to declare that chimps deserve basic habeas protection.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nJaffe takes this claim seriously despite its novelty. No offense intended, I assume, but she does so by repeatedly citing the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions broadening the rights of liberty for gay Americans. \u201cIf rights were defined by who exercised them in the past,\u201d she notes, quoting Obergefell v.

Chimps also seem to demonstrate compassion, depression, and a sense of humor. They may not be human\u2014but they aren\u2019t totally inhuman.\n\nStill, Jaffe writes, questions about chimps\u2019 right to autonomy should be answered by a higher court or the legislature\u2014not a supreme court judge. (In New York, supreme courts are low-level trial courts.) While quoting another gay rights ruling, Lawrence v. Texas\u2019 admonishment that \u201ctimes can blind us to certain truths,\u201d Jaffe throws out the petition for Hercules and Leo\u2019s release. \u201cEfforts to extend legal rights to chimpanzees are understandable,\u201d she writes. \u201cSomeday they may even succeed.\u201d That day, however, is not today.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:55:08.272+0000"}

In no area has he done more pioneering work than in the field of insults. He has insulted countries, political opponents, senior Republican leaders, and entire classes of people\u2014from Mexican immigrants to POWs. So it would be reasonable to expect that when he takes the center lectern next week for the first Republican debate, he\u2019ll continue true to form\u2014a knee to the groin here, a sweeping denunciation there. The word stupid is no doubt already limbered up and bouncing around his verbal ready-room.\n\nBut isn\u2019t the obvious gambit restraint?

He is at the top of the polls, but those same polls show that he isn\u2019t likely to stay there. The recent Quinnipiac poll highlights the dilemma. In the political horserace among candidates, Trump gets 20 percent of the support of GOP voters. The only other competitors in double digits are Gov. Scott Walker (13 percent) and Jeb Bush (10 percent). But Trump also has the highest unfavorable rating: 59 percent. Only 27 percent of voters polled have a favorable view of him, and 30 percent of Republicans say they will never vote for Trump. That\u2019s the highest of any candidate. By comparison, Christie, the competitor with the second-highest score on this scale, turns off only 15 percent of voters. Hillary Clinton has a terminal problem with only 9 percent of voters. As a result, when those Quinnipiac respondents are asked about the general election, Trump loses to Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Vice President Joe Biden in head-to-head match-ups.* That\u2019s not true of any other Republican candidate.\n\nCarrying this gambit would take some skill, especially for a candidate who believes so thoroughly in his own instincts. When people regularly praise you for telling it like it is, it will be hard to stow that trait for a full 90 minutes. On the other hand, Trump is selling himself as a great negotiator. Then he is no doubt familiar with the black-hat/white-hat approach, whereby a negotiator moves from tough and unyielding to generous and compromising. Pull this off and the person on the other side winds up feeling a little gratitude for you giving him what he wants.\n\nTrump has been downplaying expectations for a few days, saying that he\u2019s never really been in a debate. Presumably there is some debate in negotiation, but never mind: That rare bit of modesty is proof he has the capacity to play-act for effect. If Trump can pause his natural, driving impulses for the good of a larger strategy, it might be the first time in this campaign that he\u2019s elevated himself by making himself smaller.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:55:10.051+0000"}

We should replace it with a smarter approach that empowers the Cuban private sector, Cuban civil society, and the Cuban-American community to spur progress and keep pressure on the regime.\n\nToday I am calling on Speaker [John] Boehner and Senator [Mitch] McConnell to step up and answer the pleas of the Cuban people. By large majorities, they want a closer relationship with America. They want to buy our goods, read our books, surf our web, and learn from our people. They want to bring their country into the 21st century. That is the road toward democracy and dignity. We should walk it together.\n\nShould congress fail to act, Clinton vowed that as president she would \u201cuse executive authority to make it possible for more Americans to visit Cuba.\u201d\n\nClinton, who back in 2008 criticized then-primary opponent Obama for his promises to engage with Catro\u2019s government, more or less took ownership of the Obama administration\u2019s recent Cuba moves in the speech. She also reiterated what she had said in her book Hard Choices about having recommended to the president that he take a look at ending the embargo at the end of her tenure as secretary of state.\n\nIn the speech, she pledged more support to democratic reforms in Cuba and opponents of the Castro regime. In one of the speech\u2019s more interest moments, she gave a nod to Miriam Leiva\u2014the founder of an advocacy group of wives and female relatives of jailed dissidents that had previously criticized Clinton for calling to end the embargo\u2014who was in the crowd. Clinton also praised the Cuban-American community in Miami as a \u201ccompelling advertisement for the benefits of democracy and an open society.\u201d\n\nAs for her Republican opponents, she accused them of viewing \u201cCuba and Latin American more broadly through an outdated cold war lens\u201d as a \u201cland of crime and coups\u201d rather than \u201cfree markets and free people.\u201d Should the recent moves be reversed, she suggested, \u201cno one will benefit more than the hardliners in Havana.\u201d\n\nWith frequent references to the power of free-market capitalism to transform societies, the speech seemed designed to put Republican candidates in the position of defending the increasingly unpopular embargo. The embargo was once a third rail of American electoral politics, but no longer. A healthy majority of Americans support ending the embargo, including 59 percent of Republicans. Even a narrow majority of Cuban-Americans support the Obama administration\u2019s recent moves. Obama won the once staunchly Republican Cuban vote in Florida in 2012. While a large portion of that community strongly opposes lifting the embargo, Clinton is clearly betting that by keeping the emphasis on the right of Cuban-Americans to maintain contact with their families and the power of good old American capitalism to transform the island, she can keep their votes.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:55:10.984+0000"}
{"entityId": 338, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nTake a moment and try to remember where you were 24 hours ago. Maybe you\u2019re a creature of habit and it\u2019s easy to guess. Or maybe, like me, you can\u2019t quite recall whether you were at work, at home, or somewhere in between. Either way, if you had your cellphone with you, it would be astonishingly easy for someone with the right access to pin your location down. Thanks to a recent court decision, however, that information just got a lot harder to examine for many in the United States.\n\nIn an order released Thursday by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, Judge Lucy Koh found that Fourth Amendment protections extend to location data generated by cellphones. Ruling against the federal government, Koh affirmed that law enforcement agencies must seek a warrant before acquiring historical location data produced by a cellphone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs Koh explains, modern phones constantly ping cellular towers, even when they\u2019re not actively in use. Thanks to these regular connections, they generate a steady stream of data about their physical location\u2014sometimes even when the user turns off location services, a fact that the ACLU stressed in an amicus brief. Koh notes that many users may be unaware of how much information they\u2019re giving up as they move through the world. This data, which is known as cell site location information (or CSLI) can be important to legal investigations.\n\nIn the past, courts have largely avoided the issue of whether CSLI should be readily available. Koh writes, \u201cNeither the U.S. Supreme Court nor the Ninth Circuit has squarely addressed whether cell phone users possess a reasonable expectation of privacy in the CSLI, historical or otherwise, associated with their cell phones.\u201d\n\nPrevious relevant cases were mostly built around more basic technologies. In 1983, for example, the Supreme Court held that an individual\u2019s movements along public thoroughfares could be tracked via his or her beeper. A year later, the court clarified and restricted this decision, stressing that it did not apply when a user was within his or her private home.\n\nKoh\u2019s decision ultimately turns around the increasingly central role that cellphones play in almost all of our lives. \u201cFor many,\u201d she writes, \u201ccell phones are not a luxury good; they are an essential part of living in modern society.\u201d That\u2019s in keeping with recent case law, which increasingly holds that we shouldn\u2019t have to choose between participating in the contemporary moment and maintaining our privacy. For instance, in 2014 the Supreme Court ruled, in Riley v. California, that law enforcement needs a warrant to search a person\u2019s cellphone as part of an arrest.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees. Earlier this week, a Cincinnati appeals court found that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy if you accidentally butt dial someone. As Slate\u2019s Lily Hay Newman explained, the judge in that case held that being overheard during a butt dial is a bit like having an argument near an open window.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:55:25.557+0000"}
{"entityId": 339, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "On a brutally hot and humid Saturday, a thickset man with a jet-black mustache wolf-whistles an alert when the rare police car cruises by. The atmosphere is less suspicious than pragmatic; there\u2019s no use in anyone getting into any trouble so close to Europe. Greece is preferred, since it is in the EU\u2019s Schengen Area of visa-free travel, but its border is shorter and better-policed than the broad plains of Bulgaria. Either way, nobody is talking about where they are off to or what they are up to. Photographs can only cause problems. As such, they are strongly frowned upon.\n\nThe cluster of pensions, phone shops, and car agencies sits on Edirne\u2019s far western edge, on the way out of town. There are underclothes, boxers, and socks hanging out of many pension windows, which gives the area a peculiar look of having a transient camp occupy permanent space. The Syrians are mostly 20 to 30 years old and spend their time either in PlayStation caf\u00e9s or dealing cards. Every so often a car comes up and a few men grab their duffel bags and hop in.\n\nThis may be why Syrians are less visible in Edirne than they are in far larger Istanbul. According to Keskin, the 2 million Syrians in Istanbul, in refugee camps, and in southern Turkey are largely here to stay. In Edirne, they\u2019re only there to leave.\n\nCoinciding with this Balkan exodus was the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. Though it\u2019s remembered heroically in Syrian history, the architects of the Turkish state saw it as betrayal. It should be old history by now, but as Keskin puts it, Turkish textbooks portray the Arabs \u201cas a dirty, ignorant, uncivilized, non-trustable back-stabber nation.\u201d Edirne\u2019s people, the vast majority of whom trace their roots to these Balkan refugees, see themselves as \u201cSons of the Conquerors,\u201d as a popular nationalist saying goes. The Syrians are seen as the sons of the perfidious.\n\nUnlike those who came a century ago, \u201crefugees from Syria aren\u2019t considered as being part of Turkishness,\u201d Keskin says. \u201cThey have never been considered as the ones who have a right to claim their part.\u201d In the early 1900s, nearly a million Muslims fled the new Balkan nation-states for Turkey. Known as muhacir in Turkish, thousands died of starvation, and at the hands of lynch mobs and bandits on their way to Edirne and all points south. But they were fortunate, in a way, since they were fleeing to a Turkey still defining what \u201cTurkishness\u201d meant. The Turkish language hadn\u2019t been standardized yet; decades of war had the grotesque effect of giving these Balkan migrants job opportunities; a revolutionary education system would forge their children into Turks.\n\nKeskin is a historian and a novelist, and he tries to explain how Syrian refugees fit into the region\u2019s migration history. He\u2019s a good person to do so, since he just published a novel about a Syrian family\u2019s flight through Edirne, called The Exile of the Cactus Flower. Balding, with a grad student\u2019s beard, Keskin talks over a frappe. It\u2019s an affectation he picked up in Greece, where he was studying the 1923 population exchange that uprooted as many as 500,000 Greek Muslims from their homeland and brought them to Turkey, where few spoke the language or knew the customs.\n\nThe United Nations estimates that more than 6 million Syrians are displaced\u2014nearly a third of the population. An incredible 2 million of these individuals are in Turkey, and an untold number of them are trying to make their way to Europe, where, to hear them say it, the streets are paved in gold. The streets are just asphalt in this northwest corner of Turkey, but all roads to Europe go through Edirne. From a historian\u2019s perspective, they always have.\n\nEDIRNE, Turkey\u2014Five miles from the promised land, there\u2019s everything a migrant might need: rental car agencies that provide their own drivers; a cheap place to spend the night biding time; pay-as-you-go cellphones; and a chicken doner in perpetual motion. Edirne isn\u2019t big, and most tourist guides highlight a gorgeous mosque and the locals\u2019 penchant for fried liver. But those guides ignore Edirne\u2019s greatest advantage for innumerable visitors: It\u2019s five miles to Greece, the European Union, and potential refugee status. Edirne is the last stop before Europe.\n\nTwo different places have Arabic signs. Both say \u201cRestaurant\u201d in Arabic, but one is a proper sit-down place without a Turkish name, only an English \u201cCash and Carry\u201d on the awning. The other features two exhausted-looking Turks and one sad-looking chicken doner. There are only patrons at the second place. A pair of Syrian men help their young companion in a wheelchair eat some bread and chicken. With a goatee, blond hair, and a blue-eyed gaze, the father looks like an Ohio high school football coach. The other man just looks tired, and the boy in the wheelchair is enjoying the chicken. It is unclear where they are staying, but they aren\u2019t around the next day.\n\nPhoto by Asher Kohn\n\nThere is clearly some support for the refugee community here in town. Edirne is famously more secular than most of Turkey, but at the teahouse there is talk of being \u201cbrother Muslims.\u201d Wherever these Syrians are going in Europe, they will be relying on networks of fellow Syrians and religious foundations as much as state bureaucracies. If they end up in Germany or the Netherlands, they will likely pray at a mosque administered by the Turkish ministry of religious affairs if they choose to pray at all. The brotherhood being offered is both local and transnational.\n\nThis part of Edirne looks like it was hastily built circa 1955. The concrete buildings go up about six stories and create a funnel around the road out of town. Except for two mosques straddling the thin Tunca River, it is unrecognizable from photographs from the century before, when the road was full of refugees traveling in the other direction. West of the river, it doesn\u2019t look unchanged at all, though that\u2019s obviously not the case. The flat fields seem to be the sort of thing that horsemen once galloped on, tanks might pulverize, and families could sneak through, using its hedgerows as cover. Looking west, it seems suddenly rather arbitrary that the Meri\u00e7 River is the border of Europe, instead of this thinner Tunca or the mighty Danube.\n\nIt also seems quite arbitrary that some grandchildren of Ottoman subjects are European citizens and others are Europe-bound refugees based on the political alliances their grandparents made. After World War I, Turkey was supposed to lose Edirne to the Greeks and Aleppo to the French. Turkish general Mustafa Kemal (soon to be Atat\u00fcrk) demanded the return of the former but not the latter. Part of the deal was that Turkey would exchange its Christian population with Greece\u2019s Muslim population, with some geographical exceptions.\n\nMany of those Muslims put down roots in Edirne, as did their coreligionists from what is now Bulgaria. Their grandchildren are proud of these muhacir roots, but some of the proudest do not see any comparison between their ancestors\u2019 flight and the Syrian issue. Sami G\u00fcltekin, a local historian and founder of the Turkish-Bulgarian-Greek friendship association, stands tall in front of photographs of Muslim refugees from a century prior. Barely sweating from the humidity, he points to the photographs of road-weary migrants. \u201cLook at what we had to deal with,\u201d G\u00fcltekin says as he gestures at a photograph of two lynched men. \u201cWe had so much violence, and we have learned to forgive.\u201d When asked if the intervening decades may have something to do with it, he shrugs. \u201cThe Syrians will not stay. They are just migrants.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Asher Kohn\n\nDefining migrant across the ages is difficult. The Balkan Wars were decades before the United Nations defined what refugees were, what refugees weren\u2019t, and how the world would reckon with something like Syria\u2019s civil war. Europe\u2019s migrant crisis is fueled less by age-old rivalries than by unintended consequences. The most brilliant men of the early 1900s thought that their dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire would save future generations from war, but World War II, the Lebanese Civil War, and now Syria\u2019s show that they are oh-for-three so far in that regard.\n\nIt may feel good to blame some long-dead gentlemen for current-day woes, but that does not precisely help the blond football coach\u2013looking man or his companion in the wheelchair. Ismail Keskin has studied Turkey\u2019s previous refugee crisis and written books about both that one and today\u2019s. He doesn\u2019t feel particularly hopeful, pointing to the refugee camps that dot the European continent and the horror stories that threaten to outweigh the successes: capsized boats off Lampedusa, bodies washed up on the Norwegian coast, a stampede in the Channel Tunnel.\n\nKeskin\u2019s book hinges on a harrowing journey across the Meri\u00e7 River, and a Greek border guard\u2019s memory of his own grandfather\u2019s similar flight. They both knew Edirne only as a place worth getting away from. Surely it\u2019s more than that, and the mosques are gorgeous. The people are friendly. The liver is tasty, if you are into that sort of thing. Edirne is a city of migrants, even if some have only been there for a few moments and others for generations. Some Syrians see it as a place where things can only go wrong, and that should be understandable.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:55:35.122+0000"}
{"entityId": 340, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by shapecharge/Getty Images\n\nFor five years, I watched my best friend die of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a terrible disease that causes one\u2019s muscles to waste away. First he struggled to walk, then to speak, then to breathe. One tube pushed air into his lungs; another pushed nutrients into his stomach. Toward the end, he could only move his eyes. ALS does not affect the brain; through it all, he remained perfectly aware of his slow-motion torture. After years of suffering, he died of respiratory failure, his body skeletal and ravaged, his mind alert to his suffocation until the last moments of life.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nThere is currently no cure for ALS. There will be some day. And that cure may very well be derived from stem cells taken from aborted fetuses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t help but remember that fact when I watch the videos, taken by undercover anti-abortion activists, of Planned Parenthood technicians discussing how to preserve fetal tissue to be donated for research. The graphic images of aborted fetuses are meant to disgust me, to convince me that abortion is a barbaric act of killing. But I don\u2019t see death in these videos. I see hope.\n\nALS kills people by causing their motor neurons to degenerate. These neurons go from the brain to the spinal cord, then travel from the spinal cord to muscles throughout the body. When they degenerate, you lose the ability to control voluntary muscle movement. Eating, talking, swallowing, breathing: All of these functions rely, to some extent, on healthy motor neurons. When you can no longer move a muscle, it atrophies. Eventually, your respiratory muscles can no longer contract, and you suffocate.\n\nStem cells hold terrific promise for the treatment\u2014and, eventually, the defeat\u2014of ALS. The most useful stem cells are found in fertilized embryos and fetuses, where they haven\u2019t yet developed into specialized cells. (Scientists can also reprogram adult cells to act like embryonic stem cells, but these reprogrammed cells, while useful for research, have not been shown to be therapeutically safe.)\n\nA woman\u2019s decision to donate her aborted fetus to medical research is deeply commendable.\n\nThe first Food and Drug Administration\u2013approved clinical trials to treat ALS with fetal stem cells are already underway. Any treatment derived from fetal tissue is many years away at best, but the early research has been a success. Stem cells injected into ALS patients\u2019 spinal cords have survived for years and have caused few side effects. The cells seem to protect diseased motor neurons, stimulating their survival. With motor neurons restored to health, muscle atrophy slows or ceases. The experimental treatment slowed or reversed the progression of the disease in several patients in a small Phase I clinical trial.\n\nOne patient, whose muscles had degenerated to the point that he couldn\u2019t walk without a cane, abandoned his cane months after the trial began. He later participated in a 2.5-mile walkathon. That was in 2011. He remains alive and well today. The treatment also effectively halted disease progression in the other five patients still in the early stages of ALS. It was a stunning leap forward in ALS treatment. A Phase 2 trial, with new patients, further demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the therapy; symptoms improved in seven of 15 patients.\n\nOne of the many discoveries researchers made in preparing for the first trial was that fetal stem cells seemed to be the best stem cells for ALS treatment. After extensive animal testing, researchers found that embryonic stem cells sometimes turned into cancer cells. Fetal stem cells, on the other hand, are older\u2014and thus on their way to an identity. For their trial, researchers used stem cells that were beginning to develop into nerve cells. They didn\u2019t develop into cancer. Instead, they seemed to support dying neurons and restore motor function.\n\nI know about this trial because my friend applied to participate in it. He was turned down: His was deemed too atrophied to be helped. He died shortly after the trial began.\n\nThis research might have been advanced enough to include him if Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush hadn\u2019t banned federal funding for research on fetal tissue from abortions. (The research progressed once Bill Clinton reversed the ban.) More recently, fetal stem cell research has been less controversial than embryonic stem cell research. That may be because fetal stem cells are taken from fetuses that have no more potential for life. Embryonic stem cell research, which generally requires the destruction of the embryo that could theoretically be implanted and develop, has lately drawn much more debate and political attention. Now activists have shifted the attention back to fetal tissue donations, which allows them to show gruesome images of aborted fetuses\u2014a time-worn and very effective anti-abortion strategy.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:55:45.882+0000"}

{"entityId": 343, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Tofik Babayev/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s sweeping, anti-Western crackdown on freedoms in Russia has made headlines everywhere. Government-fomented anti-Western hysteria is at a height not seen since the Soviet era. The government\u2019s witch hunt to ban \u201cundesirable\u201d foreign groups and donors has created a poisonous climate of fear and suspicion.\n\nMore than 1,000 miles south of Moscow, a government-led crackdown is under way in another post-Soviet state, Azerbaijan. It hasn\u2019t garnered the same attention or outrage, but it should, because this new wave of repression has decimated this oil-rich country\u2019s human rights community.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn my 24 years in human rights work in former Soviet countries, I have never seen a government this busy jailing human rights leaders, whose lives\u2014and the lives of their families\u2014are now in ruins. Many activists and dissidents have fled the country. In some cases the government has gone after the family members they\u2019ve left behind.\n\nAzerbaijan has had a consistently poor human rights record, but starting in mid-2012, in an effort to silence independent voices, the Azerbaijani authorities began imprisoning dozens of political activists, human rights defenders, journalists, bloggers, and others on various trumped-up charges, including hooliganism, drug possession, and tax evasion. Like its northern counterpart, the Azerbaijani government adopted legislation that made it extremely difficult for independent organizations or civil society groups to accept foreign funding.\n\nThen, in spring and summer 2014, the crackdown hardened. Unlike Russia, the Azerbaijani government didn\u2019t bother with first mobilizing the public through campaigns around \u201cundesirable organizations\u201d or \u201cforeign agents.\u201d It went right for the jugular: It opened criminal investigations against several international donors, froze the accounts of dozens of independent groups that had been their grantees, and arrested the country\u2019s most fiercely independent and outspoken activist leaders.\n\nIt\u2019s been a year since the authorities arrested Leyla Yunus, who has been among the country\u2019s most prominent human rights figures for two decades, and her husband, Arif Yunus. In rapid succession they arrested Rasul Jafarov, who led campaigns to leverage Azerbaijan\u2019s hosting of such mega-events as the European Games and the Eurovision Song Contest to generate pressure to end politically motivated prosecutions. They jailed Intigam Aliyev, who pioneered human rights litigation in Azerbaijan, including at the European Court of Human Rights. A few months later, they arrested Khadija Ismayilova, the country\u2019s leading investigative journalist.\n\nAll remain behind bars. In the past few days, they have each appeared in court, in a rapid, revolving door of show trials. On July 21, Aliyev and Jafarov appealed their convictions on tax evasion and other economic crimes. Aliyev\u2019s appeal was rejected and his seven-and-a-half\u2013year prison sentence remains unchanged. Jafarov\u2019s sentence was reduced by three months, to six years and three months.* On July 25, preliminary hearings began in Ismayilova\u2019s trial, also on tax evasion, embezzlement, and other economic infractions. And hearings on the merits started on July 27 against Leyla and Arif Yunus, also on similar charges. The couple has also been charged with treason, but those charges will be heard separately. In hearings this week, the authorities allowed very few journalists and diplomatic representatives into the courtroom.\n\nWhy did the Azerbaijani government choose this moment to radically clamp down and transform its civil society? The government started the crackdown in the wake of the 2011 Arab Spring, fearing the example it might set in this largely secular Muslim country. The 2013\u20132014 Maidan revolt in Ukraine, another post-Soviet state, almost certainly exacerbated those fears. Rather than address the root causes of potential public discontent\u2014chief among them grotesque, epic corruption\u2014the authorities went after people who give voice to discontent. It\u2019s a sadly predictable strategy. And maybe Russia\u2019s example emboldened the authorities in Baku.\n\nBut maybe the more compelling answer is, simply: Why not? As the Azerbaijani government ratcheted up the arrests and repression, it faced no consequences. At the height of the crackdown, as the government was arresting the country\u2019s human rights leaders, Azerbaijan proudly held the rotating chairmanship of the Council of Europe, Europe\u2019s intergovernmental human rights organization.\n\nThat is starting to change. In June, 25 states joined at the United Nations Human Rights Council to issue a statement marking concern about the crackdown and calling for the release of arrested human rights defenders, marking the first time Azerbaijan has been singled out in this way at the United Nations. The same week, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe also condemned the crackdown and called for it to end. In April the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which promotes good governance of resource-rich countries by fostering open public debate, demoted Azerbaijan because of the government\u2019s failure to abide by the group\u2019s rules, which require respect for fundamental freedoms.\n\nThe Azerbaijani government can stop this pressure at any time: It can free human-rights defenders and government critics held on politically motivated charges.\n\nBut until it does, more international action is needed, sustained over time, and across other multilateral organizations that have human-rights\u2013related rules that Azerbaijan is so flagrantly breaking. Each should use the tools available\u2014including more statements, the threat of exclusion from prestigious bodies, and the like\u2014to maximize pressure on Baku and alter the government\u2019s apparent calculation that it can carry on with its brutal crackdown at no price.\n\nMeanwhile, foreign embassies and representatives of intergovernmental organizations in Baku should all send representatives to these court hearings. That would deny the Azerbaijani government the opportunity to intimidate those who do. But more important, it would show moral support for the Yunuses, Rasul Jafarov, Intigam Aliyev, and Khadija Ismayilova, who have done so much to support the values that people who cherish their freedom and human rights hold dear.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:56:01.089+0000"}

Photos by Thinkstock.\n\nThis article originally appeared in Inside Higher Ed.\n\nConventional wisdom holds that in bad economic times, students are more likely to make academic decisions that favor fields perceived to be paths to jobs, and jobs that pay well. Despite plenty of evidence that liberal arts graduates also have successful careers, undergraduates (and their parents) tend in tough times to encourage majors in business and engineering or other fields that seem to promise employment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nA new paper backs up that conventional wisdom with precise data on how high unemployment rates shift students\u2019 majors. While both male and female students shift, they do so in different ways. And they both move away from the liberal arts and education when unemployment goes up.\n\nIn total, the paper estimates that every increase of 1 percent in the unemployment rate prompts a 3.2 percentage point reallocation of the major choices of men, and 4.1 percentage points for women. In periods of significant increases in unemployment rates, the consequences could be significant for many students\u2019 enrollment patterns.\n\nThe study (available here) was done by Erica Blom, a consultant with Edgeworth Economics; Brian C. Candena, assistant professor of economics at the University of Colorado\u2013Boulder; and Benjamin Keys, assistant professor at the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago. The study was published by the Institute for the Study of Labor, a German research center known as IZA, but the research is about American students\u2014and in particular those of traditional college age.\n\nThe scholars used two major national databases\u2014the American Community Survey and the Baccalaureate and Beyond Survey\u2014to examine the relationship between the choices of major for people aged 20, and how those choices shift as unemployment rates go up. The database created for the research covers Americans who turned 20 from 1960 through 2011.\n\nThe results suggest that even brief recessions can have a long-lasting impact.\n\nTheir findings show that the share of men majoring in engineering fields goes up by more than 0.6 percent every time the unemployment rate increases by 1 percent. Other majors that show gains in the share of men include accounting (more than 0.2 percent for every point that the unemployment rate is up), and business (excluding finance), computer science and natural science (all up by more than 0.1 percent). Men respond to increases in the unemployment rates by shifting away from (in order of magnitude of the shift) education, liberal arts and history, literature and language, psychology, and sociology. (Complete charts may be found at the end of this article.)\n\nFor women, the field seeing the greatest increase for each point of unemployment goes up is business outside of finance, by more than 0.6 percent. That is followed by nursing (about half the gain of business), accounting, technical health fields, and computer-related fields. Women are most likely to move away from education (by more than 1 percent share of women\u2019s enrollment if counting all education fields together), literature and language, sociology, psychology, and liberal arts and history.\n\nMany of the shifts by women bring them out of fields traditionally dominated by women and into those that have been overwhelmingly male. But traditional gender patterns can also be evident. While women showed a significant increase in nursing majors (a field where jobs are plentiful), men saw only marginal gains.\n\nSome fields showing marginal gains (for men and women)\u2014such as journalism and pre-law\u2014haven\u2019t been great job producers of late.\n\nIn explaining their findings, the authors write that \u201crecessions lead to share increases among more difficult and male-dominated majors, even controlling for differences in earnings and the likelihood of finding employment. These additional results suggest that in response to anticipated weak labor demand upon graduation, students either devote more resources to learning about the career potential of majors or become more sensitive to the signal that their major sends about their ability to potential employers. The stark responsiveness to the business cycle suggests that many college students, and especially female college students, have sufficient ability to complete more challenging majors, such as [those in] STEM fields, yet choose not to do so in periods with stronger labor market prospects.\u201d\n\nFrom a purely financial perspective, the authors write that the students are making wise choices, and that they are shifting toward fields whose graduates, on average, earn more. At the same time, the income shift (as a percentage) is modest.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:56:03.937+0000"}

He lives in Iowa City.\n\nIt turns out, though, that drawing straws for the final few spots on stage could actually be fairer than what will actually happen next Tuesday at Fox News HQ. It would certainly be more transparent. As New York magazine\u2019s Gabriel Sherman points out, with less than a week to go before the field is set, the conservative cable network hasn\u2019t specifically said how it will go about deciding which polls it will use and which it will ignore. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what methodology they\u2019re going to use,\u201d one concerned John Kasich adviser told Sherman. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking the question and they haven\u2019t shared.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe most specific criterion the network has offered publicly to date is that its polling experts will select \u201cthe five most recent national polls, as recognized by Fox News\u201d\u2014a statement that effectively says that Fox News will pick the polls that Fox News picks. This isn\u2019t a minor point: With the bottom half of the GOP field so tightly packed and with so much variability from one poll to the next, if Fox execs wait until the last moment, they won\u2019t be picking polls\u2014they\u2019ll be selecting candidates. And as the head of a cable network that thrives on conservative chaos, Fox News chief Roger Ailes is hardly a disinterested observer. Worse still, Ailes is making those decisions in secret while hiding behind the polls in public.\n\nHere\u2019s more from Sherman, who literally wrote the book on Fox News:\n\nInside Fox, the debate is generating controversy among Ailes\u2019s senior ranks. \u201cThere\u2019s total confusion about all of it. The Second Floor is making it up as they go along,\u201d one Fox personality told me, referring to Ailes\u2019s executive suite. According to sources, Fox executives are still undecided about which polls to use and who will be allowed on the stage. \u2026 Even inside Fox, some are awed that a presidential race is being influenced by a television channel. \u201cCrazy stuff,\u201d another personality told me, \u201cyou have a TV executive deciding who is in \u2014 and out \u2014 of a debate!\u201d\n\nThe stakes are particularly high for Kasich, Rick Perry, and Chris Christie, who currently have the best chances of snagging one of the final two spots on the main stage. For them, a few points in a single poll could mean the difference between getting the opportunity for a breakout on the main stage and being forced to sit awkwardly at the losers forum during what could be the beginning of the end for campaigns that have barely began. Of course, candidates who miss out on the debate will have good reason to direct their anger elsewhere: Fox News is sure to be hiring again soon.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:56:09.894+0000"}

It dates back to the early days of\u2014naturally\u2014the Clinton administration, when Hillary Clinton, on the advice of pal Barbra Streisand, began to see one Cristophe of Beverly Hills, who charged her $200 (or about $330 in 2015 dollars). By the time Bill decided to do the same, Hillary had moved on to New York\u2019s Frederic Fekkai at $275 ($454 in 2015).\n\nThen, in May 1993, Bill Clinton received what \u201cmay have been the most expensive haircut in history,\u201d as Thomas Friedman speculated in the New York Times. The dubious story was that Air Force One tied up traffic at LAX in 1993 solely so the presidential locks could receive a $200 coif. The press went insane over \u201cHairgate,\u201d even though the cut resulted in no actual delays on any commercial airlines. Controversial beauty treatments would continue to haunt the Clintons. In 1994, there was gossip claiming that Hillary Clinton did not tip after a visit to Gessner & Camp, a Coral Gables, Florida, salon, while Tipper Gore supposedly left a $90 gratuity.\n\nWe went about a decade without a Hairgate, a drought finally relieved during the 2004 presidential race by Matt Drudge, who outed John Kerry for flying Cristophe employee Isabelle Goetz from Washington to Pittsburgh. (It should come as no surprise to discover that Hillary Clinton was also reported to be a Goetz client.)\n\nAnd then there was John Edwards. Long rumored to be vain about his plentiful locks, he was caught paying for $400 haircuts at Beverly Hills\u2019 Torrenueva Salon, a crime no one ever would have known about had he not listed them on his candidate expense filings. (He later reimbursed his campaign.) Maureen Dowd, among others, went to town, stating more than a bit prophetically, \u201cAll the haircuts in the world may not save John Edwards from a blowout.\u201d (The last salon Edwards was spotted patronizing was a North Carolina SuperCuts, which charges $12.95 for a styling.)\n\nRepublicans have been largely immune: No one made much of a fuss when first lady Laura Bush reportedly received a clipping from one Sally Hershberger, who charged $700. An exception, as it so often is, came in the highly flammable form of Sarah Palin, who in 2008 ran up a bill in the tens of thousands of dollars for traveling with not only a hairstylist but a makeup artist (the latter was Emmy-nominated for her work on So You Think You Can Dance?).\n\nClearly, women are in a bind here, as likely to be judged for not primping as for expensively primping. Just last week, Hillary Clinton took a question in a Facebook forum about the \u201chair and makeup tax\u201d that women pay for their upkeep\u2014a tax on both their wallets and their time.\n\nBut when it comes to Hairgates past and present, men\u2014or at least male Democrats\u2014are as likely to get dinged for their choices as women.

It was a clear step away from the familiar description of a dearly departed\u2019s \u201cbattle\u201d with the disease. But did this euphemism attenuate cancer in a way that felt cruel to the victim or untrue to the actual experience of, well, dying? I imagined a man walking slowly into the sunset, hand in hand with an adumbral figure. It seemed strange that the two silhouettes were moving in the same direction.\n\nKaty Waldman Katy Waldman is Slate\u2019s words correspondent.\n\nA journey \u201cthrough\u201d cancer might have been easier to visualize. There goes Rees, gracefully picking his way across the changing landscape, its rocks and eddies of sand and occasional sloping idylls. You are now entering cancer, reads the road sign behind him. Do not expect to enjoy your stay. But that preposition might be inapt, given that not every itinerant reaches the other side of the imperial malady. With, then, not through.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAnd this is good, I think. The metaphors of choice for cancer have long been battle, war, or fight. As physician Dhruv Khullar pointed out, John Donne had already begun to entwine martial and medical imagery in the 17th century: The \u201csiege\u201d of sickness, Donne said, \u201cwill blow up the heart, like a Myne\u2026it batters all, overthrowes all, demolishes all, destroyes us in an instant.\u201d* (In this respect, sickness is not unlike Donne\u2019s God, whom the poet famously implored to \u201cbatter [his] heart.\u201d) Donne\u2019s contemporary Thomas Sydenham, a doctor known as \u201cEngland\u2019s Hippocrates,\u201d fulminated that \u201ca murderous array of disease must be fought against, and the battle is not a battle for the sluggard.\u201d Perhaps the idea of doctors nobly defending their patients against malign invaders grates less than the imperative that sick people\u2014who didn\u2019t choose this, who have no training\u2014must themselves suit up for war. But by now, the distinction doesn\u2019t matter. Military lenses for the viewing of bodily ills and betrayals have become standard-issue. (Susan Sontag explored this issue in depth with her book AIDS and Its Metaphors.) The observation seems true for the cancer community especially, where a U.K. research organization made \u201cTogether we will beat cancer\u201d its motto, and Lance Armstrong reduced his experience of the disease to a stark dichotomy: \u201cGive up or fight like hell.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s changed isn\u2019t the prevalence of martial rhetoric\u2014it\u2019s that the culture has filled up with supplementary voices decrying the analogy. I\u2019ve written before on how pressuring cancer patients to embody our fond hopes for human fortitude amounts to exploiting people at their most vulnerable. Many feel that likening sick men and women to soldiers places an unfair burden on them: If they \u201close,\u201d were they just not fighting hard enough? This framing is insane not only because cancer has no cure, but because it allows us to freight the very ill with expectations we wouldn\u2019t dream of taking up ourselves. Who with a life-threatening illness has the time or emotional space to keep all of our heroic fantasies alive, too? As Aria Jones memorably promised in McSweeney\u2019s, \u201cIf I die of this relapsed, refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia, and you describe me posthumously as having \u2018lost her battle with cancer,\u2019 I swear to God I will come back from wherever my soul may have been sent and haunt the living shit out of you for the rest of your days.\u201d\n\nScience backs up the toxicity of the war metaphor. In several studies, patients primed to think of their cancer as an adversary reported more guilt, higher levels of depression and anxiety, and elevated pain. Furthermore, researchers at the University of Michigan found that \u201cbellicose\u201d medical rhetoric led people to understand cancer as an enemy to be resisted, not a condition susceptible to judicious lifestyle shifts. Accordingly, participants who received a cancer pamphlet salted with words like hostile and fight proved less likely to cut back on cigarettes or red meat.\n\nStill: I get it. The cancer-as-villain trope can simplify the emotional terrain for patients at a messy, bewildering time; some may find it helpful or consoling to connect their ordeal to higher values like courage, grit, and resilience. Plus, the battle rhetoric has social utility: \u201cSince 1971,\u201d explained Khullar, \u201cwhen President Nixon declared a \u2018War on Cancer,\u2019 this imagery has been effective for inspiring the fervor and funds necessary for great advances in cancer care and research.\u201d\n\nJourney, not nearly so grand or stirring, has a gentler virtue. Instead of focusing on outcomes\u2014triumph or defeat\u2014the word zeroes in on the everyday process of managing a chronic illness. It replaces the agon with mindfulness, a sensitivity to one\u2019s needs and feelings, an understanding that the scenery might change. Writing for the Guardian, health care worker (and terminal patient) Kate Granger demonstrated the need for this softer, more variable discourse:\n\nSome days cancer has the upper hand, other days I do. I live with it and I let its physical and emotional effects wash over me. But I don't fight it. After all, cancer has arisen from within my own body, from my own cells. To fight it would be \"waging a war\" on myself.\n\nGranger\u2019s point, that cancer and person form an uneasy synthesis, is echoed by my colleague Jacob Brogan, who has written that the malady can feel less like a terrifying antagonist than a quiet roommate, an eerie presence whose rhythms sometimes merge with yours. This evokes some of the more recent thinking about the disease, as unspooled in books like Siddhartha Mukherjee\u2019s The Emperor of All Maladies and Atul Gawande\u2019s Being Mortal. Noting that tumor cells thrive by perfecting and magnifying the activities of nontumor cells, Mukherjee calls cancer \u201can enigmatic, if somewhat deranged, image in the mirror.\u201d Reviewing the book in Slate, Amanda Schaffer termed cancer \u201cour evil, smarter twin.\u201d Meanwhile, Gawande asks readers to think carefully about the costs of a protracted, uncertain campaign against the illness, one that could more closely resemble a civil war than a foreign offensive.\n\nIf fights are unnatural events, incidents of overturned expectation, journeys seem constant and inevitable. We\u2019ve worked the imagery of embarkations, milestones, resting points, and destinations deep into our symbolic understanding of a life, so it makes sense to regard cancer as one more leg of the journey. Discourse around the Crab once drew on the Iliad; now it takes cues from the Odyssey. And for all the shivery valor of the first epic, maybe it\u2019s worth remembering that the second one had the more satisfying ending.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:56:24.215+0000"}

{"entityId": 351, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Earlier this spring, there seemed to be signs that young adults were finally shaking off the effects of our long-ago recession and moving out from their parents' basements. Namely, the pace of U.S. household formation was speeding up, which is generally a sign that twentysomethings are setting off on their own.\n\nBut maybe not so much. Today, the Pew Research Center is out with a new analysis of census data suggesting that young adults haven't really changed their ways. The job market might be getting better by the month, but millennials are still very much living at home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFirst, the very big picture. Since 2010, unemployment among 18-to-34-year-olds has fallen significantly. And yet the fraction of that group living independently, meaning not with a parent or relative, has also declined.\n\nNow let's drill down a little more. Pew was kind enough to send me its numbers broken down into smaller age groups\u201418-to-24-year-olds (with full-time college students excluded) and 25-to-34-year-olds. In the first three months of 2015, it seems, the percentage of younger millennials living at home shrank a bit. For older millennials, it rose. Pew cautions that, because of seasonal issues, numbers from this past winter might not be 100 percent comparable with full-year data from 2014. But still, there's no real sign that the 25-to-34 group is leaving the nest.\n\nJordan Weissmann*\n\nAnd honestly, nobody is entirely sure why they haven't yet. There are theories, of course. Some studies have blamed student debt, though that doesn't really explain why non-college-goers are also living at home at higher rates. Others suggest the fact that young people now get married later than they used to may be responsible. To me, it seems blindingly obvious that the fact that rents are rising faster than wages in much of the country has something to do with it, though I haven't seen a rigorous analysis testing that theory. (But, seriously, 46 percent of 25-to-34-year-olds were rent-burdened in 2013, up from 40 percent in 2003.

Photos by STF/AFP/Getty Images and Universal History Archive/Getty Images.\n\nOn Feb. 20, 1958, in the midst of an escalating number of nuclear weapons tests worldwide\u201425 in 1955, 55 in 1957, nearly 120 in 1958\u2014two scientists met in San Francisco for a live televised debate over nuclear weapons testing, fallout, and disarmament. In front of big block letters reading KQED, the call sign of the public television station, sat Linus Pauling, the 1954 Nobel laureate in chemistry and a compelling voice in the push for world peace through nuclear disarmament. To his left was physicist Edward Teller, looking comfortable and confident. Teller helped build the atomic bombs detonated over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and did work on the more powerful hydrogen bomb. He supported constructing increasingly powerful weapons to deter nuclear war with the Soviets.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSince this debate aired nearly 60 years ago, the spectacle of scientists dueling in public over matters of political disagreement has become commonplace. Experts line up on opposing sides of a widening array of policy debates around issues as diverse as climate change, genetically modified crops, food and nutrition, and K\u201312 education. The experts speak as scientists. But very often they also speak on behalf of one political position or another. As a result of such advocacy, the line between science and politics seems to be growing more and more blurry.\n\nWhen the politics are divisive and the science is complicated and uncertain, scientists should help the public come to terms with complex and difficult dilemmas. Their approaches for helping us to make decisions can include advocacy, analysis, and education. Today, scientists may\u2014intentionally or not \u2014blend analytical or educational approaches with advocacy, thus furthering perceived entanglements of science and politics. This situation is quite different from the picture we get when we look back to a time when such debates were much less familiar, scientists were mostly in the background of political processes, and the authority of science was much less wrapped up in its role in public controversies.\n\nOn that night in 1958, the television camera first focused on the moderator sitting between the two scientists. \u201cWe in the United States bear an enormous burden in the decisions which must be made,\u201d he began, referring to society\u2019s questions about how to handle nuclear weapons. \u201cIn an effort to sharpen the focus \u2026 two of the world\u2019s leading scientists agreed to debate the issue of \u2018Fallout and Disarmament.\u2019 Each speaks from personal convictions based upon experience, thoughtful consideration, and a profound knowledge of the subtleties involved.\u201d\n\nThe line between science and politics seems to be growing more and more blurry.\n\nPauling, wearing a suit tailored to fit his thin frame, spoke first. A week shy of his 57th birthday, the top of his head was practically bald and gray hair curled around his ears. Pauling had begun giving lectures about the science of atomic weapons after the United States used the bombs on Japan in 1945. By the end of the 1940s, he had shifted to speaking about the dangers of atomic weapons, always keeping his presentations up to date with the latest scientific advances and political developments.\n\nPlacing both hands flatly on the table in front of him, Pauling leaned forward and looked straight into the television camera. \u201cI am a scientist. I am interested in the world, this wonderful world we live in.\u201d He seemed a bit uncomfortable and he hesitated slightly. \u201cAnd I am especially interested in human beings.\u201d With this line, his demeanor relaxed.\n\n\u201cWe must not have a nuclear war. We must begin to solve international disputes by the application of man\u2019s power of reason in a way that is worthy of the dignity of man.\u201d With each must, Pauling\u2019s voice got louder. \u201cWe must solve them by arbitration, negotiation, the development of international law, the making of international agreements that will do justice to all nations and to all people\u2014will benefit all nations and all peoples. And now is the time to start.\u201d\n\nOne month before this, Pauling and his wife, Ava Helen, had traveled to New York and presented a petition to the head of the United Nations. The day after their U.N. visit, the front page of the New York Times reported \u201c9,000 Scientists of 43 Lands Ask Nuclear Bomb Tests Be Stopped.\u201d\n\nBut not all scientists thought nuclear testing should be stopped. Teller and Albert L. Latter, also a nuclear weapons expert, challenged the petition in an article they published in Life magazine. The story\u2019s subheading blared: \u201cFather of H-Bomb and Colleague Answer Nine Thousand Scientists: Fallout Risk is Overrated.\u201d\n\nIn their Life article, Teller and Latter cited scientists who concluded that background radiation bombarding the planet from the sun and X-rays from procedures at doctors\u2019 offices were more dangerous than nuclear weapons tests. Teller and Latter used this information to claim that the chances of contracting leukemia or bone cancer from fallout were negligible.\n\nDuring the debate, Pauling turned to a copy of Teller\u2019s Life article. \u201cI should like to read a statement in this article,\u201d Pauling said, putting on his glasses. He began reading: \u201c \u2018Since the people are the sovereign power in a democracy, it is of the greatest importance that they should be honestly and completely informed about all the relevant facts.\u2019 \u201d He read each word with deliberation, and then said that Life readers \u201care not honestly informed or completely informed by this article.\u201d Pauling proceeded to read several passages of the article, many relating to the potential health impacts of radiation, that he deemed \u201cnot true\u201d and \u201cseriously misleading.\u201d\n\nPauling finished his presentation with some science of radiation that he hoped would help viewers understand the magnitude of the dangers from fallout. He recited memorized estimates that 15,000 children yearly would be affected by disease-causing genetic mutations should nuclear testing continue at the current rate and noted that \u201cthere are serious effects on the health of human beings now living.\u201d\n\nPauling\u2019s dark eyebrows rose in emphasis, and he rarely turned his eyes away from the television camera. \u201cThis is the opinion that I and many of my scientific colleagues\u2014a great many\u2014have.\u201d He smiled slightly and nodded in satisfaction as he reached the end of his opening statement.\n\nTeller had a different strategy for his opening statement. \u201cI would like to emphasize at the outset that there are many, many facts about which Dr. Pauling and I agree,\u201d 50-year-old Teller stated in a thick Hungarian accent. His relaxed demeanor and slightly disheveled appearance made him appear more avuncular and approachable than Pauling. \u201cNow, the first points about which I would like to agree very strongly with Dr. Pauling are his quest for peace and his great appreciation for human life.\u201d\n\nThe camera cut to Pauling, who stood with back straight, brow furrowed, and lips pursed.\n\n\u201cWe are playing for big stakes,\u201d Teller continued solemnly. \u201cWe are playing not only for our lives, we are playing for something more. We are playing for freedom, for our own freedom, for the freedom of our friends and allies.\u201d Siding with the U.S. government\u2019s nuclear policy of deterrence, he believed that force was the best way to maintain freedom and eventually achieve an international agreement. Disarmament stripped nations of their ability to retaliate. It had allowed Adolf Hitler and the Nazis to occupy Teller\u2019s homeland.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:57:56.114+0000"}

That, to put it mildly, is less than a scientific process: As plenty of pollsters have noted, it\u2019s almost akin to drawing straws for the final few spots. Nonetheless, those are the rules Fox News came up with, and those are the rules the Republican Party signed off on\u2014so those are the rules we have.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nIn theory, a candidate could survive being left out of the main event and still catch fire, either at the televised GOP kids\u2019 table that will precede the debate or on the trail later. In reality, though, it would take a minor miracle for any of them to convince voters, donors, and the media that they\u2019re worth the attention moving forward. Given that, what happens over the next seven days should provide the first major winnowing of a campaign that is still six months away from its first official nominating contest. Here\u2019s a quick rundown of where things stand heading into the home stretch. (We\u2019ll continue to update this post between now and decision day as major news warrants.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n1.) Donald Trump\n\nRealClearPolling average: 18.2 percent\n\nDebate status: Lock.\n\nMuch to the dismay of the GOP establishment, The Donald is very much still around. Even his real-war-heroes-don\u2019t-get-captured shtick hasn\u2019t derailed his campaign. He\u2019s finished atop five of the six most recent national polls, and placed a close second in the other. The laws of politics (and general decorum) have yet to catch up with Trump; they\u2019re unlikely to before next Tuesday.\n\n2.) Jeb Bush\n\nRCP average: 13.7 percent\n\nDebate status: Lock\n\nBush was expected to run a shock-and-awe campaign that would clear a crowded field. His massive fundraising totals aside, though, the biggest shock of his campaign has been how little he\u2019s controlled the race. Still, the former Florida governor remains the establishment favorite and has continued to poll in the top-three pretty much all year long. Trump may be stealing the spotlight but he doesn\u2019t appear to be actually stealing Jeb\u2019s support.\n\n3.) Scott Walker\n\nRCP average: 11.7 percent\n\nDebate status: Lock\n\nWalker would prefer the national conversation was focused on Iowa, which will hold the first nominating contest of 2016 and where the Wisconsin governor currently sits atop the polls. But Walker remains safely in the top-tier in the national surveys. In the past six polls, Walker has three second-place finishes to his name.\n\n4.) Marco Rubio\n\nRCP average: 6.8 percent\n\nDebate status: Near-Lock\n\nThe final member of the GOP establishment\u2019s Big Three, Rubio hasn\u2019t exactly lived up to that title. The Florida senator hasn\u2019t been able to keep pace with Bush and Walker in the polls and currently finds himself at the top of the main heap. Still, with his name recognition and perceived frontrunner status, Rubio will have the chance in Cleveland to right the ship.\n\n5.) Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson\n\nRCP average: 6.0 percent a piece\n\nDebate status: Safe\n\nTwo favorites of the Evangelical set, Huckabee and Carson have remained in the thick of the nominating contest for months. Carson has done so rather quietly, winning over voters at GOP cattle calls and on conservative media. Huckabee, meanwhile, has begun to make as much noise as he possibly can\u2014even if that means adding his own corollary to Godwin\u2019s Law in the process.\n\n7.) Ted Cruz and Rand Paul\n\nRCP average: 5.7 percent a piece\n\nDebate status: Safe\n\nBoth senators have yet to live up to the hype that preceded their presidential campaigns\u2014and both have turned increasingly desperate to stand out in a crowded field that continues to be dominated by Trump. Cruz has tried to buddy up with the billionaire frontrunner, while simultaneously lobbing bombs at his own party\u2019s establishment on the Senate floor. Paul, meanwhile, has proved he\u2019s willing to do just about anything short of setting himself on fire to get some of the attention being bestowed upon Trump. So far, though, stunts like taking a chainsaw to the U.S. tax code haven\u2019t been able to steal the show from a professional showman.\n\n9.) Chris Christie\n\nRCP average: 3.0 percent\n\nDebate status: Nervous\n\nFour years ago, GOP powerbrokers were begging for the New Jersey governor to make a White House run. This year? Not so much. Bridgegate didn\u2019t help things, but neither has his shifting position on Common Core or his moderate position on climate change. Two months ago he seemed like a safe bet to be on stage in Cleveland, but now he has his work cut out for him.\n\n10.) John Kasich\n\nRCP average: 2.2 percent\n\nDebate status: Nervous\n\nKasich may have timed his official launch perfectly. Less than three weeks ago the Ohio governor sat three places and about two points away from snagging the final invite to a primetime event in his own backyard. Thanks to a post-announcement bump, he\u2019s since inched into the top ten with less than a week to go. Helping his cause: A recent surge in New Hampshire, which may earn him some valuable free media over the next week.\n\n11.) Rick Perry\n\nRCP average: 2.0 percent\n\nDebate status: Desperate\n\nPerry is in real danger of missing out on the debate stage. Of the entire field, he\u2019s been the most willing to go directly after Trump, calling the reality TV star a \u201ccancer on conservatism.\u201d Unless he finds some late momentum, though, the former Texas governor might be left to watch from home and yell insults at his television. The good news for Perry? If he misses out on the debate he\u2019ll be spared reliving his \u201cOops\u201d debacle from four years ago on a continuous cable news loop next week.\n\n12-13.) Rick Santorum, Bobby Jindal, Carly Fiorina\n\nRCP average: 1.5 percent, 1.3 percent, 1.3 percent respectively\n\nDebate status: Never Say Never\n\nAll three are within one percentage point of the all-important tenth place\u2014but time isn\u2019t on their side. None have managed to really catch fire, even briefly, during the early campaign, and it\u2019s unclear how they might pull off the trick before the buzzer sounds. Still, they\u2019ll certainly try given a few points in a single poll this week could decide their respective fates. Watch out for something big from one or more of them in the next couple of days.\n\n15.)

{"entityId": 357, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images\n\nOn Sunday, Hillary Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination for president, released her first policy proposals on climate change\u2014and at first glance, the Clinton plan seems ambitious. It secures the Obama administration\u2019s gains on renewable energy and, as my Slate colleague Josh Voorhees writes, provides a \u201csolid start\u201d to take them significantly forward. It is great to hear Clinton call global warming an \u201curgent challenge that threatens us all.\u201d\n\nBut is the new Clinton climate plan ambitious enough according to the science? Not really.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nLike many of his colleagues, climate scientist Kevin Anderson has argued that since there\u2019s only a finite amount of carbon that can be emitted before the world is committed to \u201cdangerous\u201d climate change, and we\u2019ve waited so long for serious climate policies, a \u201cwar-like\u201d mobilization is now required. International equity\u2014letting poor countries emit more carbon than rich countries from here on out\u2014demands that the United States, Europe, and other historically high emitting countries should position themselves for at least 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. With Obama at the helm, the U.S. is on pace for reductions of just 43 percent by then. Clinton\u2019s new plan is consistent with a reduction of about 54 percent by 2030.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Clinton\u2019s plan is a significant improvement from Obama\u2019s, but when compared to her two principal challengers, Clinton\u2019s climate goals don\u2019t look so grand. Emily Atkin from Climate Progress has a worthwhile analysis of climate policy statements so far from Clinton, Bernie Sanders, and Martin O\u2019Malley, concluding that O\u2019Malley\u2019s statements rise to the top. I\u2019ve gone a step further and tried to assign likely nationwide greenhouse gas emissions totals for the major plans on the table right now:\n\nBarack Obama\u2019s Climate Action Plan, which includes his Clean Power Plan targets.\n\nClinton\u2019s Clean Energy Challenge, announced Sunday.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 probable plan. Sanders hasn\u2019t announced a comprehensive climate proposal yet, but he\u2019s aligned himself in the past with ideas put forward by climate scientist James Hansen, whose 350 parts per million goal by 2100 includes massive reforestation and other \u201csoft geoengineering\u201d proposals.\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley\u2019s goal to fully power the United States by renewable energy by 2050.\n\nIf you agree that climate change is the singular foreign policy issue of the 21st century\u2014an \u201cexistential threat\u201d as Clinton called it recently, the O\u2019Malley plan is almost a perfect example of what going all in looks like. While such a plan is technically possible, emissions reductions that drastic would almost certainly require a willing Congress at the president\u2019s disposal\u2014most notably to put a price on carbon that motivates the private sector\u2014and even then, it\u2019s still an open question of whether full decarbonization by 2050 is possible given the heroic social and political change it would require at the same time. (David Roberts recently had an excellent examination of this at Vox.)\n\nTo be fair, as a Clinton fact sheet promises, Sunday\u2019s announcement is only the first prong of her forthcoming comprehensive six-prong climate plan, so there will be much more to analyze in the coming weeks. But digging into the numbers, Clinton\u2019s plan barely moves the needle forward.\n\nOn day one, Clinton says, she\u2019d put the U.S. on a path for a seven-fold increase in solar power, which would help usher in enough renewable energy to completely power all homes by 2027. What she doesn\u2019t say is that her plan is voluntary, and would probably require more policy changes than she\u2019s introduced to make it happen.\n\n@bradplumer @EricHolthaus I also will marry Kate Upton by 2027 \u2014 Nick Graham (@nlgraham1) July 27, 2015\n\nEssentially, Clinton is proposing to continue a nationwide exponential uptake in solar. That assumes continuing declining costs for solar power and clean energy tax breaks that don\u2019t expire. As Greentech Media points out, even with Clinton\u2019s lofty goals, the total amount of installed solar power in the U.S. would grow at a slightly slower rate in Clinton\u2019s first term than it\u2019s on pace to during Obama\u2019s second term. O\u2019Malley and Sanders are much more ambitious than Clinton on climate, even allowing for these uncertainties.\n\nAlthough solar often gets top billing in political announcements like Clinton\u2019s, it still represents less than 1 percent of our electricity generation, so it will take tremendous growth for many years for it to provide a meaningful offset to fossil fuels. Despite its sexiness, solar is among the most expensive ways to decrease our country\u2019s carbon footprint. A far better near-term choice is wind power, but both wind and solar begin to have another problem at scales at or above that which Clinton is discussing: Since solar panels and wind turbines can\u2019t currently work at full capacity 24 hours a day, they require huge advances in energy storage and grid capacity, as well. California is already running into this problem as it prepares to implement a plan to derive 50 percent of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. Earlier this year, China was forced to idle about 9 percent of its solar capacity because of storage and grid issues.\n\nClinton says she wants to turn America into the \u201cworld\u2019s clean energy superpower.\u201d But you can\u2019t get there by continuing to support fossil fuel drilling on public lands. Clinton\u2019s video laying out her plan includes imagery of the Apollo moon landing and the World War II flag-raising at Iwo Jima. But Clinton\u2019s plan is not a war-like clean energy mobilization. It\u2019s about what could be expected from an establishment candidate that believes human-caused climate change is a growing threat to global stability, but nowhere near what science and international equity dictates is necessary.\n\nClinton says she'll lay out a plan for \"safe and responsible\" fossil fuel production.

At that point, fewer Americans will enjoy the stability of a full-time job.

His lawyers are also reportedly pushing President Obama to grant him clemency so he can leave the country\u2014presumably for Israel.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nIsrael has long pressed for Pollard\u2019s release, and it has been floated as a bargaining chip frequently over the years, whenever the U.S. wants a concession from the Israeli government. Pollard\u2019s release was reportedly part of a package proposed by Secretary of State John Kerry last year in an unsuccessful attempt to salvage Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. U.S. intelligence leaders have long balked at the idea of releasing Pollard\u2014then-CIA Director George Tenet threatened to quit when Bill Clinton considered it in 1998.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhen the Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Obama administration was preparing to release Pollard, it looked like another trial balloon. Officials denied that there was any link between Pollard\u2019s case and the Iran deal. It\u2019s true that Pollard was eligible for parole in November, so his release doesn\u2019t exactly come out of nowhere\u2014but still, it would be a remarkable coincidence if the U.S. finally agreed to a longtime Israeli demand at a time when relations between the two allies are at a nadir and Israel is lobbying for Congress to reject Obama\u2019s Iran deal.\n\nStill, if this is an olive branch to Israel, it\u2019s unlikely to be a very effective one. Much as he may want Pollard released, Benjamin Netanyahu seems unlikely to soften his position on a deal he views\u2014or says he views\u2014as an existential threat to Israel. As for Republicans in Congress, while they may support Pollard\u2019s release, Lindsey Graham likely spoke for most of his colleagues when he characterized the Pollard release as \u201ca pathetic attempt by a weak administration to curry favor with our Israeli allies who across the board reject this dangerous deal with Iran.\u201d\n\nThe New York Times speculates the intended audience may actually be Jewish Democrats like New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer, who have long pushed for Pollard\u2019s release and are on the fence about the Iran deal, though this doesn\u2019t seem like much of a prize given that there aren\u2019t enough no votes on the deal to overturn Obama\u2019s veto anyway.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:58:50.524+0000"}

He lives in Iowa City.\n\nA new Monmouth University poll in New Hampshire\u2014the first conducted in the state after Trump did his real-war-heroes-don\u2019t-get-captured shtick\u2014shows the real estate tycoon with a commanding 2-to-1 lead over his nearest rival, Jeb Bush. \u201cThe controversy over comments about John McCain\u2019s war service do not appear to have slowed the Trump steamroller,\u201d said Patrick Murray, the director of the university\u2019s polling institute.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTrump sits atop the Granite State poll with the support of 24 percent of likely Republican voters, followed by Bush in second place with 12 percent. John Kasich and Scott Walker are tied for third with 7 percent apiece, while Marco Rubio is in fifth with 6 percent of the vote. (In a world without Trump, Kasich\u2019s post-announcement surge would be generating its own headlines; unfortunately for the Ohio governor, he\u2019s getting trumped yet again.)\n\nTrump\u2019s lead was outside the poll\u2019s margin of error\u2014a relatively rare feat given the crowded field and the sample size\u2014but the usual caveats about making too much of a single poll taken this far out from an election do apply. Still, as opposed to an outlier, the new poll is largely more of the same for Trump. He was trending upwards in New Hampshire in the days before his McCain barb, and currently holds a lead of nearly three points over Bush in an average of the five most recent state polls tracked by RealClearPolitics.\n\nIt\u2019s also a similar story nationally, where Trump holds an average lead of 4.5 points over Bush, 6.5 points over Walker, and 11.4 points over Rubio. In a national CNN poll conducted in the days immediately after Trump\u2019s McCain comments, Trump led Bush by 3 points and Walker by 8. Those numbers don't tell us how The Donald will fare come 2016, but they do tell us that his particular package of outsider status and bloviated belligerence is currently appealing to a certain subset of GOP voters.\n\nTrump\u2019s long-term fundamental problems remain, though. Unlike many of his rivals who are viewed much more favorably by Republican voters, Trump generates mixed feelings. That reality was again on display in the Monmouth poll: 47 percent said they held a favorable view of him, while 44 percent said they had an unfavorable one. (For comparison, Walker posts a 57-16 split on the favorability question.) Still, 8 percent of respondents listed Trump as their second-choice for the GOP nomination, suggesting that the brash billionaire is not entirely the love-him-or-hate-him candidate he\u2019s often portrayed as.\n\nThe Monmouth poll also paints an interesting picture of what New Hampshire would look like in a world without Trump. If the celebrity businessman were not in the race, more than 4-in-10 of his supporters say they would be backing Chris Christie, Scott Walker, or Ted Cruz\u2014all three of whom would likely pick up 3 to 4 additional percentage points, according to the pollsters. But for now, the world we\u2019re all living in is one that Trump is very much a part of. Don\u2019t expect that to change until the GOP field narrows enough for the establishment favorites to consolidate support and push Trump down the polls\u2014and out of the race.\n\nElsewhere in Slate: The Case for Covering Trump: Why the media shouldn\u2019t ignore his doomed campaign.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:59:06.977+0000"}

Let\u2019s call this Huckabee\u2019s corollary.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee says that the response from Jews has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive\u201d to his claim last week that President Obama is marching Israelis \u201cto the door of the oven\u201d with the recently negotiated Iranian nuclear agreement. But that\u2019s a tough claim to make when, as Reuters reports, Israel\u2019s own ruling Likud party is criticizing the comment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIsraeli Ambassador to the United States Ron Dermer, a former GOP operative, close ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and fierce critic of the Iran deal, said the remark was inappropriate. Transport minister and Likud member Yisrael Katz wrote on Facebook, \"Dear Mr Huckabee, no one is marching Jews to the ovens anymore. \u2026 That is why we established the State of Israel and the Israel Defense Forces, and if necessary, we will know how to defend ourselves by ourselves.\"\n\nBut to be fair to Huckabee, it\u2019s not hard to see why he felt the comparison was within the bounds of acceptable discourse, given previous statements by Israeli leaders. After the Obama administration presented a \u201cframework agreement\u201d for a land swap deal with the Palestinians in 2014, deputy foreign minister Zeev Elkin rejected Israel\u2019s 1967 borders as \u201cAuschwitz borders.\u201d Netanyahu compared Iran to the Nazis in a speech at Israel\u2019s Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem in April, asking whether the world had learned nothing from the \u201cincomprehensible universal and Jewish tragedy\u201d of the last century.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s blunt reference to the machinery of mass murder was more crass, but it seems like his main mistake was making explicit what was implicit in all the many invocations of Nazism and World War II that have come up in this debate. It also feels a bit strange for an American, devoutly Christian governor to so explicitly invoke the history of Jewish suffering, but after decades of engagement with Israel on a much deeper and more enthusiastic level than nearly any American politician, Huckabee may feel he has mishpocha privileges.\n\nHuckabee has visited Israel dozens of times over 40 years, including as leader of a tour/pilgrimage known as the \u201cIsrael Experience With Mike Huckabee,\u201d on which the governor, his wife, and evangelical celebrities like the singer Pat Boone usher guests who pay more than $5,000 for the privilege around Israel. The trip\u2019s main focus may be biblical sites, but in the past has included meetings with Netanyahu and Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon. Huckabee told the New Yorker in 2012, \u201cI have a lot of Jewish friends, and they\u2019re kind of, like, \u2018You evangelicals love Israel more than we do.\u2019 I\u2019m, like, \u2018Do you not get it? If there weren\u2019t a Jewish faith, there wouldn\u2019t be a Christian faith!\u201d For Huckabee, this solidarity expresses itself in uncritical support for the most hawkish and least compromising strain of Israeli foreign policy, whether on negotiations with the Palestinians, settlement construction, or the Iran deal.\n\nAlong with pastor John Hagee, founder of Christians United for Israel, Huckabee is one of the most prominent proponents of Christian Zionism, an increasingly important pillar of Israel\u2019s support in the United States. White evangelical Americans are more likely than American Jews to believe God gave Israel to the Jewish people. Netanyahu has courted the support of evangelicals since the 1990s and has lauded Hagee\u2019s CUFI for helping to bring about a \u201ctransformation in the relationship between Christians and Jews.\u201d This relationship has only become more critical as Netanyahu has moved into a more openly partisan partnership with the GOP under the Obama administration.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:59:08.035+0000"}
{"entityId": 365, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Dave Kotinsky/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer Michael Cohen shared some very interesting opinions about marital rape this week. \u201cYou cannot rape your spouse,\u201d he told Daily Beast reporters. \u201cThere\u2019s very clear case law.\u201d\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nReporters Tim Mak and Brandy Zadrozny had contacted Cohen for a response to their story about the 1993 book Lost Tycoon: The Many Lives of Donald J. Trump by Harry Hurt III. Hurt recounts how Trump's ex-wife Ivana Trump, in a deposition during their divorce, described Trump raping her. Trump denied the allegations when the book came out, and Ivana, at the behest of Trump's lawyers, issued a statement saying that she didn't mean rape in \u201ca literal or criminal sense,\u201d but just that she \u201cfelt violated.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRape is a crime, however; it's not contained by how you feel but by objective questions such as Did she consent to the sex? By that measure, the scene in the book reads like rape. What's more, New York state banned marital rape in 1984, and this alleged incident happened in 1989. If it happened as described, it was rape in both the legal and \u201cemotional\u201d senses.\n\nIt's shocking that the incident described might have been legal if it happened just five years earlier. It seems obvious that it should be criminal to force your protesting spouse into sex while pulling out chunks of her hair. Yet marital rape was only banned in all 50 states in 1993, when North Carolina and Oklahoma finally got around to it. As of 2014, eight states still had laws treating marital rape differently than other rape.\n\nAlong with the recent rush of women accusing Bill Cosby of rape or sexual assault, the Trump story shows how rapidly public opinion is shifting on the subject of rape. We are reaching a cultural consensus that the dividing line between rape and not-rape is consent. It's hard for these women to speak out, but it's also increasingly impossible to argue that nonconsensual sex is somehow a \u201cgray area\u201d or just \u201cbad sex\u201d instead of rape.\n\nEven while people shied away from the R-word in the past, they still had an intrinsic understanding that it's wrong to force women to have sex. Cosby's accusers describe the great pains he took to conceal his behavior. Ivana Trump described crying all night long; Lost Tycoon claims Trump gloated about how he hurt her\u2014causing pain was the point. In reality, men who rape usually aren't confused about the question of consent. They do, however, enjoy it when others confuse the issue for them.\n\nWhat is shifting is that the rest of us are less and less willing to play that game for them. We still have a long way to go, however, as seen in this New York Times story by Sandy Keenan about affirmative consent standards on campus. \u201cMen tend to rely on nonverbal cues in interpreting consent (61 percent say they get consent via body language), but women tend to wait to be asked before signaling consent (only 10 percent say they give consent via body language),\u201d Keenan writes. \u201cNo wonder there\u2019s so much confusion.\u201d\n\nHuman communication is complicated, but that doesn't necessarily make it confusing. Other research has shown that men are just as capable as women of understanding subtle cues of nonconsent. We're all capable of telling if someone looks bored or reluctant or of interpreting \u201csoft\u201d noes such as \u201cGosh, I have to get up early.\u201d Most of us practice affirmative consent implicitly: looking for signs of interest before proceeding, pulling back if someone stiffens up or starts issuing \u201csoft\u201d noes such as \u201cI really can't right now.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cno means no\u201d movement was about shutting down rapists who tried to confuse the issue over whether it really counts if she came to your room/she's your wife/she wore a short skirt/she accepted the drink you drugged. \u201cYes means yes\u201d is about shutting down rapists who claim, falsely, to not know it's wrong to rape someone even if she is too drunk to stand/she said \u201cI want to go home\u201d/she just laid there crying instead of asking me to stop. It's about shutting down bad-faith excuses by shifting the discussion to how the aggressor knew he had a yes.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:59:10.904+0000"}

This year SarahPAC has depleted much of its once prodigious cash reserve, spending about a quarter-million dollars more than it raised, according to new filings with the Federal Election Commission.\n\nSarahPAC\u2019s financial malaise coincides with Palin\u2019s own star power dimming: Fox News in June declined to renew Palin\u2019s contract as a commentator, and the Sarah Palin Channel, a subscription-based online TV feed Palin launched in 2014, is going dark this week.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhile SarahPAC\u2019s $562,000 cash-on-hand figure is better than what most political committees could boast, it\u2019s the PAC\u2019s lowest total since mid-2009, the year Palin founded the operation. Since late 2009, SarahPAC has almost always carried more than $1 million on its books and never less than $800,000.\n\nSarahPAC\u2019s financial malaise coincides with Palin\u2019s own star power dimming.\n\nSo where\u2019d the money go?\n\nUnlike many political action committees, very little of the $753,000 it spent from Jan. 1 to June 30, 2015, went directly to political candidates and committees. Instead, SarahPAC\u2019s top expenditures largely helped fortify its own existence\u2014or helped Palin personally.\n\nFederal rules governing spending by \u201cleadership PACs\u201d\u2014committees run by current or former elected officials\u2014are notoriously permissive, with both Democrats and Republicans regularly using the cash to fund lavish travel, pricy gifts, or just about any other self-indulgent expense.\n\nSome of the top recent SarahPAC expenditures have included:\n\n$230,250 on consultants, including $80,500 to longtime aide and PAC treasurer Timothy Crawford\n\n$139,932 on direct mail, produced by conservative fundraising firm HSP Direct\n\n$128,482 on postage, printing, and related supplies\n\n$82,213 on travel and accommodations, including airfare, hotels, car and SUV rentals, travel agents, and taxis. The Waldorf Astoria in New York City ($4,562) and Venetian Resort Hotel Casino in Las Vegas ($797) were two particularly pricy line items. The $3,854 SarahPAC paid a New York\u2013based limousine company came on Feb. 19, right after Palin appeared at the staging of Saturday Night Live\u2019s 40th anniversary special, where she sat in the audience next to musician Taylor Swift.\n\n$48,000 on speech writing, mostly to Aries Petra Consulting, a small limited liability company registered in Virginia and based in Los Angeles\n\n$37,354 on Internet fundraising through Austin, Texas\u2013based Harris Media LLC, which works for numerous conservative politicians\n\nYet, during the first half of 2015, SarahPAC only spent $25,000 on candidate contributions\u2014less than 4 percent of its overall expenditures.\n\nConservative Republican Reps.

During his final interview with Stewart earlier this month, the president joked that he would be issuing an executive order preventing Stewart from leaving the job. The pair has been described as a couple in a romantic comedy and in more searing terms by right-wing critics like Sean Hannity.\n\nOn Tuesday, Politico disclosed new details about just how important Obama viewed his relationship with Stewart, reporting that the president summoned the Comedy Central performer to the White House on multiple occasions to make the case for his policies, including one occasion where he laid out his re-election pitch.\n\nJon Stewart slipped unnoticed into the White House in the midst of the October 2011 budget fight, summoned to an Oval Office coffee with President Barack Obama that he jokingly told his escort felt like being called into the principal\u2019s office.\n\nIn February 2014, Obama again requested Stewart make the trip from Manhattan to the White House, this time for a mid-morning visit hours before the president would go before television cameras to warn Russia that \u201cthere will be costs\u201d if it made any further military intervention in Ukraine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the 2011 meeting, just less than a year before he would face re-election, Obama used the occasion to set the groundwork for his 2012 campaign and respond to liberal critics, according to former top economic aide Austan Goolsbee.\n\n\u201cThe White House itself was quite interested in at least explaining its side of the story to Jon Stewart,\u201d Goolsbee told Politico, \u201cup to and including the president.\u201d\n\nPolitico also describes how Stewart\u2019s show could sometimes influence White House thinking, including on policy issues.\n\nIn March 2009, Stewart discussed the new Obama administration\u2019s idea of removing veterans with private insurance plans from the VA rolls. \u201cThat can\u2019t be right,\u201d he intoned. The Obama White House scrapped the plan one day after his segment aired, and veterans\u2019 advocates recall Stewart\u2019s commentary being discussed during a West Wing meeting with senior aides including then-Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t say that because Jon Stewart was unhappy policy changed. But I can say that he had forceful arguments, they were arguments that we knew would be heard and deserved to be answered,\u201d former senior Obama adviser David Axelrod said.\n\nAxelrod, who was on the show the night that Stewart announced his retirement and has been a regular guest, told Politico that he kept in touch with Stewart by phone and email during his time in the White House.\n\nWhile Stewart occasionally goes after Democrats, the GOP has clearly been his most frequent target over the years. Sen. Claire McCaskill said that her party is taking his imminent departure seriously. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you some Democrats are worried,\u201d she told Politico.\n\nObama was the first sitting president to appear on The Daily Show, making his fifth appearance on the show just days before the 2010 midterm election. \u201cThe president hasn\u2019t been shy about going to the places where people are getting their information and trying to make his case,\u201d then-White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said at the time.\n\n\"Few people in media had the ability to influence the political debate like Jon Stewart,\" longtime Obama advisor Dan Pfeiffer told Politico earlier this year when Stewart announced his retirement. He added that Stewart \u201cconducted some of the toughest and most insightful interviews of the president.\u201d\n\nFormer White House press secretary Jay Carney called Obama\u2019s 2012 pre-election interview with Stewart the \u201ctoughest\u201d he faced during that campaign. \u201c[It was] probably the most substantive, challenging interview Barack Obama had in the election year,\u201d he told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Major Garrett last year.\n\nIf the White House actually viewed him as a \u201cchallenging\u201d questioner, they also apparently viewed him as someone who would be receptive to specific pitches from the president. From Politico:\n\nIn Stewart\u2019s first show after his February 2014 visit to the White House, he picked up on the Russia-Ukraine news that Obama had spoken about in the press briefing room a few hours after their private chat.\n\nCalling out excessive military bellicosity is one of Stewart\u2019s strong suits, so the Obama meeting certainly didn't necessairly have to have had an influence for him to do a segment like that. It is notable, though, that Stewart went specifically after critics of the White House\u2019s response to the Russian invasion as being overly hawkish, including Sen.

At the time of the book's publication Ivana admitted in a statement to having used the term \"rape\" during a deposition to describe the incident in question but said that, though she \"felt violated\" by what happened, she did not believe rape had occurred in a \"literal or criminal sense.\" Responding to the Beast's inquiries in the present day, a Trump lawyer named Michael Cohen claimed erroneously that legally there's no such thing as raping your spouse (non-consensual marital sex is illegal in every state) and threatened to sue the Beast for $500 million, telling a reporter for the site that \"what I\u2019m going to do to you is going to be fucking disgusting.\"\n\n\n\nWell, that was yesterday!

{"entityId": 369, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Librarians have been enhancing our abilities to seek and judge knowledge for centuries, and their skills are more essential, not less, in the digital age. In just the past decade American librarians have fought for our right to access controversial materials. They have put their freedom on the line for our privacy and civil liberties. They have pushed for more reasonable copyright laws. At a moment when the ubiquity of \u201cinformation\u201d often renders us incapable of sifting the true from the false, they have helped us sort the relevant from the trivial and the authoritative from the salacious. That makes libraries and librarians more essential than ever. And they have done all this without coordination and leadership from the most important library in the world.\n\nThe reality is that, despite its important role in American history, the library has never significantly touched the lives and minds of Americans across the country, as Jefferson hoped it would. But starting in 2016, it has that opportunity. The next leader of the library should start by fixing the problems that have been well documented in recent reports about mismanagement. And she must confront the embarrassing lack of resources devoted to digital preservation and exhibition. But merely solving technological and management problems would deny the United States a chance to extend the power of the library\u2019s curated knowledge, enriching our own citizens and indeed the rest of the world.\n\nThe vast majority of copyrighted work never gets printed these days, let alone submitted to the Copyright Office, and fewer authors bother with registration. Thus the job of serving as the \u201clibrary of record\u201d becomes more challenging every year. The library has made cosmetic efforts to make itself relevant in an increasingly digital age\u2014it now handles the entire archive of Twitter posts, for example\u2014but it has no idea how to make such archives useful to researchers. Library leadership has been stuck in the same vinyl record groove for far too long. In March the Government Accountability Office issued a scathing report about Billington\u2019s failures to manage the library in recent years, noting that the library has failed to upgrade basic services and technologies, failed to leverage its digital collections, and ceased being a leader among innovative libraries in the world.\n\nThomas Jefferson reseeded the Library of Congress with his own impressive book collection after British troops burned the library and its 3,000 books in 1814. Over the ensuing 200 years, the library became a national treasure to researchers and tourists, a repository of our rich tradition of American publishing, and an essential resource for congressional staff. For more than a century, the library was fully stocked as the official copyright repository: You can\u2019t register a copyright without submitting a work to the library. But as the collections have grown\u2014they now include music, film, television, and radio recordings, as well as video games, software, and electronic records of Web publications\u2014the library has increasingly depended on congressional appropriations to keep its operations going. And funding has been far below what the library needs to perform its functions of preserving all this material and making it available to the pubic.\n\nThere is some push now to encourage Obama to appoint a professional librarian with administrative experience from one of America\u2019s outstanding academic research libraries. But the library needs more than a respected scholar or librarian. It needs a visionary who can leverage the position to lead us through some essential upgrades and debates that could push this vital institution into public consciousness.\n\nTraditionally, the Librarian of Congress has been an esteemed scholar who does not threaten conservative sensibilities. Billington is a revered historian of Russia. For much of his tenure, especially early on, he was regarded as a stable and effective advocate for the institution. But he never seemed to grasp the potential of digital media to expand the influence\u2014and thus the value\u2014of the library.\n\nLast month, Librarian of Congress James Billington announced that he will resign as of Jan. 1, 2016, after 28 years in office. Filling this vacancy may not seem like the most pressing matter before President Barack Obama, but in fact the decision is one that could help define his legacy. He has the opportunity to name a visionary leader who can nudge the nation toward a richer, more open information ecosystem appropriate for a democratic republic in the 21 st century.\n\nImagine if, starting in 2016, the librarian of Congress were to launch two projects: One would push for solutions to important information policy issues. The librarian should use the power of the office to lead on questions of privacy, copyright, and access to knowledge. She should also be a voice of reason and erudition on these massively important issues that are evolving ever more quickly, and a non-partisan one\u2014a representative of the people\u2019s interests, not corporate ones. As a start to this process, the Library could convene a series of meetings of the major global leaders of digital companies, publishers, librarians, civil liberties groups, and security experts. Through these meetings, delegates could outline the challenges facing our global information ecosystem: Privacy and surveillance; copyright and free speech; and the potential for coordinating digital library resources across the globe.\n\nSo the first step would be to encourage, and focus, essential debates our democracy needs to be having about the future of information. The second major project would actually build something great. Beyond merely firing up long-delayed digitization projects like the Twitter archive (and lobbying for the necessary funds to do so), the librarian of Congress could lead the national effort to coordinate digital collections among state and local libraries. University and state libraries have engaged in uncoordinated, underfunded efforts to push their collections out to users in every corner of their communities. The Wisconsin Historical Society, for example, has undertaken an ambitious project on the 1964 Freedom Summer and another on Wisconsin residents who survived the Holocaust. But without strong leadership from the national library, these efforts have been too easy to ignore. For the last few years an independent organization called the Digital Public Library of America has worked valiantly toward this goal. (Disclosure: I serve on the board of the Digital Public Library of America, but I do not speak for it; the opinions expressed here are my own). The DPLA has made great progress, but it would benefit greatly from greater leadership and support from the Library of Congress.\n\nThe librarian of Congress could also lead a global effort to coordinate digital standards, search protocols, and metadata standards among national libraries around the world. If such a global project were to come to fruition, it could go a long way toward erasing knowledge disparities between countries. A child growing up in Namibia might some day have the same information resources as one growing up in Canada. Such a global project, a Human Knowledge Project, could take decades to build. It would not be cheap or easy. But if we truly believe that more and better knowledge fosters better citizenship, better governance, and better fortunes, we can\u2019t skimp. We also can\u2019t wait.\n\nPresident Obama came into office on the winds of the information revolution. His 2008 campaign harnessed social media like no campaign before or since. He was the first president personally savvy with digital media, as his Blackberry addiction attests. But after almost seven years in office, Obama has yet to leave his mark on our information ecosystem. The copyright system remains opaque and cumbersome, satisfying neither content producers nor users. Instead of fostering an informed debate over surveillance and privacy, the Obama administration defended secretive programs his predecessor installed and prosecuted many of the whistle blowers who have finally sparked a debate we should have had in 2002. His initiative to spread high-speed broadband to rural communities has stalled as Congress has declined to fund it adequately. Only Obama\u2019s strong support of network neutrality has been embedded in policy, although it took six years and two FCC chairmen to get it done. So there is much work to be done. And the Library of Congress is the ideal place to start.\n\nThe next librarian of Congress could guide us through these and other thorny issues, coordinating and collaborating across government, industry, and civil society. But she would have to be an exceptional political leader with unusual powers of persuasion and unlimited patience. The next librarian of Congress should begin her term with a single guiding question: What sort of information ecosystem does this republic need in the 21st century? All policies and projects should flow from that.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:59:18.651+0000"}

And if you're in the process of committing a crime, you probably shouldn't let your smartphone call 911. Now a Cincinnati federal appeals court has ruled that if you accidentally butt dial someone you don't have a reasonable expectation of privacy.\n\nLily Hay Newman Lily Hay Newman is a staff writer and the lead blogger for Future Tense.\n\n\n\nLast week, Judge Danny Boggs compared a butt dial (which he calls a pocket-dial) to leaving a window uncovered such that a neighbor or anyone else can peer in. He was deciding an appeal in a case in which an executive on the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport board, James Huff, called the CEO's assistant, Carol Spaw, finished the call, put his phone in his pocket, and then unintentionally called her back. During that second call, Huff started talking to another executive about replacing the airport's CEO.* Spaw said hello a few times and tried to get their attention, but they were talking about her boss, so when that didn't work she started recording the 91-minute call and taking detailed notes. Gotta do it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBy the end of call, Huff had met up with his wife, Bertha Huff, and he summarized what he had discussed with the other executive for her\u2014just in case Spaw didn't quite catch it the first time. After the incident, Spaw distributed the recording and her notes to other members of the airport board. The Huffs are the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of strange things about this butt dial, which occurred in October 2013. As Bloomberg points out, it's unusual not to check your phone for more than an hour, and as Gawker notes, it seems like even when Huff did finally identify the butt dial he didn't actually terminate the call for two minutes. Of course, the difference between leaving your curtains open and calling someone by accident is intent. You open your curtains by choice, or should be able to clearly see that they're open, as opposed to being oblivious to a butt dial. But Boggs wrote, \"James Huff lacked a reasonable expectation of privacy in his statements only to the extent that a third-party gained access to those statements through a pocket-dial call that he placed.\" (Emphasis preserved.)\n\nBoggs notes that there are ways to prevent butt dials, like adding a numeric code or other lock screen. He wrote:\n\n\n\nIn sum, a person who knowingly operates a device that is capable of inadvertently exposing his conversations to third-party listeners and fails to take simple precautions to prevent such exposure does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to statements that are exposed to an outsider by the inadvertent operation of that device.\n\nThe discussion goes on to say that Bertha Huff did have a reasonable expectation of privacy, because she was speaking with her husband in their hotel room and should be able to expect that he hasn't butt-dialed someone, just like she should be able to expect that he wasn't intentionally recording their conversation. Boggs wrote:\n\n\n\nIf Bertha waived her reasonable expectation of privacy from pocket-dials by speaking to a person who she knew to carry a pocket-dial-capable device, she would also waive her reasonable expectation of privacy from recordings and transmissions by speaking with anyone carrying a recording-capable or transmission-capable device, i.e., any modern cellphone.\n\nThe case will go back to district court to determine whether Spaw is liable for recording Bertha Huff. If you're not already locking your phone for security reasons (you should be), maybe it's time to do it. Your butt can get you in a lot of trouble if you're not careful.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T02:59:25.168+0000"}

It\u2019s been a fascinating challenge. The issues I face with my colleagues are among the toughest in the world. At times, making progress on them is frustratingly slow. Thankfully, it\u2019s hard to be deterred when you\u2019re surrounded by the energy, vibrancy, and diversity of New York City. It really is a place where you feel anything and everything is possible.\n\nI saw this so clearly during the New York Pride march last month. It was a privilege to be part of such a historic celebration, just 48 hours after the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality. It was an inspiring day; a day that so many had fought so hard, and for so long, to achieve. I was incredibly proud to march with colleagues and friends on the United Kingdom float. It was a fitting celebration of the activists, leaders, donors, friends, and allies who made LGBT rights a reality in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs we celebrated a historic step forward in the United States, I was struck by how much more needs to be done in other parts of the world to advance LGBT rights. I firmly believe that the United Nations can play a key role in advancing this agenda. No other forum brings together so many countries\u2014193 in total. And at the heart of the U.N. Charter is a shared faith in fundamental human rights and in the dignity and worth of all people.\n\nYet the breadth of the U.N. membership is also precisely the reason why progress is sometimes so slow. Too many member states continue to punish their citizens for who they are and for whom they love. Too many member states believe that social exclusion, harassment, violence, and even death are acceptable responses to the LGBT community in their countries.\n\nPhoto by Eleanor Dodd\n\nThe United Kingdom and, I believe, the vast majority of U.N. members fundamentally disagree with this approach and are taking steps to challenge this mindset. The United Kingdom is proud to be playing a leading role in this effort. We are a member of the LGBT Core Group, a cross-regional group of countries advocating and negotiating at the United Nations for recognition and protection of the human rights of LGBT people. We partner with civil society and the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights. We use high-level U.N. events and social media campaigns to keep this issue on the international agenda. In time, we hope to change the hearts and minds of all countries.\n\nWe have many allies in the U.N. system, including Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Earlier this year, he took the bold decision to broaden benefits for U.N. employees in same-sex relationships, despite opposition from some U.N. members. Elsewhere, UNHCHR\u2019s \u201cFree & Equal\u201d campaign is working with civil society around the world to amplify the words of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights that \u201call people are born free and equal in dignity and rights.\u201d\n\nTogether we can make these words a reality for every person, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity. This year will be vital to achieving this goal. In September the United Nations will come together to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals. These goals will set the global development agenda for the next 15 years. Through the SDGs, we have the chance to eradicate extreme poverty and help the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world.\n\nThe United Kingdom is adamant that when developing the SDGs, we need to keep human rights up front. People must be at the heart of the goals. That is why we support the principle of \u201cleave no one behind\u201d at the core of the SDGs. No goal or target of the new agenda can be considered met unless it is met for all groups in society. This includes the LGBT community. Inclusion is the right thing to do, but it is also the smart thing to do to achieve true sustainable development.\n\nSo as we look ahead to September, my message to everyone who has worked so hard to promote LGBT rights, whether in New York or across the world, is this: Don\u2019t lose your momentum or enthusiasm. LGBT people around the world aren\u2019t just fighting for the right of equal marriage; they are fighting for the right to life and liberty. There is still much work to be done. All governments represented at the United Nations need to hear your voices and your demands for inclusion, tolerance, and understanding. I'm proud to say that the United Kingdom is committed to doing exactly that.\n\nThis video from the U.N.

In many interviews, Kerry portrays the P5+1 as a weak-willed coalition that was about to splinter if the deal hadn\u2019t been signed. He told the CFR audience:\n\n2. Iran is right that we shoehorned the conventional arms embargo into the nuclear deal. Kerry told the CFR audience that our then\u2013United Nations ambassador, Susan Rice, \u201cslipped the arms embargo thing in at the very last minute\u201d when the United Nations was adopting a resolution against Iran\u2019s nuclear program. In the Senate hearing, Kerry explained that as a result, Iran \u201cfelt it was being rammed at them in the context of a nuclear agreement, and it had no business being part of a nuclear agreement.\u201d Kerry says the United States and its allies scored a big win by continuing the embargo over Iran\u2019s objections. But he also seems to admit it was a dirty win.\n\n1. Iran had already decided not to pursue a bomb. Whether or not this is true, Kerry seems to believe it. On the one hand, he told the Voice of America that the deal had to be cut and the necessary compromises had to be made now, in order to stop Iran from getting a bomb. If the P5+1 (the six countries negotiating with Iran\u2014the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany) had broadened the talks to include other issues, he argued, \u201cWe would have been negotiating for 10 years ... and we didn\u2019t have that kind of time because of the nuclear issue and where the progress was.\u201d But in other remarks, Kerry has undercut that claim. He told the BBC that \u201cthe Ayatollah has decided they\u2019re not going to have [a bomb] anyway.\u201d Kerry also told the Senate :\n\nIn the two weeks since Kerry concluded the nuclear arms deal with Iran, he has given at least 18 interviews about the deal, plus a long press conference , four hours of Senate testimony , and an hourlong discussion at the Council on Foreign Relations . He has strong talking points, and he makes a persuasive case for the deal. But Kerry has never been capable of staying on message. The more he talks, the more he reveals, and much of what he reveals isn\u2019t helpful. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned about what happened backstage\u2014and what Kerry personally believes\u2014from his 20-something public appearances.\n\nJohn Kerry, the U.S. secretary of state, is a thoughtful, honest man. He\u2019s remarkably adept at seeing conflicts and issues from the perspectives of other people. That makes him a good person and, in many ways, a good diplomat. But it made him a clumsy presidential candidate, prone to expressing arguments on both sides of every issue . It also makes him an awkward spokesman for his country.\n\n5. Here are our nuclear detection methods. Kerry has hastened to assure senators that we can detect forbidden nuclear activity at inspection sites, even if Iran stalls for the 24 days allowed under the agreement. But the assurances often veer into too much detail. In his CFR appearance, Kerry discussed the \u201cenvironmental swabs\u201d that caught Iran\u2019s nuclear activity in 2003. And on Friday, he told Lauer: \u201cThe Department of Energy has done tests. They\u2019ve had people sandblast, paint over, concrete, do everything to any kind of nuclear material. You can\u2019t get rid of it.\u201d I\u2019m glad to hear that. But do we really need to spell out, for potential cheaters, the precise extent of our tests?\n\n6. We didn\u2019t need the breakout time we demanded. A major boast in Kerry\u2019s media tour is that the deal extended Iran\u2019s breakout time\u2014the time Iran would need to produce a nuclear weapon, or at least enough fuel for a weapon\u2014from two months to a year. But during his CFR appearance, Kerry blurted out: \u201cFrankly, two months is more than we need.\u201d If that\u2019s true\u2014and if Iran wasn\u2019t serious about getting closer\u2014why the haste to cut the deal?\n\n7. We raised the issue of American captives. In a July 15 press conference, President Obama was asked about Americans who are being held captive in Iran. He said it would have been dangerous to entangle these people in the nuclear talks: \u201cIf the question is why we did not tie the negotiations to their release, think about the logic that that creates. Suddenly Iran realizes, you know what, maybe we can get additional concessions out of the Americans by holding these individuals.\u201d But two days later, Kerry declared on MSNBC that \u201cthere was not a meeting that took place\u2014not one meeting that took place\u2014believe me, that\u2019s not an exaggeration\u2014where we did not raise the issue of our American citizens being held.\u201d\n\n8. Russia wasn\u2019t nearly as difficult as we\u2019ve pretended. One of Kerry\u2019s talking points is that we had to make compromises because Russia and China were tugging the other way. But when Sen. John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming, alleged in last week\u2019s hearing that \u201cRussia and Iran teamed up\u201d in the talks, Kerry shot him down. \u201cActually, the Iranians were furious at the Russians on any number of accounts,\u201d said Kerry. \u201cThe Russians, they felt, were not cooperative with them and didn\u2019t help them.\u201d If that\u2019s true, why all the compromises?\n\n9. We timed this to protect the deal from a Republican president. Several Republicans have threatened to scrap the deal if they capture the White House next year. Kerry is betting that they won\u2019t. In his July 14 news conference, he explained:\n\nI really believe deeply that if Iran fully implements, with two years already under Iran\u2019s belt, during which time Iran\u2019s program has effectively been frozen\u2014and they have begun to show people that they\u2019re not able or ready to make a bomb ... I am convinced that whoever is our next president will see the wisdom of this agreement, and they will leave it in place.\n\nIn other words, Kerry and Obama have calculated that by cutting the deal now, they\u2019re giving Iran enough time to lock in a status quo the GOP will be afraid to overturn.\n\n10. We don\u2019t care whether Congress votes against the deal. On Face the Nation, Slate\u2019s John Dickerson asked Kerry, \u201cIf you don\u2019t get a majority in Congress to support this deal, doesn\u2019t that undermine the deal?\u201d Kerry answered: \u201cNo, not in the least. The Congress\u2014they don\u2019t care over there whether it\u2019s majority or a minority, or whatever it is, as long as the deal is implemented.

Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.\n\nAnswer by Stephen Tempest, qualified amateur historian:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDuring the Hundred Years' War, England had a centralized, state-controlled organization for manufacturing arrows in bulk. These were then issued as required to the soldiers on campaign.\n\nIn June 1413, for example, Henry V appointed Nicholas Mynot to be \u201ckeeper of the king's arrows,\u201d based in the Tower of London. Mynot was responsible for making arrows, but the royal fletchers alone could not supply the total need, so additional orders were placed with outside suppliers. In August 1413, for example, London-based fletcher Stephen Seler was paid for 12,000 arrows.\n\nWe have some total figures available. In 1418, Henry V's government purchased 150,000 arrows; in 1421, it acquired nearly 500,000. Several years' supply would be stockpiled for a major campaign. Half a century earlier in 1360, Edward III's accounts reveal that 566,400 arrows (and 11,000 bows) were stored in the Tower of London alone.\n\nArrows were fletched with goose feathers, which were collected from the peasantry as a form of tax. In 1418-9 Henry V ordered his sheriffs (the royal officials in each county) to collect a total of 1.19 million goose feathers over the course of 10 months, to be delivered to the Tower of London by Michaelmas (on Sept. 29). A similar though smaller order, two years earlier, specified that six feathers should be taken from each goose.\n\nOn campaign, arrows were bulk-packed in barrels and transported in wagons. Longbowmen might be issued with three sheaves of 24 arrows each to carry into combat, and during a long battle runners would be sent to bring more arrows from the wagons.\n\nIt's possible some archers brought their own arrows. People who were foresters or hunters (or bandits) in civilian life would be accustomed to supplying their own needs and might prefer arrows whose length and weight was better suited to the draw weight of their bow than the standard government-issue arrows. However, on a long campaign overseas it's unlikely they'd want to lug around huge numbers of arrows themselves.\n\nIt's possible arrows were salvaged after a battle. In 1343, the accounts of the Tower of London record that Robert Mildenhall \u201cbrought back\u201d 7,000 arrows from a campaign in Brittany that had to be cleaned and re-bound into sheaves, taking 10 workers six days.\n\nThis centralized system was an innovation of the 14th century. Before then, soldiers were simply ordered to arrive at the feudal muster bringing their own weapons and equipment, at their own expense (or that of their lord).", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:00:32.680+0000"}

To his enemies, this short man, softened by age and bundled in long sleeves against the facility\u2019s overzealous air conditioning, is a kind of Jewish Kurt Waldheim: a brutal war criminal who deftly covered his tracks and went on to run one of the world\u2019s leading human rights institutions. Waldheim, a former Nazi officer, famously became secretary-general of the United Nations before the truth came out. Arad allegedly committed atrocities against Lithuanian anti-Communists on behalf of Stalin\u2019s secret police, the NKVD, before moving to Israel and becoming the director of Yad Vashem, the nation\u2019s holocaust museum.\n\nSitting near a table of wheelchair-bound women Arad, who is 88, recounted blowing up trains in Nazi-occupied Europe. With his blunt fingers and lupine eyes, I could still sense the fearsome fighter he\u2019d been as a teenaged partisan in the frozen Baltic forests and later as an IDF desert tank commander. As a teenager, Arad lost his parents and most of his family in the Holocaust. He insisted to me that he has nothing to apologize for. \u201cI am proud that I fought the Nazi Germans and their Lithuanian collaborators,\u201d he said. \u201cThat fate made it possible for me to fight against the murderers of my family, the murderers of my people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am proud that I fought the Nazi Germans and their Lithuanian collaborators\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAt my request, Arad went upstairs to the room he shares with his wife and fetched a war medal he received for his service fighting the Nazis behind enemy lines. It had been issued by the Soviet Union, which backed the partisans in their struggle against the Germans. \u201cThis is the Partisan Medal, First Degree,\u201d Arad explained. \u201cThe most important medal for partisans.\u201d Cast seven decades ago, the tarnished medal had outlived the state that issued it, but the profile of Stalin proudly staring off into the distance, upstaging a profile of Lenin behind it, remained clear.\n\nYitzhak Arad\u2019s Partisan Medal, First Degree, received for his service fighting the Nazis, issued by the Soviet Union. Photos courtesy of Daniel Brook.\n\nAlthough Arad claims no sympathy for communism, he held onto the medal when he abandoned Stalin\u2019s Lithuania at the end of the war and made his way to Palestine. \u201cI hid it in bread,\u201d he told me, explaining how he\u2019d hollowed out a loaf and stuck the medal inside. \u201cIf I\u2019d been caught by the Soviets, they would have\u2014if not killed me\u2014sent me to Siberia for fleeing. I deserted.\u201d Keeping the medal was a risk, he said, but it was important to him because it was the only recognition of his service during the war. \u201cLook, I was fighting a few years, I wanted it, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe it was a stupid thing.\u201d\n\nArad also kept the award\u2019s accompanying certificate acknowledging his service to the Soviets under his birth name, Itzik Rudnicki. When he showed it to me, I saw that it was hand-signed by Justus Paleckis, the brutal puppet president who ran Lithuania for Stalin.\n\nYitzhak Arad\u2019s certificate acknowledging his service to the Soviets. Photo courtesy of Daniel Brook.\n\nThese days, Arad, and others like him, are no longer lauded for their wartime efforts on behalf of Lithuania. In a new party line, institutions of the contemporary Lithuanian government now portray Nazi-aligned nationalists as anti-Soviet heroes and anti-Nazi partisans\u2014in particular the Jewish ones\u2014as traitors. Arad lives under the cloud of an open-ended investigation by Lithuanian prosecutors for crimes against humanity committed in the final days of World War II, when he allegedly executed Lithuanian anti-Communists, including civilians, for Stalin\u2019s secret police. After decades of being hailed as a war hero, the old man sitting across the table from me had, in the eyes of his homeland, become a war criminal.\n\n2 A Complete Destruction\n\nThe Lithuania where Yitzhak Arad was born, in 1926, was much like the Israel where he lives today: a center of gravity for the global Jewish community. Given the perpetually shifting borders of the Eastern European lowlands over the centuries, the Lithuanian capital, now called Vilnius, found itself at times part of Russia and Poland as well as Lithuania, but to its Jews, the city was always \u201cVilna\u201d and they were always \u201cLitvaks\u201d\u2014a Yiddish word that literally means \u201cLithuanians.\u201d\n\nThough fewer than 5,000 Jews live in the country today, from the 14th through mid-20th centuries, Lithuania was a hub of Jewish life. The initial influx arrived in the Middle Ages when the bubonic plague swept through Western Europe killing thousands of Jews\u2014many from the plague itself, but many others at the hands of Christian neighbors who blamed them for the disease. Jews fled to the east and thrived in the culture of tolerance they found there. By 1750 the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which included parts of modern-day Poland, Latvia, and Belarus, had become the world\u2019s largest Jewish community. By the early 20th century, Vilna, \u201cthe Jerusalem of the North,\u201d boasted more than 100 synagogues and a thriving secular Jewish life, replete with Yiddish newspapers and theaters and civic groups. Economically, Jews dominated trade and the learned professions, provoking the ire of Catholic Lithuanian ultra-nationalists who urged Lithuanian society to break free from the supposed stranglehold of its Jewish minority. Before World War II, about 60,000 Jews lived in Vilnius, constituting roughly one-third of the city\u2019s population.\n\nIn 1939, Hitler and Stalin secretly divided Eastern Europe between them. Lithuania, pressed up against the Russian border, was allotted to Stalin and was absorbed into the USSR in 1940 after a sham election in which the Stalin-backed party was the only one on the ballot. Jews suffered under Soviet occupation. Since they ran a disproportionate number of businesses, newspapers, and civic organizations\u2014the civil society institutions with no future in a Soviet utopia\u2014they were natural targets for the Stalinists and thousands were deported to Siberia. At the same time, since there were also many Lithuanian-Jewish communists, Jews were blamed by their countrymen for the Soviet takeover. That Russian Jews had been wildly overrepresented in the generation that led the Bolshevik Revolution is indisputable. But by the time World War II broke out, Stalin had long since purged most Jewish Communists from the Soviet elite in Moscow. After the war, Jews would have only a minor role in running Soviet Lithuania, in part because of Soviet anti-Semitism but, more crucially, because nearly all of them would be dead.\n\nIn hindsight, the Lithuanian Jews who got sent to the gulags were the lucky ones\u2014they were much more likely to survive World War II than those they left behind. In June 1941, Hitler launched a surprise attack on the Soviet Union, overrunning the Baltics in a few weeks. As documented by eyewitness testimony, photographs, and Nazi records, the Christian majority welcomed the Germans as liberators and right-wing paramilitary groups began massacring their Jewish neighbors before German rule had even been firmly established. Over the next three years of German occupation, around 200,000 Jews, more than 95 percent of Lithuania\u2019s Jewish population, were murdered\u2014a more complete destruction than befell any other European country. In an of inversion of Denmark, the nation where massive local resistance to the Nazi occupiers saved the lives of most Danish Jews, in Lithuania, zealous local collaboration ensured near-complete extermination. One of the only ways for a Jew to survive the Holocaust in Lithuania\u2014the deadliest place on a deadly continent\u2014was the way Yitzhak Arad did: as a partisan fighting the Nazis and their collaborators in the forests.\n\n3 Independence, and an Opportunity\n\nAfter the war, Lithuania was reincorporated into the USSR and Soviet authorities suppressed the truth about the significant Jewish role in the partisan resistance and the remarkable degree of local Christian collaboration with the Nazis. The myth that Soviet citizens of all ethnicities had united to valiantly resist the Germans became the official party line. In Soviet Holocaust memorials, the victims were typically referred to as \u201cSoviet citizens\u201d and the murderers as \u201cfascists,\u201d obscuring the facts that Soviet Jews had been singled out for extermination because of their ethnicity and that many of the murderers were also Soviet citizens, albeit disloyal ones. The closest the Soviet authorities would ever come to acknowledging the important role Jews played as partisans was the placement of the official partisans memorial, erected in 1983, in a park on Vilnius\u2019 Pylimo Street, the main thoroughfare of the city\u2019s pre-War Jewish neighborhood.\n\nDuring the Nazi occupation, 95 percent of Lithuania\u2019s Jewish population was murdered\n\nWhen Lithuania broke free of Soviet rule in 1991, the roughly 12,000 Jewish Lithuanians then remaining in the country were anxious to set the record straight. \u201cWe hoped that when Lithuania gained its independence, it would be possible for the Jews to find their place in the consciousness of the society,\u201d said Rachel Kostanian, who helped re-establish Vilnius\u2019 Jewish museum, which I visited in a tiny house that had previously been part of the pro-Soviet Revolutionary Museum. The museum\u2019s first exhibition portrayed the Jewish experience in Lithuania during the Holocaust using horrific historical photographs to unflinchingly document the local collaboration that made it so lethal. \u201cDuring Soviet times there was no possibility to talk about or explore these questions, so we were burning with a desire to show what happened,\u201d Kostanian told me.\n\nPhoto courtesy Daniel Brook\n\nWith Soviet archives now opened, international academics also embarked on new research into Lithuania\u2019s Holocaust. Long-suppressed eyewitness accounts of local collaboration compiled at the conclusion of the war by Soviet Jewish journalists Ilya Ehrenburg and Vasily Grossman were declassified and published. Rachel Margolis, an elderly Jewish former partisan in Vilnius, found and published an eyewitness account of the execution of the city\u2019s Jews penned by a Polish Catholic journalist who lived near the killing fields. His chilling diary fingered Lithuanian volunteers as the triggermen. In the face of these additional sources, the central question that has preoccupied mainstream historians of the Holocaust since the end of the Cold War is not whether there was massive local collaboration in Lithuania but why. A 1993 academic paper on the subject was titled simply, \u201cWhy Lithuania?\u201d\n\nWith independence, the remnants of the Lithuanian-born Jewish community abroad saw an opportunity to finally prosecute the Nazi collaborators who had escaped punishment in Soviet times. This should have been relatively easy in Lithuania, since what is generally considered the archetypal depravity of the Holocaust\u2014the anonymity of tattooed prisoner numbers and transcontinental deportations to death factories\u2014was unknown in the country. Most Lithuanian Jews were shot near their hometowns. And, according to Lithuanian historian Alfonas Eidintas, the majority of them were shot by other Lithuanians, not by Germans. In Lithuania, the murderers and the murdered were sometimes even neighbors\u2014your dentist, your customer, your daughter\u2019s middle school crush. This lack of anonymity was a survivor\u2019s nightmare, but a prosecutor\u2019s dream.\n\nOne veteran Jewish partisan, Joseph Melamed, had begun compiling a list of names of collaborators from his fellow survivors in 1944. He had been born in Kaunas, Lithuania\u2019s second largest city, and remembers the vigilante killing squads that swept through the streets when the Red Army fell back in the face of the Nazi attack. \u201cThe Germans were not there; the Lithuanians did it themselves,\u201d said Melamed when we spoke in Tel Aviv (by phone; the elderly war veteran had just been admitted to a local hospital). \u201cI saw them carrying off Jews and Lithuanians standing on the sidewalks were giving them ovations, shouting \u2018Bravo! Bravo!\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cI saw them carrying off Jews and Lithuanians standing on the sidewalks were giving them ovations, shouting \u2018Bravo! Bravo!\u2019 \u201d\n\nMelamed, who became a prominent attorney and art dealer as well as head of the Association of Lithuanian Jews in Israel, redoubled his research efforts when the Soviet Union collapsed. In 1999, he published a volume titled, Crime and Punishment that listed the names of more than 4,000 Lithuanian volunteer executioners, nicknamed zydsaudys (\u201cJew-Shooters\u201d) during the war. \u201cAfter Lithuanians got independence,\u201d he told me, \u201cwe hoped that Lithuania would give us help.\u201d\n\nBut it was not to be. In one of its very first independent actions, before even fully breaking free of Moscow, Lithuania\u2019s parliament formally exonerated several Lithuanian nationalists who had collaborated in the Holocaust and had been convicted by Soviet military courts after the war. The right-wing paramilitaries who had carried out the mass murder of Lithuania\u2019s Jews were now hailed as national heroes on account of their anti-Soviet bona fides. Among many now-glorified leaders was Jonas Noreika, a paramilitary fighter who was executed for his anti-Soviet activities in 1947. According to a Holocaust survivor\u2019s account published in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel, Noreika led the extermination of the Jews in the Lithuanian city of Plunge. Since independence, however, Lithuania\u2019s prosecutor general has restricted access to Noreika\u2019s wartime files. Meanwhile, the state body charged with investigating and memorializing Nazi- and Soviet-era atrocities, the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania, turned the former guerrilla leader into a national hero. In 1997, Noreika was posthumously awarded one of the state\u2019s highest honors, the Order of the Cross of Vytis, First Degree; in 2010, a primary school was named after him. At the same time, the new authorities have denigrated the anti-Nazi partisans: the Partisans Memorial from Pylimo Street now sits in a countryside park where the despised Lenins and Stalins that once stood in every Lithuanian town are left to collect dust and bird droppings. Its Genocide Centre\u2013provided plaque says that partisans committed atrocities and were \u201cmostly of Jewish nationality [since] native people didn\u2019t support Soviet partisans.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy Daniel Brook\n\nWith independence, the grand Gestapo-turned-KGB headquarters on the central avenue in the heart of Vilnius was converted into the Museum of Genocide Victims. Initially begun in a makeshift manner by activists who occupied the local KGB headquarters when Gorbachev evacuated the Red Army in 1991, the museum became an official institution of the Lithuanian state by order of the minister of culture and education in 1992. Since 1997, it has been run by the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre. Despite its name, the institution is emphatically not a Holocaust museum. In what became a model for post-Soviet Lithuania\u2019s new party line, the museum recasts the human rights abuses of the Soviets as the \u201cgenocide,\u201d while the Holocaust is brushed under the rug, downgraded to what the permanent exhibit calls Gestapo \u201crepression against Jewish and other populations of Lithuania.\u201d Among the names carved into the museum\u2019s stone facade is Jonas Noreika\u2019s.\n\nTo Lithuania\u2019s remaining Jews, half of whom would leave the country in the 1990s, the new nation\u2019s new history was an ominous sign. But few beyond the borders of Lithuania were aware of what was happening. In public diplomacy, Lithuanian authorities made a great show\u2014and still do\u2014of a German-style reckoning with their troubled past. It wasn\u2019t until Lithuania had safely joined the European Union and NATO, in 2004, that state prosecutors began publicly tarring the Jewish partisans who fought the Nazis as betrayers of the nation.\n\n4 The Search for Collaborators\n\nYitzhak Arad defected from Soviet Lithuania in 1945 and wasn\u2019t permitted to return until the Glasnost era. When Gorbachev legalized independent Jewish cultural institutions in the Soviet Union, Arad flew to Vilnius for the opening of a community center. As the thaw continued and the Soviet Union unraveled, Arad, now chairman of Yad Vashem, became a frequent visitor to Moscow where he worked to gain access for Holocaust researchers to the Soviet wartime archives that had long hidden the truth about local collaboration.\n\nIn 1998, the Lithuanian ambassador to Israel showed up on Arad\u2019s doorstep outside Tel Aviv and invited him to participate in the new state\u2019s truth and reconciliation commission: The International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania. The young republic hoped to look honestly at the crimes of its past, the ambassador explained, and he hoped Arad, who had published extensively on the Holocaust in Lithuania would agree to serve.\n\nArad recalled that some of his fellow Lithuanian-born Jews urged him not to join arguing that the purpose of the commission was simply \u201cto whitewash the crimes the Lithuanians committed.\u201d To some, its very name presupposed a conclusion that the crimes were all committed by German and Russian occupiers rather than by Lithuanian collaborators.\n\nBut at the urging of the Israeli Foreign Ministry, Arad signed on. Arad promptly directed the commission to research some of the most uncomfortable aspects of the Holocaust in Lithuania. \u201cWe decided one subject was Lithuanian anti-Semitism before the war,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSecondly, the [role of] the Jews during the first period of the Soviet occupation and how this influenced the relationship of Lithuanians to Jews. \u2026 And then we started a third subject, the wave of pogroms initiated by Lithuanians, then we decided about the organized murder of the Jews [and finally, the relationship between] the Lithuanian church and the Holocaust.\u201d Over the next eight years, relying heavily on documents that before the collapse of the Soviet Union had been unavailable to scholars, the commission published hard-hitting research under the imprimatur of the new state, revealing that the Holocaust in Lithuania was not simply the work of bloodthirsty German invaders but was, to a remarkable degree, a local production.\n\nPhoto courtesy Daniel Brook\n\nProsecutors, however, were reluctant to take action against surviving Nazi collaborators. \u201cInstead of giving up the murderers,\u201d Melamed recounted, they \u201cstarted saying they didn\u2019t do anything at all.\u201d Under international pressure, three Lithuanian collaborators were eventually prosecuted, but all were deemed unfit for incarceration\u2014two on account of ill health, the third on account of his wife\u2019s ill health. \u201cNot a single Lithuanian war criminal has sat one day\u2014not one minute!\u2014in a Lithuanian prison since independence,\u201d the Simon Wiesenthal Center\u2019s top Nazi hunter, Ephraim Zuroff, told me in his office in Jerusalem.\n\nInstead, Lithuanian prosecutors were soon investigating Jewish partisans for alleged war crimes\u2014starting with Yitzhak Arad. On April 22, 2006, Respublika, an openly anti-Semitic newspaper that is one of Lithuania\u2019s highest-circulation dailies, published a story headlined, \u201cThe Expert With Blood on His Hands.\u201d The article used passages of Arad\u2019s memoir, The Partisan, published in English in 1979, to smear him. In the Respublika article, what Arad\u2019s memoir terms a 1944 \u201cmopping-up operation\u201d against \u201carmed Lithuanians\u201d after the Nazi withdrawal becomes an \u201cethnic cleansing of Lithuanians\u201d that was part of a larger Soviet genocide. Arad, who was a teenager during the Holocaust, is referred to as an \u201cNKVD storm trooper.\u201d The anti-Communist convictions that are evident throughout Arad\u2019s Brezhnev-era book\u2014his recounting of how Stalin crushed the organized Jewish community of Lithuania during the annexation of 1940; his description of his hometown\u2019s market turned scraggly and abandoned in the fallout from disastrous Communist economic policies\u2014go unmentioned. As for the defection of this supposedly rabid Communist from Soviet Lithuania, the article seems genuinely puzzled: \u201cIt is not evident why, but right after the war Y. Arad decided to run to the West.\u201d\n\nIn the article, Vytautas Bogusis, an anti-Soviet dissident turned ultra-nationalist member of the Lithuanian parliament, argues for a new history that posits moral equivalence between the Nazi invaders and the partisans who resisted them. \u201cThe red partisans were exactly the same occupiers as the Hitlerists,\u201d Bogusis says, \u201ctherefore I do not wonder why the inhabitants of Lithuania fought against them.\u201d The head of the Genocide Centre at the time, Arvydas Anusauskas, contends that Arad\u2019s partisan past should preclude him from being considered an impartial historian. As for bringing alleged partisan war criminals to justice, Anusauskas laments, \u201cThere is no statute of limitation for the Jewish genocide, because this is approved at the international level. The genocide of Lithuanians has no such status, and for the physical extermination of our nation essentially nobody is accountable.\u201d\n\nPhoto courtesy Daniel Brook\n\nA year later, however, Anusauskas succeeded in getting a criminal investigation of Arad under way. In September 2007, Lithuanian prosecutors announced they had opened a formal inquiry into Arad after receiving evidence of war crimes from the director of the Genocide Centre. Prosecutors publicly stated that they suspected Arad of \u201ccrimes against humanity in respect of Lithuanian residents (murder of civilians, prisoners of war, murders of Lithuanian [anti-Soviet] partisans) which were allegedly committed during \u2026 the service of said person in the Soviet NKVD in the years of World War II in Nazi occupied Lithuania and the post-war years.\u201d\n\nIn May 2008, plainclothes policemen fanned out through Lithuania looking for other Jewish partisans to interview as part of their widening war crimes investigation. The local television news announced that Vilnius police were searching for two former partisans to interview regarding Arad (though, strangely, neither of them had fought in the same region of Lithuania he had). One was Fania Brantsovsky, who worked as librarian at the Vilnius University Yiddish library. The other was Rachel Margolis, who had irked local nationalists by uncovering the eyewitness account of Lithuanian volunteers executing 70,000 Jews outside Vilnius. The prosecutors refused to guarantee that the women would not be charged. At the time, it was well known in Vilnius that Brantsovsky could be found any weekday at the university library and that Margolis spent most of the year in Israel, where her daughter had settled after the collapse of the Soviet Union, returning to Lithuania each summer to work at the city\u2019s tiny Jewish museum. But the authorities made it sound as if there might be killers on the loose, sending armed police to search for the women and notifying the media of the urgent manhunt as if armed-and-dangerous babushkas were roaming the streets of the capital.\n\nBrantsovsky was soon found and interviewed. She denied being present at the scene of any war crimes, let alone participating in them, and was released. Margolis reacted to the news from Vilnius by canceling her annual trip to Lithuania. She suffered a heart attack that summer and has never returned to her homeland.\n\nAt the retirement home near Tel Aviv, Arad observed how bizarre it was that he was targeted by the Lithuanian prosecutor, considering that \u201cthe [non-Jewish] Lithuanians in our unit became the whole government of Soviet Lithuania. They became mayors of the [major] cities, the \u2018people\u2019s commissars.\u2019 \u201d The leader of Arad\u2019s partisan unit, Motiejus Sumauskas, became the chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. \u201cBut I was an ordinary partisan. In Lithuania, even today, there are still [non-Jewish] Lithuanians who commanded me. My commanders are there. [The government] didn\u2019t come out against them. They picked me.\u201d (The Lithuanian Prosecutor General\u2019s office did not respond to requests for comment by phone and email.)\n\nThe allegations against Arad never made it to court\u2014in September 2008, the prosecutor\u2019s office announced that it had failed, as yet, to collect adequate evidence for a trial and appealed to the public for help in unearthing the crimes of Arad and his partisan unit. The investigation succeeded, however, in calling into question Arad\u2019s impartiality and moral authority. From 2006 until 2013, the international body was essentially frozen, as international scholars ceased to participate in solidarity with the embattled Arad. Though it officially relaunched in 2013 with a majority of members sending a letter to Arad \u201cexpress[ing] our sorrow and anger at the unwarranted attacks on you, which led to the suspension of the meetings of the Commission,\u201d it has yet to resume publishing the type of no-holds-barred historical research Arad had overseen. It has not held a single session since its 2013 relaunch.\n\nThe investigation also succeeded in muddling the historical narrative by positing a moral equivalence: Lithuanian paramilitaries may have paved the way for the Nazi\u2019s Holocaust, but Jewish partisans had committed atrocities that helped pave the way for the Soviet \u201cgenocide.\u201d Even Ronaldas Racinskas, the executive director of the International Commission for the Evaluation of the Crimes of the Nazi and Soviet Occupation Regimes in Lithuania, who signed the letter calling the attacks on Arad \u201cunwarranted,\u201d told me that during the 1940s \u201cin one situation [the same person] was a victim and in another a perpetrator.\u201d While there is \u201cno excuse for killing innocent people, during these times ordinary people tried to survive and some chose the Soviets and some chose the Nazis.\u201d Racinskas told me that the notion that \u201cif someone is fighting the Nazis, they\u2019re automatically given a plus\u2014I think this is a problem. \u2026 For some people the bigger evil were the Soviets.\u201d\n\nPhoto by Heinrich Hoffmann/ullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nAnne Derse, who served as U.S. ambassador to Lithuania from 2009 to 2012, believes the accusations against Arad were a calculated attempt to undermine the International Commission. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that someone was politically motivated,\u201d she told me. \u201cThe historical commission was doing some absolutely excellent work.\u201d\n\nThe Lithuanian ambassador to the United States, Zygmantas Pavilionis, sees things more conspiratorially. He claims the accusation against Arad was not the work of Lithuanian anti-Semites but rather the work of a Russian conspiracy to make Lithuania look anti-Semitic in the eyes of the world. \u201cI suspect personally that it was a nice KGB-type operation\u201d orchestrated by the \u201cKremlin-based KGB regime,\u201d the ambassador told me by phone. \u201cWhenever you have different kinds of big steps from Lithuania with rapprochement with the Jewish community, something is happening. And in this particular case, the Arad case happened when we are preparing big visit of my president to America. I see that clearly \u2026 you have some third party involved, somewhere in the East \u2026 trying to destroy the dialogue.\u201d I was taken aback at the sitting ambassador from an EU and NATO member state weaving conspiracy theories on the record. I told the ambassador that my understanding was that the attack on Arad initially came from a Lithuanian ultra-nationalist who read Arad\u2019s memoir and contacted Respublika. Pavilionis then insinuated that I, too, might be part of the Russian conspiracy albeit more as a dupe than an agent. \u201cThey [the Russians] do it in a very professional way with American journalists,\u201d he told me, with \u201cone from Chicago, one from L.A., one from Washington, in a very Hollywood style, a very professional way.\u201d\n\nWhoever is responsible for the drumbeat of investigations coming out of Lithuania, they have not stopped. Shortly after speaking with the ambassador last March, news broke that the non-Jewish Lithuanian documentary filmmaker, Saulius Berzinis, who built a video archive of Holocaust survivors\u2019 and collaborators\u2019 testimony, has received a letter from the Criminal Division of the Vilnius Police. The letter notified him that he was under investigation for slandering Lithuanian nationalist paramilitary fighters, including Jonas Noreika, as Holocaust collaborators.\n\n5 Holocaust Obfuscation\n\nI met Dovid Katz, the leading Western Jewish activist monitoring and protesting Lithuania\u2019s new approach to its history, at his apartment in Vilnius. Situated in a hilly neighborhood of stately fin-de-siecle apartment buildings, Katz\u2019s home is lined with leather-bound volumes of pre-war Yiddish books. A framed, antiquarian Yiddish parchment map of the region hangs on the living room wall. By coincidence, Katz learned after moving in, this very living room had been the main meeting space of the city\u2019s Yiddish writers\u2019 circle before the war. The musty flat has an air of mystery to it, perhaps enhanced by the fact that Katz looks like a disheveled wizard: Tall yet portly, with long black hair and a bushy black beard, Katz cuts a strikingly eccentric figure.\n\nPhoto courtesy Daniel Brook\n\nIn 1999, Katz began teaching Yiddish at Vilnius University and he has been living part-time in Vilnius ever since. As the Lithuanian government moved away from an honest reckoning with the past, Katz began to spar with the authorities. In 2009, he launched his cluttered, scrappy website, DefendingHistory.com, which keeps the world informed on the latest developments from Vilnius. The following year, he lost his university post, he says because of his activism. He remains in the city and now calls himself \u201ca dissident.\u201d\n\nIn present-day Eastern Europe, Katz explained in his Brooklyn accent, \u201cHolocaust denial\u201d is being replaced by a seemingly respectable \u201cHolocaust obfuscation.\u201d Lithuania and other Eastern European countries are embracing a \u201cdouble genocide\u201d theory that posits that both the Nazis and Soviets committed genocide. What the hypothesis lacks in intellectual honesty, it makes up for in political expediency. By positing twin genocides, Lithuanians become victims\u2014and \u201cJudeo-Bolsheviks\u201d become perpetrators\u2014in a second, mirror-image holocaust. As Ephraim Zuroff of the Wiesenthal Center summarized, \u201cIf everyone is guilty, then no one is guilty.\u201d To Leonidas Donskis, a part-Jewish Lithuanian intellectual who has served in the European Parliament in Brussels where he has opposed official Nazi/Soviet equivalence resolutions, the ultimate purpose of the \u201cdouble genocide\u201d theory is to allow Eastern European ultra-nationalists to \u201cportray the people who were killing the Jews as people who fought the Soviet regime. [It is] dangerous nonsense.\u201d As an added bonus, this historical narrative nicely fits the present moment in which Lithuania is (justifiably) more worried about Putin\u2019s Russia than Merkel\u2019s Germany.\n\n\u201cIf everyone is guilty, then no one is guilty\u201d\n\n\n\nJewish leaders who rarely visit Lithuania are likely unaware of how Lithuania\u2019s history is presented in Lithuania. The nation\u2019s diplomats very publicly celebrate their historic Jewish community when abroad. In Israel, the Lithuanian ambassador told the Jerusalem Post that it\u2019s \u201ccool\u201d to be Jewish in modern-day Lithuania; in the U.S., Ambassador Pavilionis has pushed for links between Christian Lithuanian-Americans and the Litvak diaspora, acknowledging only obliquely that such links are \u201cnot always possible in Lithuania.\u201d When well-to-do Litvak descendants visit Vilnius each summer, they travel on tour buses that stop at the city\u2019s peripheral Jewish sites, avoiding the Museum of Genocide Victims in the city\u2019s heart.\n\nI visited the Museum of Genocide Victims, on the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht. The museum\u2019s chief guide told me that the museum\u2019s name, which baldly posits that the genocide perpetrated here was committed by Russians against Lithuanians, would be changed in two to three weeks. But when I later asked the museum director what the new name would be, he seemed caught off-guard. \u201cMaybe the Terror and Resistance Museum,\u201d he offered while the chief guide backtracked, telling me that the name-change could take months and, later, that the director was \u201conly thinking about it.\u201d The museum\u2019s name remains the same.\n\n6 Swastika Equals Hammer Plus Sickle\n\nWith Arad and his international commission sidelined, the full responsibility for telling the story of the nation\u2019s horrific 20th century has fallen to Lithuanian officials. During my time in the country, I was interested to learn what the government is teaching its people about their history. I made an appointment to speak with one of the key officials, the current general director of the Genocide and Resistance Research Centre of Lithuania. The center\u2019s official emblem is a crucifix sharpened into a dagger.\n\nThe day of the interview, I walked to the center\u2019s headquarters on the edge of Vilnius\u2019 World War II\u2013era Jewish ghetto. Before my meeting with the director, her secretary eagerly showed off the winning entry of a national middle school art of remembrance competition the center had organized. It was a handmade cardboard model of a cattle car with an oaktag-mounted montage behind it. The mixed-media work was headlined with the simple math equation: swastika equals hammer plus sickle. It was the essence of \u201cdouble genocide\u201d broken down into an aphorism even a child could master.\n\nPhoto by Virgis Usinavicius/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhen I met general director Terese Birute Burauskaite, she explained to me why Soviet repressions of Lithuanian nationalists constitute genocide. \u201c[In] the human rights conventions\u2019 definition of genocide,\u201d she said, \u201cthere is no place for political groups or social groups, only for ethnic and racial groups.\u201d Under the center\u2019s broadened definition, by contrast, Stalin\u2019s targeting of social groups\u2014the intelligentsia, for example, or the capitalists\u2014can be considered genocide. (Shortly after our interview, in November 2013, Lithuania\u2019s Constitutional Court officially embraced this redefinition.) An academic paper published on the Genocide and Resistance Research Center\u2019s website went even further than Burauskaite or the court, questioning whether the Holocaust meets the standard for genocide since \u201calthough an impressive percentage of the Jews were killed by the Nazis, their ethnic group survived\u201d and later flourished. The Soviet repression, it argues, was indisputably genocide since the Lithuanian intelligentsia, eliminated by Stalin, has never regenerated.\n\nPerhaps one reason Lithuania\u2019s intelligentsia remains so stunted today is that despite the fall of Communism, open debates about the nation\u2019s history remain illegal. A 2010 law criminalized minimizing Soviet crimes, making it punishable by up to two years in prison\u2014the same term mandated for Holocaust denial. (The Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and Ukraine have similar laws.) Anyone who officially questions the government\u2019s official history in public risks jail time, as in Soviet times.\n\nPhoto by Gerard Fouet/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Genocide Centre\u2019s easy moral equivalency of swastika equals hammer plus sickle would have been even more shocking had it not been for my experience the previous day touring a partisan fort outside Vilnius with a young Lithuanian couple. I had bartered a full tank of gas\u2014nearly twice what a typical Lithuanian earns in a day\u2014for a few hours of services from a couple working as a translator and driver. Born in the late Soviet period, the underemployed artist and architect were the kind of worldly youth that should be the hope of the new Lithuania. The architect took on freelance design projects for Western European firms at Eastern European rates. The artist made ends meet creating Internet video ads for local beer brands that he was too sophisticated to drink. He was perplexed by my request to drive into the woods to see the remains of an anti-Nazi partisan fort. \u201cWhy go to a Soviet fort?\u201d he asked. \u201cThat has nothing to do with us.\u201d\n\nWe drove down a smooth, wide, EU-funded expressway for a stretch before exiting onto a narrow local street and then turning down a dirt road muddied by the Baltics\u2019 perpetual precipitation. For the partisans who escaped the Vilnius ghetto to fight here, this was a three-day walk. For us, it was a 45-minute drive. After a few minutes of sloshing down the dirt road, we came upon a clearing in the woods. I had been prepared to find a foxhole or two\u2014all my sources, both in print and in person, had called it a \u201cfort\u201d\u2014but this was much bigger, a bona fide base. Seven different rooms, arrayed in an approximate circle, had been dug out of the ground, lined with logs, and covered with crude roofs of wood, dirt, and moss. Two of the structures appeared to be in imminent danger of collapse. Inside another, the trash strewn about the floor suggested its use by local teens for parties.\n\nThe decay was, of course, the result of intentional neglect. Since it is not an official Lithuanian historic site\u2014indeed, according to the new party line, it was a hive of traitors to Lithuania\u2014the fort is not protected. It will soon be gone, much like the elderly partisans who fought in it.\n\nHeading back into Vilnius, the young couple mulled their nation\u2019s bloody history. \u201cThe Nazis were bad; the Soviets were worse,\u201d the artist offered matter-of-factly. \u201cMy grandmother remembered the war,\u201d the architect added. \u201cShe always said the Germans were polite and the Russians weren\u2019t.\u201d When I pressed her on her Soviets-were-worse-than-the-Nazis assumptions, the most she would concede was a post-modern gloss that it was all a matter of perspective. \u201cIt depends who you were: the Nazis were worse for Jews, the Soviets were worse for Lithuanians.\u201d The blithe, implicit assumption was that Lithuanian Jews were not Lithuanians.\n\n7 Someone Else\u2019s Fault\n\nI had wanted Fania Brantsovsky to show me around her old partisan fort but she declined to make the trip. Instead, I met her with my translator at the Vilnius University Yiddish library where she still works. Though in her 90s and dwarfed behind the bookshelves of aging Yiddish volumes and an old aleph-to-tav card catalog, she was a hummingbird of a woman, petite with a bright smile and a pixie cut. She repeatedly jumped up on her chair to pull down books from the top shelf that were relevant to her activities as a partisan.\n\nOne of the volumes she grabbed was Rachel Margolis\u2019 memoir, A Partisan From Vilna. I had read the book, which included a description of a partisan attack on a town called Kanyuki, and knew that, according to Margolis, Brantsovsky was present at that battle. On Page 484, Margolis wrote: \u201cA Nazi garrison was stationed in Kanyuki village. It blocked the partisans\u2019 way into the region and was very dangerous for us. The brigade high command decided to attack the garrison and send all our detachments there. Fania went on this operation with a group from Avenger Detachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not in this book,\u201d Brantsovsky told me in decent English\u2014a surprise since we had been communicating in Russian through a translator and because I knew she was mentioned in the book. Later Brantsovsky backtracked, telling my translator in Russian, \u201cShe [Margolis] wrote in the book that I was in the battle but I have documents that I was in the hospital.\u201d\n\nKanyuki is an example of a battle where war crimes were likely committed though sorting out the facts today is difficult. In her memoir, Margolis portrays the battle at Kanyuki as an act of self-defense and a great partisan victory, but there were certainly civilian casualties there. Another Jewish partisan, Paul Bagriansky, has described outright atrocities, including one Jewish partisan \u201cholding the head of a middle-aged woman against a big stone and hitting her head with another stone. Each blow was accompanied by sentences like: this is for my murdered mother, this if for my killed father, this is for my dead brother.\u201d The Kanyuki Massacre, as they term it, is a central wartime event for double genocide theorists. Even Dovid Katz admits, \u201cKanyuki was definitely a Soviet partisan excess.\u201d\n\nNo one has the right to bash a woman\u2019s head in with a rock. And fighting for the right side in a war does not permit those fighters to commit war crimes. But the point of the Lithuanian media and prosecutorial allegations against Jewish partisans is not impartial justice. The Lithuanian nationalist interest in people like Arad and places like Kanyuki, when there are sites like Paneriai, outside Vilnius, where 70,000 Jews were murdered by Lithuanian volunteers who can\u2019t claim self-defense suggests a desperation to recast the war as a violent chaos of armed Lithuanian Christians killing unarmed Lithuanian Jews and armed Lithuanian Jews killing unarmed Lithuanian Christians when it was nothing of the sort.\n\nSlate Academy: The History of American Slavery America's defining institution, as told through the lives of nine enslaved people.

The real point of the investigations of Jewish partisans is to overturn the narrative that the anti-Nazi partisans were fighting on the right side of the war. At the extremes, this is to claim that, in post-Cold War hindsight, the Nazis were the right side\u2014at least for Lithuanians. Even in the softer version that is taught to Lithuanian schoolchildren, it claims that was there was no right side.

On Friday the biggest individual spender (non\u2013dark money category) in the midterm elections suggested that\u2019s going to have to change if the Democratic front-runner wants the backing of his well-funded super PAC.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nTom Steyer, a hedge fund manager-turned-environmental activist, announced that his NextGen Climate Action group will only back candidates in 2016 who push energy policies aimed at having half of the nation\u2019s electricity generated from renewable or zero-carbon sources by 2030, and 100 percent by 2050. \u201cThat\u2019s the hurdle candidates have to get over to win our support,\u201d the billionaire told the New York Times. The creation of such a clear, public litmus test is surprising\u2014particularly since earlier this year Steyer held a private fundraiser for Clinton in his San Francisco home.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSo far this year, NextGen has largely focused its efforts on the Republican field by trying to put the candidates on record about not believing that man is a significant contributor to global warming. Friday\u2019s announcement, though, is aimed directly at the Democratic side of the field\u2014and Clinton specifically. Hillary\u2019s top two rivals are already in Steyer\u2019s good graces: Martin O\u2019Malley laid out his plans last month for a shift to 100 percent renewable electricity by the middle of this century, while Bernie Sanders often talks forcefully on the stump about what needs to be done to curb climate change. (Whether Sanders will be willing to release a specific plan tailored to NextGen\u2019s request, though, remains in question given the Vermont senator\u2019s general disdain for billionaire donors.)\n\nClinton, though, has taken a more moderate, let\u2019s-not-move-too-fast position that has angered many in the climate community, which has long been upset over her unwillingness to speak out against the Keystone XL pipeline. Clinton\u2019s strongest climate comments to date were a promise to fight to preserve the regulations being implemented by President Obama\u2019s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency at \u201call costs.\u201d That was welcome news to climate activists but hardly something for them to get excited about. They\u2019ve long pushed for Obama to go bigger on climate, and they want Clinton to make promises that go beyond more of the same.\n\nAs I\u2019ve noted before, Clinton doesn\u2019t have to pay much heed to your run-of-the-mill climate activist in the primary given that she won\u2019t have to worry about them come the general. Their legitimate fears about a climate science\u2013denying Republican president will be a much greater motivating force on Election Day than their doubts about Clinton ever could be. But Steyer\u2019s vow could force Clinton\u2019s hand. He donated $67 million of his own cash to his NextGen Climate Action super PAC in 2014 (without much to show for it). While he hasn\u2019t said how much he\u2019s willing to spend this cycle, a NextGen spokeswoman told the Times that he intends to \u201cdouble down.\u201d If he does, he\u2019ll give Clinton millions of more reasons to finally get specific on an issue she\u2019s so far been treating as a political advantage as opposed to a real-world problem.\n\nElsewhere in Slate:", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:01:55.068+0000"}

The decision effectively revives the vitriolic, acrimonious campaign against the ordinance. And it sends Houston a clear message from the state supreme court: We don\u2019t like your law.\n\nHouston\u2019s equal rights ordinance has had a troubled history from the start. In May 2014, the Houston City Council passed the ordinance to protect gay, bi, and trans people from discrimination in housing, employment, and city contracts. Opponents of the measure quickly gathered signatures to force a referendum on the law. At first, the city secretary found the petition to be valid. But further examination revealed some irregularities. A jury found that many of the signatures were forged, and a judge agreed, throwing out the petition because, when the forgeries were excluded, it had too few signatures to move forward. Following the judge and jury\u2019s findings, the city attorney ruled the petition invalid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNow, the Texas Supreme Court has reversed the decisions of the judge, jury, and city attorney. It does so under a thin veneer of law\u2014but its decision is more of a policy statement than a legal ruling. The court states that the power of referendum \u201cis the exercise by the people of the power reserved to them.\u201d That\u2019s undoubtedly correct. The court also notes that the city secretary initially certified the petition. That\u2019s true, too. But the court then ignores the fact that a judge and jury found the petition to be fraudulent, holding that by not certifying forged signatures, \u201cthe legislative power reserved to the people of Houston is not being honored.\u201d\n\nWhat? The court\u2019s grand pronouncements cloud the waters, but the facts here are pretty simple. In order to put a city ordinance to referendum, opponents must gather 17,269 signatures. Opponents of Houston\u2019s nondiscrimination law didn\u2019t do that. Instead, they gathered several thousand valid signatures and several thousand forgeries. Minus the forgeries, they failed to reach the minimum threshold of signatures. The Texas Supreme Court doesn\u2019t care. Instead, it decided for itself that the signatures were valid. Then it ordered that enforcement of the ordinance be immediately stopped and compelled the city council to consider repealing it. If the council fails to repeal it, the ordinance must be put to a popular vote in the November 2015 election.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:01:56.226+0000"}
{"entityId": 394, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Daniel Roland/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThis question originally appeared on Quora, the best answer to any question. Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.\n\nAnswer by Tim Hibbetts, A-6E, F/A-18C pilot, operational level of war planner:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe U.S. military is that house guest of dubious benefit, questionable timing, faulty manners, but impeccable credit.\n\nEvery base supports either a specific security goal or overall regional stability. Some were acquired after conflict, such as the ones in Germany, Italy, and Japan. Some were gained in support of allies in conflict, such as the ones in England and Korea. Most are simply there to reduce that tyranny of distance. But all have been considered important enough to spend significant treasure in securing, building, manning, and supporting. These bases also mostly support the host country's goals, whether security, financial, relationship, or a combination. With rare exceptions, the bases are there under agreement with the host country, with many of the host countries specifically asking for more U.S. involvement. This is usually done behind closed doors, as it doesn't read well in the local papers.\n\nEach relationship that has led to foreign basing is different, many changing in character from one decade to the next. As an example, in the aftermath of the Spanish\u2013American War, U.S. leaders felt that the newly freed Filipinos were incapable of self-rule, leaving their nation open to subjugation by another major power. This led to the U.S.'s shameful management until just prior to World War II. The postwar basing agreements were considered strategically vital to counter possible Soviet aggression in the Pacific, and the Philippine government agreed. Shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union, the Philippine government felt the crisis was over and asked the U.S. to leave, which it did. After the explosion of Mount Pinatubo, they asked the U.S. to renew the agreement. The U.S. declined.\n\nFor years, Japan's sensitivity to nuclear power kept the Nimitz-class carriers from being based there. When the last conventional carriers were slated for decommissioning, an agreement was made to shift a nuclear-powered carrier over. The fact that the U.S. made an extensive study to move the ships to Guam undoubtedly also had something to do with Japan's change of heart. Along with a big check.\n\nMost of the main bases can be traced to post\u2013World War II stabilization efforts. After its short involvement in World War I, the U.S. withdrew again to domestic and hemispheric concerns, leaving Eurasia to its own affairs\u2014disastrously, as it turned out (though U.S. involvement may have had little effect). After World War II, U.S. leaders saw a return to semi-isolationism as a mistake and instead used the influence gained in the war and the execution of the Marshall Plan as springboards to leave troops overseas. Most of the deployments supported bottling up the spread of communism. Many troops were placed in temporary bases, using host facilities for short-term missions, either in direct support of combat units or as logistics bases. Recent examples include Bagram Airfield and the former Transit Center at Manas.\n\nA list of bases and their supported missions, with host nation feelings on the matter, would be exhausting to read, much less compile. Suffice to say, the U.S. military is in a lot of places. It may just be a couple people or a whole combined combat and command unit. It's a lot.\n\nOne obvious exception, on many levels, is the U.S. base on Cuba, Guantanamo Bay Naval Base. Just as Cuba was a knife in the U.S.'s side for most of the last 50-plus years, so Gitmo has been poking the Cuban government for much longer. Why a naval base so close to U.S. shores, one that the host government does not support nor gain any material advantage from? The answer is obvious, but it is becoming more interesting as relations are finally thawing.\n\nOf note, many businesses near the larger bases see significant economic gains just from the U.S. members based there. When a large base in Germany was recently (and temporarily) placed on a base closure list, local residents protested and implored Berlin to insist on it staying. This is not universal, and many bases actually have seen significant local protests. This is especially common after service members commit crimes against the local citizens. These disgraceful acts have strategic ripples in many cases, resulting in changes to basing agreements.\n\nThe U.S. has operated out of so many locations that it's hard to nail them all down. From Eaton's Tripoli expedition in 1804 to modern drone operations, temporary positions of opportunity have drawn the U.S. to make arrangements with foreign powers. These bases will pop up and disappear with very few Americans ever noticing, such as the Pakistani bases mentioned by Balaji Viswanathan.\n\nAs the self-appointed world police, having bases all over the place does a couple things. First, if the base location doesn't deter hostility, it reduces response time, which can often reduce the required response. Second, it reduces the need for the region's allies to build up as much of a military, which fosters more stability in the region. As the economic burden continues to rise, the U.S. is reducing the size of many bases. This has sparked higher spending on defense from the countries in these areas. It hasn't led to violence, but diverting money to military spending reduces what a nation is going to spend on many other programs. This alone can be destabilizing in many countries.\n\nOpened to its full extent, this is an interesting map. It doesn't detail numbers in each country, and many of the countries have only a few personnel, but there's an obvious overtone to where U.S, interests seem to lie. Of course, military presence doesn't always equate to level of interest. For instance, there are only a couple hundred U.S. military personnel in Israel, few of whom are front-line troops. And as hot as the Taiwan issue is, there is little military interaction with the island's government.

{"entityId": 399, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "To be fair, some Republicans and a few Democrats asked legitimate critical questions about how certain aspects of this deal might play out. As a practical matter, can the P5+1 nations really reimpose sanctions if Iran cheats a few years down the road? The deal states that, if Iran is suspected of surreptitiously conducting nuclear activities in a building it hasn\u2019t declared as a nuclear site, it might take 24 days before inspectors can go in and take a look; is that too long? Could Iran hide its activities, in the meantime, without detection? And what about the detailed inspection protocols between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (which are typically classified in these sorts of deals): Do they ensure that the IAEA won\u2019t get hoodwinked?\n\nNonetheless, it\u2019s not just disrespectful (nothing wrong with that), it\u2019s just misinformed, to accuse the Western negotiators\u2014career diplomats, backed by laboratory scientists, who worked on this deal for two years, struggling nonstop for three weeks at the end to hammer out the precise language\u2014of having the wool pulled over their eyes, of being chumps and suckers, especially when the senators snapping the towels aren\u2019t the brightest lights on the block. (At one point of his you\u2019ve-been-fleeced routine, Corker allowed, \u201cWhen I was in college, I wasn\u2019t a particularly good student.\u201d)\n\nYou can like or dislike the terms of the deal. Both sides\u2014the Iranians and the leaders of the P5+1 nations (the United States, Britain, France, Russia, China, and Germany)\u2014made compromises to get the deal. Though its inspection and verification measures are as tight and thorough as any I\u2019ve seen in a deal of this sort (excepting those imposed after the military defeat of a nation), they\u2019re not absolutely airtight; there\u2019s no guarantee this will work out.\n\nBut when the Foreign Relations Committee\u2019s current chairman, Sen. Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, rips at Kerry in his opening statement, saying, \u201cI believe you\u2019ve been fleeced,\u201d thus setting the tone for what is to come (not just in this hearing but in the dozens more slated in the next two months), well, things have taken a weird turn.\n\nIt\u2019s scabrous enough when Sen. Jim Risch the junior senator from Idaho, chortles, \u201cYou guys have been bamboozled\u201d and, \u201cAnyone who believes this is a good deal joins the ranks of the most na\u00efve people in the world.\u201d You just shake your head and wonder how it\u2019s possible that someone like this could be a United States senator.\n\nI spent many hours of my youth watching, in some cases covering as a newspaper reporter, Senate hearings about nuclear arms treaties that the Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations had negotiated with the Russians. These were contentious hearings, but I don\u2019t remember anything as plainly vicious\u2014and utterly divorced from substance\u2014as the Republicans\u2019 behavior at Thursday\u2019s briefing. And the viciousness was directed not at Iran but at Obama and the witnesses at the table, including the committee\u2019s former chairman, Secretary of State John Kerry.\n\nEveryone understands this, which is why Republican critics can comfortably trash the deal without bothering to study it, certainly without weighing its benefits and risks. They can come off looking strong, pro-Israel, anti-Obama\u2014whatever pose they need to strike to win the next election\u2014without sharing the responsibility if the deal turns out badly or ceding credit if all goes well.\n\nThe whole exercise may be a \u201ccharade,\u201d as one senator huffed. Both houses of Congress will probably vote the deal down, the Republicans almost unanimously so; President Obama will veto their dissent; and there won\u2019t be enough naysayers to override him.\n\nIn this sense, though, Johnson\u2019s obsessive rambling (and it wasn\u2019t quite the hearing\u2019s nadir: That moment came when he launched into the lecture again in the second round of questioning) typified\u2014in extreme, almost comical fashion\u2014most of the jeremiads that Senate Republicans hurled at the panel of administration witnesses: They too had nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal\u2014or nothing to do with the Senate\u2019s task, which is to scrutinize the deal for the next two months, then vote it up or down.\n\nThursday\u2019s Senate hearing on the Iran nuclear deal hit its nadir when Sen. Ron Johnson, Republican from Wisconsin, lectured Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz about the dangers of an EMP bomb. Moniz, former head of the MIT Physics Department, could recite more about electromagnetic pulses in his sleep than Johnson could learn in a lifetime. But the deeper absurdity of the scene was that an EMP bomb\u2014an age-old, somewhat mythical worry in certain right-wing circles\u2014has nothing to do with the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nThese are fair questions. Kerry, Moniz, and Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary, who testified about the lifting of sanctions, supplied thorough answers, making persuasive cases that intelligence agencies would know\u2014in most cases, right away\u2014if Iran tried to cheat. But there are risks here: If a senator believes that the Iranians are hell-bent to cheat, and that the Western leaders won\u2019t muster the political will to pull out of the deal and reimpose sanctions (or take other forceful action) if they did discover the cheating, well, maybe that senator shouldn\u2019t vote for the deal. But even here, the problem wouldn\u2019t be the deal; it would be the whole enterprise of diplomacy with a nation that hasn\u2019t exactly proved itself trustworthy. To these people, no deal would be a good deal.\n\nThat seems to be the position of most Republican senators on the panel, though they shy away from admitting it: They simply don\u2019t want a deal, or they don\u2019t want a deal that President Obama has negotiated.\n\nTo the extent the Republican senators raised problems that they said they had with the deal during this hearing, their issues weren\u2019t problems at all. Corker described the administration\u2019s position as warning that there will be war \u201cunless we give Iran what they want.\u201d Kerry made hash of this caricature, noting that, before this deal, Iran had enough enriched uranium to make 10 to 12 nuclear bombs in a few months\u2019 time\u2014whereas, with the deal, it will cut its stock of enriched uranium by 98 percent, and its centrifuges by more than a half, fill its heavy-water reactor with cement, and allow the most intrusive regime of inspectors in the history of arms deals. \u201cHow is that giving them what they want?\u201d he asked in a blistering tone.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., a presidential candidate, coughed and sputtered through his script lines, denouncing the deal as \u201cirreparably flawed\u201d and Obama as having \u201crepeatedly capitulated,\u201d but when he honed on a specific problem with the deal, he fired blanks.* He cited an article of the deal in which the nuclear nations would provide \u201csecurity guidelines\u201d to Iran, to protect its machinery against sabotage. Rubio asked: If Israel tried to sabotage Iran\u2019s nuclear programs, say through a cyber-attack, does this deal require the United States to come to the defense of Iran, to take sides with Iran against Israel?\n\nKerry and Moniz looked puzzled. No, they said, these are standard safety measures, offered to every signatory of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (and Iran has signed it) that has a permissible nonmilitary nuclear program. It certainly doesn\u2019t obligate us to side with Iran against Israel.\n\nIf this is the best Rubio can do, he needs to hire better staff or maybe read up a bit.\n\nThe committee\u2019s other White House hopeful, Sen. Rand Paul, asked an interesting question. Saying that he would have preferred a more gradual, step-by-step lifting of sanctions, he wondered if this was discussed in the negotiations. Kerry said that, in fact, this was the central issue: that because of Iranian\u2019s insistence for upfront sanctions relief, the West insisted that Iran make deep cuts up front in its nuclear materials.\n\nAt this point, though, heading near the end of the 4 \u00bd hour hearing, C-SPAN 3\u2019s cameras backed up to a wide shot, revealing that, while most of the Democratic senators were still in the chamber in their seats, almost all the Republicans had gone.\n\nThese Republicans had demanded a role in this deal. Legally speaking, Congress doesn\u2019t have a say in a multinational political arrangement such as this; Obama allowed a vote under heavy pressure, including from many Democrats. But the truth is, they don\u2019t care about the substance of the deal; they don\u2019t want a balanced briefing on what it does and doesn\u2019t do. They\u2014most of them\u2014want, above all, to posture: to look pro-defense, pro-Israel, anti-Iran, and anti-Obama.\n\nIn the process, though, these senators look like they\u2019re eager for a war. I don\u2019t think they really are, but they certainly give that impression. These hearings were broadcast on Iranian TV, and according to at least one report, viewers in Tehran came away thinking these American senators seemed more hard-line than their own parliamentarians.\n\nThe real issue, which many senators are doing all they can to evade, is which is better: a deal that delays a nuclear Iran by 10 years (by some measures, 15 or 25 years), while in the meantime forcing deep cuts in its nuclear materials and infrastructure\u2014or scuttling the deal and leaving Iran with the possibility of getting a bomb in a few months (if it wants one, which isn\u2019t at all clear).\n\nYes, the deal also releases $50 billion to $100 billion of frozen Iranian assets and opens up the country to international trade for the first time in years. But the European nations sustained the sanctions that froze those assets, and that barred trade, only because they saw them as the precondition to bringing Iran to the table and negotiating a nuclear deal. The P5+1 nations, the European Union, and the U.N. Security Council have now unanimously endorsed the deal. If the U.S. Congress scuttles it, the sanctions will soon collapse as well (almost none of the frozen assets are in the United States), and we will have the worst of both worlds: a hostile Iran with lots of money and on the threshold of being a nuclear power.\n\nThe choice seems clear. The best way to fog this fact is to avoid facing up to the choice.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:02:40.458+0000"}
{"entityId": 400, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The court then turns to \u201cdeclarations from women who have had abortions\u201d in order to debunk the central tenets of Roe and Casey. These declarations include claims that \u201cwomen may receive abortions without consulting the physician beforehand and without receiving follow-up care after, that women may not be given information about the abortion procedure or its possible complications, and that the abortion clinic may function \u2018like a mill.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe appeals court concedes that \u201cthe Supreme Court has posited there are \u2018logical and biological justifications\u2019 for choosing viability as the critical point\u201d but then insists that \u201cthis choice is better left to the states, which might find their interest in protecting unborn children better served by a more consistent and certain marker than viability. Here, the North Dakota legislature has determined that the critical point for asserting its interest in potential life is the point at which an unborn child possesses a detectable heartbeat.\u201d And then the appellate judges go on to scold, federalismishly: \u201cTo substitute its own preference to that of the legislature in this area is not the proper role of a court.\u201d\n\nBut then the court appends a lengthy discussion onto the opinion, explaining to the Supreme Court that \u201cgood reasons exist for the Court to reevaluate its jurisprudence\u201d from Roe and Casey. And the reasons appear to be as follows:\n\nThe original claim proffered by the state of North Dakota was that an unborn child is \u201cviable\u201d from conception, because in vitro fertilization \u201callow[s] an embryonic unborn child to live outside the human uterus (womb) for 2 - 6 days after conception.\u201d The 8 th Circuit reluctantly determines that \u201cwe agree with the district court that [this] definition of viability differs from the Supreme Court\u2019s and thus does not create a genuine dispute as to when viability occurs.\u201d Plaintiffs win.\n\nThe resulting opinion is a sort of paean to states\u2019 rights and to bad science. It is an astonishing document to emerge from a federal appellate court. The Court of Appeals\u2014contending that both Roe and Planned Parenthood v. Casey have been seriously weakened by the Supreme Court\u2014first bemoans the fact that \u201cthe Court has yet to overrule the Roe and Casey line of cases. Thus we, as an intermediate court, are bound by those decisions.\u201d\n\nOddly, what virtually all accounts of the ruling left out was the lengthy section in which the three federal appeals court judges\u2014using a clutch of affidavits and statements and strongly worded declarations\u2014urged the Supreme Court to overturn Roe, since the Court of Appeals could not.\n\nMost news accounts noted that the federal appeals court permanently struck down the heartbeat law because the three-judge panel arrived at a similar conclusion to the district court: \u201cBecause there is no genuine dispute that [North Dakota\u2019s law] generally prohibits abortions before viability\u2014as the Supreme Court has defined that concept\u2014and because we are bound by Supreme Court precedent holding that states may not prohibit pre-viability abortions, we must affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the plaintiffs.\u201d Some accounts also pointed out that the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic can now remain open and that challenges to several 20-week abortion bans are working their way through the courts.\n\nThe North Dakota legislation was openly styled as a challenge to the continued legitimacy of Roe . Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple expressly described the law as \u201ca legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v. Wade.\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Steve Benen described this whole enterprise as North Dakota taxpayers \u201cfinancing an experiment of sorts\u2014the state would create a dubious law, knowing it would likely fail, as a political test.\u201d Had the law gone into effect, it would also have probably resulted in the closing of the state\u2019s last abortion clinic, the Red River Women\u2019s Clinic in Fargo. It can now be appealed to the full 8 th Circuit or on to the Supreme Court.\n\nRoe established that abortions were permissible pre-viability (currently at about 24 weeks into a pregnancy). As the district court originally determined two years ago, \u201c[a] woman\u2019s constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability has consistently been upheld by the United States Supreme Court for more than forty years since Roe v. Wade.\u201d The district court also determined that \u201cH.B. 1456 clearly prohibits pre-viability abortions in a very significant percentage of cases in North Dakota, thereby imposing an undue burden on women seeking to obtain an abortion.\u201d\n\nThis week, a panel of the 8 th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked North Dakota\u2019s so-called fetal heartbeat bill. At first glance, this appears to be a clear victory for abortion rights. The statute\u2014one of the strictest abortion bans in the nation\u2014prohibited, with narrow exceptions, abortions as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is often six weeks post-fertilization, sometimes before a woman knows she is pregnant. The law had been pushed through by a Republican state legislature in 2013 but was almost immediately blocked by a federal district court, which found that it clearly violated the constitutional protections afforded in Roe v. Wade.\n\nThere\u2019s more. The court cites a declaration from an obstetrician who contends that \u201ccoercion or pressure prior to the termination of pregnancy occurs with frequency.\u201d And that \u201cone woman declared her husband threatened to kick her out of the house and take her children away forever if she did not abort a pregnancy that was the product of an affair.\u201d\n\nDespite (and without reference to) years of scientific research showing that such claims are flatly untrue, the court goes on to bemoan the regrets of the women who abort without the state stepping in to stop them: \u201cOne woman reported that \u2018[t]he negative effects of my abortion resulted in ten years of mental and emotional torment.\u2019 \u2026 Another reported she \u2018suffered for years from depression, anxiety, panic attacks, low self esteem\u2019 and \u2018suicidal ideation.\u2019 \u201d For good measure the court notes that the same state expert who alleged that viability begins at conception \u201calso explained some studies support a connection between abortion and breast cancer.\u201d\n\nFinally, the appeals court feels impelled to note that both Norma McCorvey, the \u201cJane Roe\u201d of Roe v. Wade, and Sandra Cano, the \u201cMary Doe\u201d of Doe v. Bolton, came to regret their abortions.\n\nFor readers of the opinion wondering where, if anyplace, actual medical science appears in this symphony of assertions and debunked feints at science, well, the answer is, nowhere. There are no citations to the myriad serious studies debunking claimed links between abortion and breast cancer, showing no links at all between the two; data exhaustively marshaled by the National Cancer Institute, the American Cancer Society, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, all of which have refuted this association. Similarly, there is no data on the debunked claims about links between abortion and suicide and suicidal ideation or the myth of rampant \u201cpost-abortion syndrome.\u201d It\u2019s nowhere. This judicial opinion is where actual clinical science and testing have gone to die. The shorter version of this opinion could simply be titled, \u201cI know a guy who had a cousin, and this happened to her friend.\u201d\n\nAs Jessica Mason Pieklo was quick to point out about the court\u2019s argument that medical and scientific advances should force a re-examination of Roe: \u201cThis is a particularly audacious argument to make in the face of the ongoing and heavily orchestrated smear campaign against Planned Parenthood\u2019s biomedical research. The advances in medical and scientific technology that have \u2018greatly expanded our knowledge of prenatal life\u2019\u2014so that infants born at 23 weeks can sometimes survive, for example\u2014are possible thanks to fetal research like the kind under attack in the anti-Planned Parenthood campaign happening now.\u201d\n\nLast winter Kathryn Kolbert, who argued Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, pointed out in Slate that one of the nation\u2019s foremost experts on \u201cpost-abortion syndrome\u201d had not only been widely discredited in the trial courts but had actually been caught in the Texas abortion clinics case improperly coordinating with other experts putting forth the same discredited junk science in the Texas case; and that \u201cfour of the state\u2019s five expert witnesses were forced to change their testimony on the stand when confronted with emails showing they had lied about who had written their reports.\u201d\n\nThis is about so much more than the willingness of courts to accept discredited science as fact: As Kolbert wrote at the time, \u201cWe may live in an age of anti-science, in which scientific consensus on issues like climate change or the safety of vaccinations does little to move the public. But courts are tasked with evaluating evidence and credibility. They must not shirk that responsibility by simply saying experts disagree when \u2018someone in the world\u2019 disagrees with the consensus among experts.\u201d\n\nWhat the 8th Circuit panel did yesterday goes far beyond admitting evidence from a discredited \u201cexpert\u201d or two, willing to testify to conclusions that have been long debunked by serious scientific and medical organizations. This court actually used that faux science\u2014without testing or weighing it or even allowing it to be evaluated at trial\u2014to advance their argument that Roe and Casey are bad law because they just don\u2019t like them. They would just take the assertions of \u201cone doctor\u201d and \u201cone woman\u201d as proof that abortions are bad and states should regulate them however and whenever they see fit. For all their alleged faults, Roe and Casey represented judicial attempts to calibrate the complex and competing interests of medical science, state interests, pregnant women, and the unborn fetuses they carried.

{"entityId": 401, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Ramin Talaie/Getty Images\n\nHas Hillary Clinton just collapsed as a general election candidate? Judging from the most recent polls, the answer is yes. That is, if you ignore all the lessons of the last presidential election.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nOn Wednesday, Quinnipiac University released \u201cswing state polls\u201d in Colorado, Iowa, and Virginia. Far from leading or running even, Clinton was far behind her Republican rivals. Against Marco Rubio, she trailed 8 points in Colorado (38 percent to 46 percent), 8 points in Iowa (36 percent to 44 percent), and 2 points in Virginia (41 percent to 43 percent).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nVersus Jeb Bush, she trailed 5 points in Colorado (36 percent to 41 percent), 6 points in Iowa (36 percent to 42 percent), and 3 points in Virginia (39 percent to 42 percent). And matched up with Scott Walker, she trailed 9 points in Colorado (38 percent to 47 percent), 8 points in Iowa (37 percent to 45 percent), and 3 points in Virginia (40 percent to 43 percent).\n\nDriving this decline are terrible numbers on honesty and trustworthiness. In each state, solid majorities\u201462 percent in Colorado, 59 percent in Iowa, and 55 percent in Virginia\u2014say that the former secretary of state is neither honest nor trustworthy. Smaller, but still substantial majorities say she doesn\u2019t care about their \u201cneeds and problems.\u201d On all scores, Clinton is outperformed by Democratic primary competitor Sen. Bernie Sanders and Vice President Joe Biden, who isn\u2019t in the race.\n\nThere\u2019s no denying that Clinton is among the most polarizing figures in American politics, with staunch opposition from almost every Republican in the country. Add modest Democratic discontent\u2014evidenced by the surprising popularity of Sanders\u2014a series of highly publicized scandals, and Clinton\u2019s legitimate problems with secrecy, and you have a recipe for her low ratings.\n\nBut that, I think, is as far as we can go. Beyond a few generalities about Clinton\u2019s present media narrative and the overall landscape of the race, these polls just don\u2019t tell us much. If anything, the breathless media coverage of the results is a good reminder of how not to interpret polls and what everyone should have learned from coverage of the 2012 presidential election.\n\nThe big thing is that this early in an election cycle, polls don\u2019t tell us anything. They aren\u2019t predictive or especially useful. For example, at roughly this point in 2011, Barack Obama was a goner. With a net negative job approval rating, he was behind in key swing states and losing to a generic Republican in a nationwide matchup. But the election came, and the picture changed: Discontented Democrats returned to his corner, and the race tightened to a virtual tossup. With economic growth on his side, Barack Obama won, with a victory that matched those fundamentals.\n\nWith that said, if you\u2019re going to pay attention to polls at this stage of the election, then national ones are more helpful than state-by-state rankings. Simply put, what\u2019s true nationally tends to be true in the states as well. If a candidate holds an overall lead, then odds are good she holds it in swing states as well. By contrast, it\u2019s hard to extrapolate from the other direction\u2014a poll of swing states doesn\u2019t tell us much about the national picture. In other words, whether Clinton is unpopular in three particular swing states is less important than whether she\u2019s unpopular nationwide. As it stands, the most recent national poll\u2014from the Washington Post and ABC News\u2014shows her well-placed versus the other side.\n\nBut this brings us to another lesson: Ignore stand-alone polls. Any given poll could be an outlier or contain an odd result. Your best bet is to look at aggregates, which give you a better sense of the actual picture. To that point, the HuffPost Pollster aggregate national polls show Clinton with a solid lead over every Republican in the race: 49 percent versus 39 percent against Rubio, 50 percent versus 40 percent against Walker, and 51 percent versus 41 percent against Bush. These numbers will change as the Democratic and Republican primaries heat up, and by next summer when we have our respective nominees, the race should narrow considerably. In all likelihood, 2016 will be another tossup.\n\nIndeed, partisanship will drive voters to choose a side and to improve their personal opinions of their chosen candidate. Democrats who don\u2019t like Clinton now may see her as a worthy successor to Obama come October 2016. The same goes for Republicans who might hate one of their candidates, but would support him full-heartedly if he became the nominee.\n\nAt least one question comes out of all of this: If present polls are meaningless\u2014and if we should ignore most of the ones we see\u2014what should we look for to predict the shape of the election? The answer is the economy. \u201cWe consider the economy fundamental, or foundational, to presidential election outcomes,\u201d write John Sides and Lynn Vavreck in The Gamble: Choice and Chance in the 2012 Presidential Election. There\u2019s an almost linear relationship between economic growth and political success: If an incumbent party has growth, it wins; if it doesn\u2019t, it loses. Yes, this is mediated by other variables, from foreign conflicts to tenure in office. But the overall pattern holds.\n\nAnd what does 2016 look like? According to a range of economists, \u201cThe median forecast for the unemployment rate when voters go to the polls in November 2016 was 4.8 percent,\u201d which would be the \u201clowest it has been during an election since George W. Bush and Al Gore faced off in 2000, when it stood at 3.9 percent.\u201d\n\nNo, this doesn\u2019t guarantee a Democratic victory, but it doesn\u2019t hurt either.", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:02:47.449+0000"}

He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe once-and-future reality television star\u2019s visit to Texas was a made-for-TV event even by campaign standards. The cameras were rolling\u2014and the cable news channels broadcasting\u2014as Trump stepped onto the tarmac in the border town of Laredo. Shortly after, the campaign drove a busload of reporters to a destination overlooking the U.S.-Mexico border, which provided his backdrop of choice for the short press conference that followed. There, Trump spent most of his time fielding questions from reporters about immigration and his desire to build a wall along the Mexican border\u2014and much less time actually answering those questions in any detail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAsked whether he\u2019d seen evidence during his trip that Mexico is sending criminals across the border as he has repeatedly claimed, Trump didn\u2019t waver. \u201cYes, I have,\u201d he said roughly an hour after his plane had touched down and after he had spent nearly half that time traveling between the airport and his press conference. The Donald then added that he\u2019d be offering evidence to support that claim soon\u2014although he ignored several follow-ups about when that would actually happen. At another point, Trump was asked whether he\u2019d like to apologize to those Hispanics who he insulted when he claimed that many Mexican immigrants who come to the United States illegally are rapists and murders. The current GOP frontrunner\u2019s response: \u201cThey weren\u2019t insulted. The press misinterpreted my words.\u201d\n\nThrough it all, Trump maintained that he was visiting the border at great personal risk. \u201cPeople are saying, \u2018It\u2019s so dangerous, Mr. Trump.\u2019 But I have to do it, \u201d he said, one of several such comments he made during the two-and-half hours he spent in Texas. At no point, however, did Trump identify who it was that suggested the border was so dangerous, nor explain why he was unlikely to be protected by his personal security or the local police, which accompanied his massive motorcade on roads that were closed to the public. As the Washington Post pointed out Thursday, federal crime stats suggest Trump was much less likely to be killed during his visit to Laredo than if he would have stayed put in New York City.\n\nTrump\u2019s original plan included meeting with representatives from the local Border Patrol union, which had invited him to the Lone Star State to provide an up-close look at the Laredo section of the border. That meeting, though, was canceled by the union hours before it was scheduled to begin over concerns that it would be misconstrued as a political endorsement. The decision denied Trump the Border Patrol-themed photo-op he wanted, but, Trump being Trump, he didn\u2019t let it go to waste. In a statement before he landed, his campaign said that the local agents were \u201cbeing silenced\u201d by their national union leaders. \u201cIt can only be assumed,\u201d the campaign said, \u201cthat there are things the politicians in Washington do not want Americans to see or discuss.\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Slate: The Case for Covering Trump: Why the media shouldn\u2019t ignore his doomed campaign.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:02:49.883+0000"}

During a presidency marked by turmoil in the Middle East, a \u201cpivot\u201d to Asia, confrontation with Russia, an economic crisis in Europe, and\u2014more recently\u2014an opening to a longtime foe in Latin America, Africa has generally been a lower priority, something even his aides have at times acknowledged. Polls show the president is still more popular in Africa than in any other region, though it\u2019s also where his image has suffered the steepest declines since 2008, due largely to disappointment that he hasn\u2019t made the region more of a priority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nObama will likely leave office with less of a legacy on the continent than his predecessor George W. Bush, who has been widely praised since he left office even by many of his staunchest detractors for the success of his \u201cPresident\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\u201d initiative. Obama\u2019s signature Africa initiative, the $7 billion electrification project known as Power Africa, was the subject of a harsh critique in the New York Times this week: \u201cThe reality of Power Africa\u2019s promise bears little resemblance to the president\u2019s soaring words. It has yet to deliver any electricity.\u201d\n\nReflecting on Obama\u2019s Africa record, the Center for American Progress\u2019s John Norris argues that the fact that Obama wasn\u2019t the savior some were unrealistically hoping for may have been a good thing. \u201cThe greatest shift in the relationship between the United States and Africa over the length of the Obama administration has been the increasing recognition among most African countries that foreign aid alone will not drive lasting economic growth and prosperity,\u201d he writes.\n\nObama will attempt to hammer that message home this week in a trip focused on trade and investment, including a speech at a Global Entrepreneurship Summit in Kenya on Saturday. (Kenya is nicknamed the Silicon Savannah for its emerging tech sector.) But that won\u2019t make the trip less tricky.\n\nSpeculation is rampant over whether the president will pay a visit to his ancestral homeland in the country\u2019s west, though U.S. officials are probably already on edge over security concerns so they may not let him stray to far from the agenda. Kenyans have also been pushing back online against U.S. media coverage portraying the country as a hotbed of terrorism ahead of the visit.\n\nObama has angered some Kenyans by skipping the country on previous trips to Africa. His decision to do so was probably in part driven by a reluctance to be used as a prop in Kenya\u2019s contentious political battles, particularly after the election of President Uhuru Kenyatta in 2008. Before his election, Kenyatta had been indicted by the International Criminal Court for his alleged role in Kenya\u2019s 2007-2008 post-election violence, though the charges were subsequently dropped. Kenyatta will no doubt roll out the red carpet for Obama, though the presence of his deputy William Ruto, who is still under indictment, could be awkward. Kenyatta says his talks with Obama will focus on combating violent extremism, though human rights groups will call on the president to bring up reports that the country is cracking down unjustly on Somalis as part of its counterterrorism efforts. (After Kenya, Obama will pay a visit to Ethiopia where activists are also calling for him to speak out on human rights concerns.)", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:02:52.912+0000"}

Walker/Getty Images and,Chris Condon/PGA TOUR/MetLife Blimp.\n\nLast week in Laconia, New Hampshire, the never-laconic Donald Trump addressed a well-attended campaign rally. Answering a question from the audience about small businesses, Trump non-sequitured into a conversation he\u2019d had with a member of the Trump National Doral golf club in Florida, which he bought out of bankruptcy in 2012 and renovated. \u201cYou know, Mr. Trump,\u201d Trump recounted the man saying, \u201cif you could do the same thing for the country as you did at Doral in Miami, it would be unbelievable.\u201d\n\nSwitching back to the first person, the candidate told the standing-room-only crowd, \u201cAnd I can. I can!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis week, I spent a few nights at the Trump National Doral, a golf club\u2013cum\u2013resort hotel near the Miami airport, hoping to get a preview of what a Trump turnaround job on America might look like. At the slab marble reception desk, I was greeted by a framed portrait of Trump, grinning and pointing at me with his trademark (but not trademarked) \u201cyou\u2019re fired\u201d gesture. I tried to envision the photo framed in every federal building and looking down on every airport customs line, welcoming the world to the United States.\n\n\u201cIf you could do the same thing for the country as you did at Doral in Miami, it would be unbelievable.\"\n\nThe d\u00e9cor of the Trump National Doral might be best described as Fallen Empire. The reception building is held up by ersatz Roman columns; a discus-throwing nude adorns the roof of the clubhouse; the rooms boast Sun King mirrors; and, lest we forget, the whole idea of building golf courses in the tropics was an innovation of the late British Empire. Some of the imperial touches are distinctly American, however. We might not be able to build a high-speed rail system to compete with China\u2019s or an education system to match Singapore\u2019s, but is any nation our rival in golf course design? The Trump National Doral boasts 90 manicured holes. I admittedly know little about golf, but my back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this is fully five times as many holes as the game requires. I suspect this must make playing on Trump\u2019s course five times better.\n\nOn the stump, Trump speaks frequently about making the American Dream \u201cbigger and better and stronger than ever before,\u201d and his devotion to American industry is on display at the Trump National Doral. On the menu at the on-site steakhouse, the featured draft is listed as \u201cBud Light, Missouri.\u201d Could there be any more patriotic pairing for the $92 \u201cAmerican Kobe Rib Eye?\u201d\n\nDespite Trump\u2019s nativist leanings, that American steak will almost certainly be brought to your table by a Latin American, as nearly all of the staff at the Trump National Doral are Latino immigrants. I know this because all Trump National Doral employees have their nation of origin embossed on their nametags. (\u201cI have so many Hispanics, and they love me,\u201d Trump boasted in New Hampshire. \u201cI have thousands! I have thousands!\u201d) Presumably, all of the employees at the Trump National Doral have been thoroughly vetted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement and their names checked against Miami-Dade County\u2019s strictest-in-the-nation sex offender registry.\n\nTrump\u2019s lead over the wide Republican field took a bit of a hit recently after the candidate disparaged John McCain\u2019s heroism, saying that the former prisoner of war was only a hero because he\u2019d been captured by the enemy. At the Trump National Doral, Trump honors American heroes made of stronger stuff, men who earned their fame before they got caught: The shiny gold lettering on the \u201cTiger Woods Villa\u201d is buffed to a high sheen. Of course, no American hero is more glorified at the Trump National Doral than Trump himself. The carpeting in each room features a pattern of interlocking T\u2019s. And since nothing is more American than a hereditary coat of arms, the Trump family seal, with its suit of armor, clenched fist, and raised spear, is ubiquitous\u2014imprinted on napkins, carved into buildings, emblazoned on bathrobes. There\u2019s even one at the bottom of each trash bin.\n\nAlas, few among us will ever enjoy Donald Trump\u2019s success\u2014most of us would be happy just to have his six-figure pension from the Screen Actors Guild. But at the Trump National Doral, guests can live like a Trump for a night or two. The brass-capped Trump Hotel Collection shampoo and conditioner gave my hair a high-altitude boost, though maybe that was just a trick of the Sun King mirrors\u2014a Trump l\u2019oeil effect, if you will.

(Ha ha, \"hound.\")\n\n\n\nHere, for your recollection and edification, is the original 2003 quote:\n\nIn every society, the definition of marriage has not ever to my knowledge included homosexuality. That's not to pick on homosexuality. [Marriage] is not, you know, man on child, man on dog, or whatever the case may be. It is one thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nDuring Wednesday's interview on MSNBC, Maddow and Santorum got around to the subject as he was trying to avoid saying whether he saw sexuality as a choice, claiming that \"I don't spend a whole lot of time thinking about these things, to be very honest with you.\" Maddow greeted that answer with visible disbelief: \"You talk about gay rights all the time. That's the whole reason you were a nationally famous figure before you ever ran for president.\" She then challenged him directly over the \"man on dog\" remark, which Santorum made while equating a sodomy ban struck down by the Supreme Court with laws preventing pedophilia and bestiality. \"Why did you say the word dog?\" she asked.\n\nSantorum, after first attributing the characterization to a 1986 Supreme Court opinion that makes no mention of dogs or any other animal, finally told Maddow, \"Trust me, I wish I'd never said that.\"\n\nIt was a flippant comment made to a reporter who was not being particularly professional, in my opinion, in the way she was conducting her interview, but that's not an excuse for me. I take responsibility for what I said ... It was a flippant comment that should not have come out of my mouth. But the substance of what I said, which is what I've referred to, I stand by that. I wish I had not said it in the flippant term that I did and I know people were offended by it and I wish I hadn't said it.\n\nMaddow also questioned Santorum about the role he envisioned for the Supreme Court after playing a video of him telling a cheering crowd that the Supreme Court doesn't \"have the final say on everything\u2014the people have the final say on everything.\" Asked whether he thought that, in spite of last month's Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, Congress could pass a national ban on same-sex marriage, Santorum replied that Congress was free to pass any law it cared to, regardless of previous Supreme Court rulings:\n\nWhen I took my oath as a United States senator, what did I say? I would uphold the Constitution. And my feeling is, and I think it's, clearly, from our founding documents, that Congress has a right to say what's constitutional, the president has a right to say what's constitutional, and that's part of the dynamic that's called checks and balances.\n\nSantorum's appearance on Maddow's show might seem incongruous, given what she described as their disagreement on \"almost everything,\" but the liberal Maddow has previously called Santorum the most \"effective\" and \"natural\" communicator in the 2016 GOP field and criticized Fox's choice to freeze Santorum and other candidates out of the debate scheduled for Aug. 6 because of their low standings in national polls.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:03:15.838+0000"}

Bernstein/Reuters.\n\nWe interrupt the Donald Trump cavalcade to present you with a story you will not read. It\u2019s about Ohio Gov. John Kasich and not Donald Trump. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want you to read it. I just fear that what\u2019s true of the polls is true of readers. Trump sells, as the Washington Post\u2019s Philip Bump points out. So this piece might suffer the same fate candidate John Kasich faces for the moment. It\u2019s going to languish at the bottom of the rankings\u2014Trumped.\n\nGov. Kasich announced his presidential candidacy Tuesday. It was overshadowed by the good ship Trump. The real estate mogul gave out Sen. Lindsey Graham\u2019s cellphone number after Graham repeatedly called Trump a \u201cjackass.\u201d Trump took umbrage at being called a jackass, but he didn\u2019t have to. Lyndon Johnson suggested that being that brand of barnyard animal is good training for the presidency. \u201cBeing president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm,\u201d LBJ said; \"\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to do but to stand there and take it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTrump\u2019s rise in the polls and Kasich\u2019s position near the bottom offers a stark demonstration of the difference between campaigns as entertainment and campaigns as a vehicle for selecting qualified presidents\u2014which is nominally what campaigns are supposed to be but never really have been. (Donald Trump would have loved how William Henry Harrison did things in 1840 in what was arguably the start of our modern circus.)\n\n\u201cA total lightweight,\u201d Trump said in reference to Graham. \u201cHere\u2019s a guy\u2014in the private sector he couldn\u2019t get a job.\u201d Trump heralds his own private-sector greatness as proof he would make a good president. If his competitors would never last a day in the private sector, perhaps we should turn to the private sector to guide us. What if we evaluated Trump and Kasich as a hiring committee would evaluate job applicants? We would look at the skills required for the job and measure whether either one of them had those skills. If this were really the way we did things in a presidential campaign, Kasich and not Trump would be getting the attention.\n\nBoth men have executive skills. They can make decisions. But Kasich has executive decision skills in a venue that approximates the one we\u2019re hiring him for. Trump has made decisions in the private sector, but the public sector doesn\u2019t approximate the private one. This is a lesson all titans of the private sector learn when they come into government. Secretary of State George Shultz put it best: \u201cI learned in business that you had to be very careful when you told somebody that\u2019s working for you to do something, because the chances were very high he\u2019d do it. In government, you don\u2019t have to worry about that.\u201d\n\nThe promise of a Trump presidency is that he will be able to do things simply by asserting that he can\u2014he\u2019ll whip China, terrify ISIS into surrender, pacify Putin, and fence the border. To say it is so is to make it so. That\u2019s the way it works for Trump in business. But presidents from Lincoln to Reagan to Clinton to Bush have testified that the greatest surprise of the office is when they learn how little power they have. This isn\u2019t because these past presidents are weak, it\u2019s just that the job as the founders designed it is not all powerful.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that Donald Trump could adapt his talents to the new environment, but he\u2019s not making the case that he will be able to. He\u2019s saying being a deal maker is all he needs to be. In Trump, we have a job applicant who is selling himself for a job by trying to convince us the job is different than the one we\u2019re hiring him for. This should make the hiring committee suspicious.\n\nIt\u2019s also important for a president to know how to work within a vast organization. Trump has done that and so has Kasich. You must know how to convey your will to other people and put yourself in their shoes. Clearly Trump knows how to convey his will (and his id). It\u2019s the second part that is a problem. The people a president deals with are politicians. Kasich has worked as both an executive and a legislator. He was budget chairman in Congress the last time the budget was balanced and he served on the Armed Services Committee for 18 years. Since the presidency requires familiarity with politics and politicians, he has to be given the advantage in dealing with the kinds of people he\u2019ll be forced to deal with in Washington.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, has spent the last several weeks torching Republicans he\u2019s running against. He started this cycle by shredding Reagan\u2019s 11th commandment, \u201cThou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican.\u201d He\u2019s not showing us that he plays well with others who cross him (as politicians regularly do) or has the capacity to.\n\nAccording to polls, Trump has a higher disapproval rating than approval rating among general election voters. Kasich has a 60 percent approval rating in Ohio, a key general-election battleground state. Political popularity is not exactly an attribute of being president, but being popular sure helps get the job done. In 2014, Kasich won re-election with 64 percent of the vote, running essentially unopposed, with 60 percent of the female vote and 51 percent of union households.\n\nTrump\u2019s most attractive quality is that he could be disruptive. But we\u2019re hiring him for a job where we know people are risk-averse. Though people are unsatisfied with American politics, they\u2019re not keen on massive shake-ups, roiled markets from whipsaw decisions, and lots of exciting brink-of-disaster gambles. \u201cYou're fired!\u201d doesn\u2019t work in the presidential context. It makes people feel like the ship doesn\u2019t have a crew. Just ask Jimmy Carter, who in the summer of 1979 asked for the resignation of his cabinet and senior White House staff\u201434 people in all.

And in Virginia, Clinton trails Walker and Bush both by 3 points, and Rubio by 2 points\u2014although given the survey\u2019s margins of error, those match-ups are too close for the pollsters to call either way.

In Iowa, for example, voters were largely split down the middle in April, with 45 percent saying they viewed her favorably compared to 47 percent who said they didn\u2019t. Flash-forward to July, and only 23 percent had a favorable view of her compared to the 56 percent who had an unfavorable one. Just how concerned should Hillary be about her 23-point gap?

Stewart joked that the president, who has 18 months left in office, is also suffering from \u201csenioritis.\u201d But Obama seemed eager to use this final opportunity in front of one of his most passionate constituencies to burnish his legacy. He was most forceful and talked at most length in going after critics of his recently struck Iran nuclear deal, which faces a possible vote in Congress. Throughout the interview, Obama tried to portray critics of the deal as eager to be \u201creprising some of the same positions that we saw during the Iraq war\u201d that led to that disastrous conflict. He implied that when critics of the deal\u2014such as every major Republican candidate for president\u2014are asked what they would do instead, the answers lead back to the mistakes of the past, referencing one of Stewart\u2019s favorite boogeymen. \u201cTypically, they\u2019re vague and they fall back on \u2018well, if you had beat your chest a little more\u2014or if you had brought Dick Cheney to the negotiations, then everything would be fine,\u2019 \u201d Obama said.

It didn\u2019t matter that he later claimed he was referring to people who held part-time jobs but wanted full-time ones. Hillary Clinton condemned the remarks immediately\u2014and then came back for seconds, mentioning it again in an economic policy speech last week in New York. \u201cHe must not have met very many American workers,\u201d she sniffed. Didn\u2019t he know Americans already work plenty hard\u2014harder, in fact\u2014than people in any comparable nation? This issue had to be a winner for the left.\n\nIf only. Unfortunately, the evidence shows that quite of few of us might well agree with Jeb Bush. Even as the hours we work, and for what pay, and under what conditions, are shaping up to form one of the defining issues of the last year and a half of Obama\u2019s presidency and the 2016 presidential election, it seems we\u2019re not convinced that there\u2019s actually a problem with our work, beyond that we don\u2019t do enough of it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe United States is famously a nation of people who think they should be on the job\u2014and be on the job and be on the job. We work more hours than the Japanese. We work more than the Germans. We\u2019re the only first-world nation that does not mandate vacation time or sick days. And let\u2019s not even discuss our maternity leave policies.\n\nYet we don\u2019t seem to be aware of how second-tier our standards are compared to other nations. According to a poll released by Rasmussen last week, an astonishing 48 percent of us think Americans either work as hard as those in other countries or, even worse, put less hours in on the job.\n\nIn an era in which decent, high-paying jobs are hard to find, gainful employment turns into something of a status item.\n\nSure, we know that we, ourselves, are working exorbitant hours. A recent Gallup survey found the average American working a full-time job claimed to be putting in not 40 but 47 hours a week. Almost 1 in 5 said he or she spent more than 60 hours a week on the job.\n\nBut we\u2019re not the issue. For all too many of us, the issue is everyone else. If you don\u2019t\n\ntake part in this orgy of work and more work? Something must be wrong with you\u2014 and that\u2019s you, specifically. A survey conducted last year by the Pew Charitable Trusts found that just under a quarter of Americans are convinced the main cause of income inequality is that \u201csome work harder than others.\u201d In fact, the survey also found that 73 percent of Americans say working hard is vital to \u201cgetting ahead in life,\u201d a sentiment that less than half the Germans or Japanese share.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to see how Americans arrive at this belief. On Wall Street, 100-hour workweeks are so considered par for the course that Goldman Sachs recently instituted a rule that interns must leave the office between midnight and 7 a.m. This decision came shortly after a young analyst for the bank committed suicide while under intense work pressure, and a few years after a 21-year-old intern at a rival bank died after pulling a succession of all-nighters. The situation is little better in Silicon Valley, where Mark Zuckerberg claimed in a chat on Facebook earlier this year that he works \u201cno more than 50-60 hours a week,\u201d and Sheryl Sandberg admits that while she leaves work at 5:30 p.m., that doesn\u2019t prevent her from logging on to catch up after dinner with her children.

Italy, the judges ruled in favor of three same-sex couples who had brought the case against the Italian government, unanimously agreeing that Italy, in failing to make available \u201ca specific legal framework providing for the recognition and protection of same-sex unions,\u201d was in violation of Article 8 of the ECHR.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nArticle 8 of the Convention states that \u201ceveryone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home, and his correspondence.\u201d While Article 8 was written to protect people from \u201cinterference by a public authority\u201d in the exercise of these rights, the court determined that it also put upon European governments \u201ccertain positive obligations to ensure effective respect for the rights protected by Article 8,\u201d including \u201ca legal framework\u201d for same-sex couples to have their relationships \u201crecognized and protected.\u201d\n\nIn its judgment, the court noted that \u201csame-sex couples are just as capable as different-sex couples of entering into stable, committed relationships\u201d and that a majority of states party to the ECHR have already enacted legislation permitting same-sex couples to have their union recognized, either as a marriage, civil union, or registered partnerships. The rapid development of the move towards recognition of same-sex unions in the United States was also taken into account.\n\nSame-sex couples in Italy currently have no satisfactory legal avenue to achieve recognition of their relationships, including civil unions or registered partnerships. Efforts by the Italian government led by Prime Minister Matteo Renzi to pass legislation recognizing same-sex civil partnerships in the past few months have stalled in the face of conservative opposition. The court\u2019s finding should provide the necessary pressure to finally get this thing done and give gay and lesbian couples in Italy the status and dignity they require.\n\nImportantly, what this ruling did not do was determine that there is a legal right to same-sex marriage, specifically. This issue had previously been brought to the ECtHR in 2010 in the case of Schalk and Kopf v. Austria, and it was ruled at that time that Article 12 of the ECHR\u2014\u201cmen and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family\u201d\u2014did not extend to imposing on European states the demand to recognize marriage for same-sex couples.\n\nThe applicants in Oliari and Others v. Italy challenged Article 12 again, in conjunction with Article 14 that prohibits discrimination, arguing among other things that \u201cto persist on denying certain rights to same-sex couples only continued to marginalize and stigmatize a minority group in favor of a majority with discriminatory tendencies.\u201d The Court\u2019s mind was not changed, however. The judges stated that while the wording of Article 12 does not limit marriage to one man and one woman, it also \u201cdoes not impose an obligation on the respondent Government\u201d\u2014in this case, Italy\u2014\u201cto grant a same-sex couple access to marriage.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:05:25.533+0000"}

{"entityId": 417, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images\n\nThe fact that Jeb Bush isn't prone to saying colorfully insane things about immigrants, the economy, or foreign policy may turn out to be his most important virtue as a Republican presidential candidate. Donald Trump natters on about Mexican rapists and John McCain's war record. Scott Walker says he'll tear up President Obama's Iran deal on Inauguration Day. And Bush looks mellow by comparison. Meanwhile, he's famously refused to sign on to Grover Norquist's no-new-taxes pledge, and, unlike 2012's crop of GOP contenders, said he'd trade $1 of revenue increases for $10 in spending cuts\u2014which qualifies him as a pragmatist by conservative standards. His biggest misstep so far may have been suggesting that Americans will need to work longer hours if we want the economy to grow faster, which, a bit of outraged liberal chatter aside, wasn't especially exciting.\n\n\n\nJordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.\n\nSo Bush has managed to clear the ankle-high bar of looking relatively adult in the quadrennial freak show known as the Republican primary. This is not the same, however, as demonstrating that his ideas are particularly thoughtful or moderate. While he breaks with his party's rabid base on immigration and education, when it comes to the all-important issues regarding the size and role of government, his positions seem to be GOP boilerplate mixed with a dash of hardcore conservative fantasy, all dressed up with some rhetorical gimmicks. Bush might be the grown-up in the room. But you have to consider the room.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTake the speech Bush delivered Monday in Tallahassee, Florida, in which he outlined plans for shaking up Washington. First on his to-do list: a balanced budget amendment. This is the sort of idea that has somehow transformed into a mundane perennial of our political discourse, even though it is, in fact, an objectively radical concept that would deeply alter just about everything about how our government and economy function. This is in part because it is also treated as a harmless flight of fancy. Constitutional amendments, after all, are not really proposals. They are shiny objects politicians dangle in front of supporters whose intelligence they don't particularly respect, because passing legislation that requires a two-thirds majority in Congress and ratification by the states is not something that happens in a polarized political environment. But by rehashing this old trope, Bush is acknowledging, albeit in the most boring possible way, that he shares the Republican base's radically austere vision of government.\n\nNext, Bush would like a line-item veto to make it easier to scratch out supposedly wasteful spending programs. The trouble is that the Supreme Court struck down the original line-item veto, which gave the president unilateral power to nix budget items, as unconstitutional back in the 1990s. Paul Ryan has proposed a watered-down, \"constitutionally sound\" version, which would basically help the president to suggest specific cuts for Congress to vote on. While not exactly a sea change, it would tip the legislative process further in favor of those who favor budget cuts.\n\n\n\nLike many conservatives, Bush is also convinced that the 2.1 million-strong federal workforce is a bloated and wasteful bureaucracy that should be trimmed. And so, like others have proposed before, he wants to reduce its size by 10 percent over the next four years through attrition. For every three employees who retire, he would only allow agencies to hire one new staffer. That's roughly 200,000 jobs, spread without rhyme or reason across the federal government. Inexplicably, Bush says the reductions would save billions of dollars \"without adding to unemployment,\" which is pretty obviously untrue in the short-term, since cutting back on government hiring will reduce the number of new jobs available each month.\n\nWhat else would Bush like to do? This is where things largely turn to inane anti-establishment posturing (as can only be delivered by the establishment GOP's favored candidate and relative of two former presidents). Bush says he would try to limit the influence of lobbyists in Washington, in part by making it harder for former lawmakers to go through the revolving door. This might seem more sincere coming from a man who wasn't presently raking in donations from K Street. He also wants to fine Congress members who miss votes. Because the big problem with Capitol Hill is apparently that members aren't there to vote on repealing Obamacare yet another time.\n\nThe same way Bush's deeply conservative positions on federal spending are orthodox enough so as not to arouse much controversy, his proposals for ethics reform are banal and unrealistic enough not to generate outsize attention. The same goes his bumper-sticker-ready goal of magically achieving 4 percent economic growth every year, which is sort of the public policy equivalent of making a New Year's resolution to lose 25 pounds by beach season. Is it silly? Sure. But not in an extravagant, headline-grabbing way.\n\n", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:05:44.523+0000"}

Gotta see #StraightOuttaCompton \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 21, 2015\n\nIf you've followed Rubio's public statements, his enthusiasm for the movie isn't surprising\u2014he's called \"Straight Outta Compton\" (the song) one of his three favorite rap tracks and generally seems to have a broad knowledge of hip-hop history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nRubio and NWA are an odd match\u2014for fairly obvious reasons. Rubio is a cheerful Republican politician, and NWA were angry obscenity-case rappers whose name stands for Niggaz Wit Attitudes. \"Straight Outta Compton\" itself is a celebration of killing people with automatic weapons, getting \"pussy,\" and referring to women using such terms as \"slut,\" \"bitch,\" and \"dirty-ass ho.\"\n\n\n\nIt's not really that unusual for a politician to praise a song that tends to undermine that politician's stated ideals and/or an artist who would never vote for him. It's also possible to enjoy a work of art while being uncomfortable with some of the attitudes that art expresses, and to understand that artists sometimes adopt personas that don't reflect their true beliefs about moral behavior. (To the best of anyone's knowledge, for instance, Ice Cube has never actually killed any \"punk motherfuckers\" with a machine gun.) Rubio furthermore isn't using \"Straight Outta Compton\" as his official campaign song or claiming it represents his views\u2014he's just saying he likes it.\n\n\n\nStill, I can't help but wonder if Rubio understands the depth of the dissonance here\u2014which, in short, is about the legacy of Ronald Reagan. Marco Rubio loves Reagan. He's often compared (by his supporters) to Reagan and is happy to encourage those comparisons. Here's part of a speech he gave in 2011 at the Reagan Presidential Library in California:\n\nI tell people all the time that I was born and raised in Ronald Reagan\u2019s America. I was raised in Ronald Reagan\u2019s America. He was elected when I was in fourth grade and he left office when I was in high school. Those are very important years, fourth grade through high school, they were the years that formed so much of what today what I believe and know to be true about the world and about our nation.\n\nThe members of NWA were also born and raised in Ronald Reagan's America. Reagan was the governor of California when they were children and the president when they were teenagers and young men. For them, Reagan's America was not a good one. More than any other American leader, Reagan was responsible for popularizing resentment of welfare recipients and creating the modern war on drugs. As president, he treated poor black people as threats to be governed with force. And whether or not you think Reagan's actions were justifiable, it's impossible to deny that they are exactly what NWA was angry about. The song that followed \"Straight Outta Compton\" on its album release was called \"Fuck Tha Police.\" The first movie Ice Cube appeared in, 1991's Boyz n Da Hood, uses Reagan/Bush campaign posters as an ironic emblem of destitution. Ice Cube has said often that he blames Reagan-era budget cuts to sports and after-school programs for leaving children growing up in his neighborhood with few ways to pass the time besides getting involved with the drug trade. And he's said \"Reaganomics\" will be specifically addressed in the Straight Outta Compton film that Rubio is clearing his schedule for.\n\n\n\nThe contrast between Rubio and his favorite rappers' views of Ronald Reagan is not just academic. The legacy of Reagan's criminal justice policies\u2014which were for the most part also Bill Clinton's criminal justice policies\u2014is now one of the U.S.'s most pressing issues. President Obama's Justice Department has made major attempts to reduce racially biased sentencing disparities and prevent police brutality, while just last week Obama announced that he would like to reduce the number of people in prison and improve the way they are treated. The next president is going to have to decide whether to continue, accelerate, or reverse Obama's reforms.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:05:45.624+0000"}

Period. There is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOne thing that stands out in the response is the odd partisanship around military service. In 2004, for instance, there was a place in the Republican Party for comments that disparage those who served honorably. Many Republican leaders and officials, like then\u2013Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, supported the \u201cSwift Boat\u201d attacks against John Kerry\u2019s war record. (McCain was a notable exception at the time).\n\nMore significantly, there\u2019s the fact that this was the tipping point for anti-Trump Republicans, and not his aggressive xenophobia. For the past month, Trump has used racist invective and know-nothing nativism to build a platform in the Republican presidential primary. Like the most famous provocateurs of the Obama era\u2014from Sarah Palin and Glenn Beck to Rush Limbaugh and Dinesh D\u2019Souza\u2014he\u2019s indulged the worst, most paranoid parts of the Republican base, feeding the fear and anxiety unleashed by economic insecurity and rapid social change.\n\nThe whole time, mainstream Republicans were silent. The same figures who pounced on their opponents for slight missteps were unwilling to denounce Trump for his racism. Up until his attack on McCain, the collective Republican Party response to Donald Trump was somewhere between silence and qualified defense; at Politico Magazine, for example, National Review editor Rich Lowry wrote that Trump \u201chad a point\u201d when he said Mexico isn\u2019t \u201csending their best,\u201d ignoring Trump\u2019s claim that those immigrants are violent criminals.\n\nBut now, Republicans are criticizing Trump and for most observers, this means the beginning of the end for his stunt campaign. \u201cThe Trump portion of the 2016 race may be long remembered, though like the birther saga of the last cycle, there will be little of use to reflect upon,\u201d writes Rick Klein of ABC News. \u201cIn any event, it\u2019s winding down now, or so it would appear, in predictable if not quite painless fashion.\u201d\n\nTrump isn\u2019t a meaningless sideshow that will disappear after a few offensive remarks.\n\nBut as much as this seems true, I think it\u2019s premature, even after Trump doxed fellow GOP candidate and close McCain friend Lindsey Graham on Tuesday. At this point, there\u2019s no hard evidence that pro-Trump Republicans have left his stable. While there\u2019s still time for an anti-Trump backlash, the present fact is that he was more popular than ever when he attacked McCain. According to a new poll from ABC News and the Washington Post, Trump was the favorite for 24 percent of registered Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, the largest lead of any GOP candidate this year.\n\nThere are caveats: It was a weekend poll, and we don\u2019t have a full response to the McCain remarks. Also, his support dropped over the course of the survey. And there\u2019s the broader point that Trump\u2019s surge is as much about media attention as it is about his campaign or his rhetoric.\n\nAt the same time, Trump isn\u2019t a meaningless sideshow that will disappear after a few offensive remarks. \u201cHe has exposed and exploited the Republican Party\u2019s two great weaknesses,\u201d writes Ryan Lizza for the New Yorker, \u201cthe fact that many of its voters don\u2019t agree with Party leaders on immigration and the fact that the Party is powerless to do much about it.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll add something else: For the past eight years, an ecosystem of pundits, politicians, and provocateurs has spun a web of conspiracies about the president.

{"entityId": 422, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nA few years ago, the notion of hacking a car or truck over the Internet to control steering and brakes seemed like a bad plot point from CSI: Cyber. Today, the security research community has proven it to be a real possibility, and it\u2019s one that at least two U.S. senators won\u2019t wait to see play out with real victims.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, Sens. Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal plan to introduce new legislation that\u2019s designed to require cars sold in the U.S. to meet certain standards of protection against digital attacks and privacy. The legislation, as described to Wired by a Markey staffer, would call on the National Highway Safety and Transportation Administration and the Federal Trade Commission to together create new standards that automakers would be required to meet in terms of both their vehicles\u2019 defenses from hackers and how the companies safeguard any personal information such as location records collected from the vehicles they sell.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nUntil now, car hacking has remained a largely theoretical threat, despite some instances when thieves have disabled cars\u2019 door locks with wireless attacks or when a disgruntled dealership employee used a tool designed to enforce timely car payments to remotely brick more than one hundred vehicles.\n\nBut the security industry has demonstrated that vehicles\u2019 increasing connections to the internet create new avenues for attack. Earlier Tuesday morning, in fact, Wired revealed that two security researchers have developed and plan to partially release a new attack against hundreds of thousands of Chrysler vehicles that could allow hackers to gain access to their internal networks. As part of the same demo, those researchers, Charlie Miller and Chris Valasek, also demonstrated to Wired that they could use the attack to wirelessly control the steering, brakes, and transmission of a 2014 Jeep Cherokee over the Internet. (A Markey spokesperson insists that the bill\u2019s release wasn\u2019t timed to Wired\u2019s story.)\n\n\u201cDrivers shouldn\u2019t have to choose between being connected and being protected,\u201d Markey wrote in a statement shared with Wired. \u201cControlled demonstrations show how frightening it would be to have a hacker take over controls of a car. We need clear rules of the road that protect cars from hackers and American families from data trackers.\u201d\n\nMarkey and Blumenthal\u2019s bill will have three major points, according to a spokesperson\u2019s description. First, it will require the NHTSA and the FTC to set security standards for cars, including isolating critical software systems from the rest of a vehicle\u2019s internal network, penetration testing by security analysts, and the addition of on-board systems to detect and respond to malicious commands on the car\u2019s network. Second, it will ask those same agencies to set privacy standards, requiring carmakers to inform people of how they collect data from vehicles they sell, letting drivers opt out of that data collection and restricting how the information can be used for marketing. And finally, it will require manufacturers to display window stickers on new cars that rank their security and privacy protections.\n\nAutomakers have gotten hints for months that legislation was in the works. In February, Markey\u2019s office released the results of a series of questions it had sent to 20 carmakers, quizzing them on their handling of digital security and privacy. The 16 companies that responded gave answers that weren\u2019t reassuring. Nearly all of them said their vehicles now include wireless connections like cellular service, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi\u2013the means by which remote hacking can occur. Only seven said they used independent security testing to check their vehicles\u2019 security. Only two said they had tools in place to stop a hacker intrusion. And an \u201coverwhelming majority\u201d collected location information about their customers\u2019 vehicles, in many cases offering only ambiguous claims about encrypting the collected data.\n\nIn May, members of the House of Representatives\u2019 Energy and Commerce Committee followed up with their own set of even more detailed questions for 17 automakers and the National Highway Safety and Transportation Administration. \u201cWhile threats to vehicle technology currently appear isolated and disparate, as the technology becomes more prevalent, so too will the risks associated with it,\u201d read the letter.\n\nDespite that growing drum beat of warnings about digital attacks on cars, however, not everyone in the security community is so excited about legislation. Josh Corman, one of the co-founders of the security industry group I Am the Cavalry, which is focused on protecting things like medical devices and automobiles, was wary of a possible bill when he spoke with Wired about the possibility earlier this month.\n\nCorman worried that the ensuing law could be comparable to payment card industry rules that are widely seen as outmoded and ineffective. Instead, he said he hoped the auto industry could be nudged into innovating security features on its own in the same sort of competition that currently exists for traditional safety features.\n\n\u201cLaws are ill-suited for a dynamic space like this,\u201d Corman said at the time. \u201cIf this can catalyze [the industry] standing up straighter and getting a plan in place, that\u2019s great. If it makes them less responsive in the face of new adversaries, that could be very bad.\u201d\n\nWhether through legislation or industry competition, however, the pressure on carmakers to protect vehicles from hackers is growing. \u201cIf consumers don\u2019t realize this is an issue, they should, and they should start complaining to carmakers,\u201d says Miller. \u201cCars should be secure.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:06:11.731+0000"}

But in the decades since its founding in 1947, the nature of warfare has changed, as has the nature of photojournalism. The exhibition \u201cFailing Leviathan: Magnum Photographers and Civil War\u201d which is on display at the National Civil War Centre in the U.K. until Nov. 5, shows those dual evolutions through the work of 11 photographers in 11 conflicts.\n\nWhen Magnum co-founder Ropert Capa covered the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s, journalists were invited by the warring parties to cover the action, said Julian Stallabrass, who curated the exhibit. Major outside powers were often involved in the fighting and the conflicts had their origins in ideological differences. Photographers covered either one side or the other. Today, Stallabrass said, civil wars tend to be \u201cmessy long-term multisided resource battles\u201d between local forces.\n\nCopyright Werner Bischof/Magnum Photos\n\nCopyright Susan Meiselas/Magnum Photos\n\nPhotographers, meanwhile, now occupy more ambiguous roles in the conflicts. \u201cIt\u2019s not clear the photographers are not partisan supporters of any particular side,\u201d Stallabrass said. The sort of gaggle of international press photographers that Werner Bischof captured during the Korean War in 1952 is uncommon; today, countries don\u2019t invite journalists en masse to witness civil war. Moreover, far fewer publications send photographers to war zones; many photographers today work independently with no guarantee of being published and few personal protections. Magnum photographers are rare exceptions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\u201cThe illustrated magazines were once a huge commercial force and the successful photographers within them were given immense resources in terms of time and money. Obviously the media as we know it now is nothing like that. Major newspapers are in financial trouble and have increasingly abandoned reporting from war zones. There\u2019s an attraction to war photography, but at the same time it\u2019s difficult and expensive. The market for these things is no longer clear either. That\u2019s why they\u2019ve been turning to Instagram or self-publishing,\u201d Stallabrass said.\n\nLeft: David Seymour/Magnum Photos.

Still, Stallabrass said, Magnum photographers can tell stories in ways that amateurs can\u2019t, and their services therefore may be more essential than they\u2019ve ever been.\n\n\u201cIt's much easier than it used to be to take decent images, photos that are in focus and properly exposed even in tricky positions. But photographers can build a narrative into a picture to show what's going on, to show competing or contradictory images within a single frame or across a series of pictures. That's a real skill and it takes many years to develop it. That's what amateurs lack.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:06:18.967+0000"}

John Kasich is expected to draw a crowd of thousands when he declares his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination in Columbus today.

As Trump's 20-point swing shows, polls can shift in a hurry, and the lower tier of candidates has a lot of potential for movement.

{"entityId": 426, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nI thought I was done covering the McCain campaign, but Donald Trump has revived some recollections of McCain\u2019s battles for the presidency in 2000 and 2008.\n\nDonald Trump said over the weekend about John McCain: \u201cHe\u2019s not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren\u2019t captured.\u201d McCain, who spent five years as a POW, would agree. When he was a presidential candidate and the local official introducing him went on about McCain\u2019s heroism\u2014the refusal of early release, the broken bones, the defiance of his captors\u2014McCain would say that he was no hero, but he served in the company of heroes. McCain also used to boast at almost every stop about how he finished near the bottom of his class at the Naval Academy. (But when Trump pointed this out, Trump says, McCain supposedly was furious about it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs a candidate, McCain regularly chronicled his imperfections both on the record and off. Some of this was false modesty\u2014which McCain would admit\u2014but at least McCain was acquainted with the idea of modesty and how it relates to the presidency. There are many reasons why Donald Trump is not likely to put his name on 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Among them is that, in an office where modesty was once the central virtue, he would be the first elected president who never makes public displays of it.\n\nIn many ways, presidential candidates live a life that Donald Trump has already lived as a civilian.\n\nThe swipe at John McCain was efficient. It insulted McCain\u2019s service and denigrated the service of every POW who happened to get captured. It invited brutal investigations into Trump\u2019s lack of service to his country. And it showcased a brilliant facet of Donald Trump\u2019s ego\u2014one of many that have shined brightly since he became the first candidate to join a presidential campaign by escalator.\n\nTrump lashed out because he was irritated at McCain and peeved at interviewer Frank Luntz for interrupting him. Called on it afterward, he tried to turn the moment into a debate about McCain\u2019s treatment of veterans. On the Dana Loesch radio show on Monday Trump proclaimed, \u201cNobody has done more for the vets than I have\u201d\u2014which, according to Trump, means serving as co-chairman of the New York Vietnam Veterans Memorial Commission, contributing over $1 million, and financing and serving as the grand marshal of the 1995 Nation\u2019s Day Parade.\n\nIt\u2019s likely that a few more people have done more for the vets, but this is a familiar retort from the candidate whose usual response to controversy is to reflect on his own personal greatness. Upon concluding the interview Trump boasted to Luntz: \u201cI get standing ovations, the other candidates don\u2019t.\u201d In future press appearances, Trump has insisted he won \u201cthe biggest standing ovation\u201d of the day, and his press release continued this point: \u201cMr. Trump left to a long lasting standing ovation, which will be by far the biggest ovation of the weekend, and much congratulatory praise.\u201d\n\nThat isn\u2019t so, says pollster Luntz, who says other candidates received bigger ovations. (Video evidence supports Luntz\u2019s account.) This would seem an insignificant point, but no measure is too small when it comes to heralding the greatness that is Donald Trump. When Trump filed his financial disclosure forms with the Federal Elections Commission last week, the first line issued an advisory: \u201cThis report was not designed for a man of Mr. Trump\u2019s massive wealth.\u201d It then printed his purported net worth in all-caps: \u201cTEN BILLION DOLLARS.\u201d\n\nThis attention to the self would shock the founders and the first dozen or so American presidents. They never campaigned for the office of the presidency. To pursue the office meant you cared more about yourself and your ambition than the people. Modesty was the key sign of virtue for a president. \u201cPopular campaigning was not only dangerous,\u201d writes Gil Troy in See How They Ran, \u201cit was improper, illegitimate, and unnecessary. Candidates \u2026 simply had to allow those who knew them to recognize their virtue.\u201d\n\nThat has changed, obviously. In many ways, modern presidential candidates live a life that Donald Trump has already lived as a civilian. They spend their time in places where their names are plastered on all available surfaces. They speak in the first person and boast about their achievements. They spend time in the company of the vastly wealthy.\n\nBut that\u2019s where the similarities end. The traditional candidate puts him- or herself forward in order to promote a program of ideas. For Donald Trump, he is the program. As Hank Sheinkopf said in the New York Times Monday: \u201cHis real business is giving out his name as a franchise \u2026 His business is being Donald Trump.\u201d Or, as the Wall Street Journal put it, \u201cHis only discernible principle is the promotion of his personal brand.\u201d\n\nThe reason the founders cared so much about modesty, and the reason we expect a sliver of it today in candidates, is that presidents have enormous power. When they are alone with that power, we hope they exercise it in the service of the nation and not in their personal ambitions, grudges, or flights of fancy. The founders also recognized that only ambitious men would rise through the political ranks, so a president needed some internal governor in addition to the structural ones the founders created through the separation of powers.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty-six years ago, George Washington didn\u2019t want to be president but took the job because he cared more about his country than himself. That\u2019s a different way to get your name on a slab of granite.\n\n", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:06:50.991+0000"}

But her most visible primary opponents\u2014Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley\u2014made a trek to the conference. Again, the politicians in attendance stumbled and, in the process, brought the intraleft divide to the center of attention. Ironically, the struggles of O\u2019Malley and Sanders offer an opening for Clinton on vital issues within the Democratic coalition.\n\nThis year\u2019s disruption came from Black Lives Matter, the anti-racist movement sparked in the aftermath of Ferguson and fueled by the steady drip of police violence against black Americans. Midway through O\u2019Malley\u2019s remarks, demonstrators marched toward the stage, chanting names of black women killed by the police or who died in police custody.\n\nAfter a few minutes of protest, organizers handed protesters microphones, and they used the opportunity to question and challenge O\u2019Malley on police brutality. O\u2019Malley, notes BuzzFeed\u2019s Ruby Cramer, was supportive, nodding his head in assent to the questions and concerns.\n\nHe erred, however, when protesters shouted their slogan, \u201cBlack lives matter!\u201d O\u2019Malley responded, \u201cBlack lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\u201d The demonstrators booed. The reason is easy to understand. \u201cBlack lives matter\u201d is a statement of specific concern; police violence is most acute against black Americans, and so activists stress the importance of their lives. To reply with \u201call lives matter\u201d is to suggest there\u2019s no specific problem of police abuse targeted at black Americans. It\u2019s as if someone responded to an annual breast cancer drive with \u201cBreast cancer matters. Prostate cancer matters. All cancer matters.\u201d It sounds like a dismissal, and that\u2019s how it was received.\n\nIf this was a miscue, then the confrontation with Sanders was a fiasco. Whereas O\u2019Malley adjusted to protesters, Sanders tried to barrel through them. \u201cWhoa, whoa, let me talk about what I came to talk about for a minute,\u201d he said. Speaking over shouts of \u201csay her name\u201d and \u201cblack lives matter,\u201d Sanders tried to establish his civil rights bona fides. \u201cBlack lives, of course, matter. I spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if you don\u2019t want me to be here, that\u2019s OK. I don\u2019t want to outscream people.\u201d Even if that response was understandable, Sanders only made things worse. When he tried to cite Obamacare as something he\u2019s done for people of color, protesters responded with jeers. One woman said, \u201cWe can\u2019t afford that!\u201d When he talked up free college and opportunity for black Americans, a heckler yelled \u201cPublic college won\u2019t stop police from killing us!\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:07:10.220+0000"}

And he was totally right! On Sunday, KrebsonSecurity reported news of an extensive breach.\n\nLily Hay Newman Lily Hay Newman is a staff writer and the lead blogger for Future Tense.\n\n\n\nWith a slogan like \u201cLife Is Short. Have an Affair\u201d and 37 million users, you can see why Ashley Madison's data might be tempting for hackers looking to wreak some havoc. The culprits are calling themselves \u201cthe Impact Team\u201d and say that if Avid Life Media, which owns Ashley Madison, doesn't take the site down, they'll leak all of the data they collected on the service's servers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut this isn't (just) about a moral objection to cheating. The Impact Team hackers assert that Ashley Madison's \u201cFull Delete\u201d feature, which claims to remove all identifying data from company servers for $19, doesn't actually work. Krebs reports that the Impact Team wrote in a manifesto, \u201cFull Delete netted ALM $1.7mm in revenue in 2014. It\u2019s also a complete lie. Users almost always pay with credit card; their purchase details are not removed as promised, and include real name and address, which is of course the most important information the users want removed.\u201d\n\nNot that the hackers are exactly on the side of Ashley Madison's users. \u201cToo bad for those men, they\u2019re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion,\u201d the group wrote. There's some irony in outing the injured parties whom you're simultaneously trying to defend, but the hackers seem more interested in making a general point about services that claim to erase user data.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, Avid Life Media said:\n\nWe apologize for this unprovoked and criminal intrusion into our customers\u2019 information. ... We have always had the confidentiality of our customers\u2019 information foremost in our minds, and have had stringent security measures in place ... At this time, we have been able to secure our sites, and close the unauthorized access points. We are working with law enforcement agencies, which are investigating this criminal act. Any and all parties responsible for this act of cyber\u2013terrorism will be held responsible.\n\n\n\nAshley Madison's data is even more valuable than what comes out of the usual hack because it's identity theft fodder plus information about who has cheated or considered cheating on a partner and what people's sexual preferences/fantasies are. But the site's privacy setup wasn't exactly stellar before. As developer Troy Hunt showed on his blog, the forgot password feature of Ashley Madison returned a slightly different screen depending on whether an email address was registered with the site. If you wanted to check whether your spouse was on the site, you just had to enter some of his or her addresses.\n\nOf course, if Ashley Madison's users were smart enough to make special dummy email addresses for digital indiscretions, you wouldn't be able to catch them this way, but it's still a big privacy hole, and let's be honest, most people aren't that wily. Hunt told Motherboard that the password reset mistake is a privacy oversight on a lot of sites. \u201cUnfortunately it's all too common. ... I would have been surprised if they'd done it right.

Given current geopolitical tensions, the fact that the U.S. got Russia to agree to the deal is almost as remarkable as Iran signing on.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nThis morning the deal was endorsed by the U.N. Security Council, including Russia. In 90 days, unless Republicans in the U.S. Congress manage to torpedo the entire process, which is highly unlikely, the U.S., EU, and U.N. will begin preparations to lift sanctions once Iran is found to be in compliance. The deal includes a so-called snapback provision, which allows sanctions to be easily reimposed if Iran is believed to be in violation of its commitments under the agreement. Under this provision, any of the six powers that negotiated the deal can submit a complaint to a dispute resolution panel. If those concerns aren\u2019t resolved, sanctions will automatically go back into effect in 30 days without another vote from the Security Council. This unusual feature is designed so that Iran\u2019s allies on the Security Council\u2014Russia and China\u2014can\u2019t use their veto to keep sanctions from being reimposed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThis is a pretty big concession for Russia, for which the Security Council veto is an important confirmation of superpower status. There had been speculation in the weeks leading up to the final deal that Russian reluctance to give up the veto might derail the whole thing.\n\nChina, which is already Iran\u2019s largest trading partner and has ambitions to build a major overland trade system through Central Asia, has clear economic interests in seeing sanctions on Iran lifted. But for Russia it\u2019s not so simple. The Russian economy has already been devastated by the combined effects of its own economic sanctions and low global oil and gas prices. The lifting of sanctions on Iran will likely cause those prices to drop even further as Iranian energy exports return to the global market.\n\nIran is also a customer for Russia\u2019s second-most-famous export\u2014weapons. Putin agreed in April to lift a self-imposed ban on selling air defense systems to Iran, prompting protests from the U.S. and Israel. A lessening of tensions between the West and Iran, and a lower likelihood of airstrikes on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, could mean that Iran has less interest in buying systems to prevent such an attack.\n\nStill, as Newsweek\u2019s Owen Matthews suggests, Putin\u2019s support for the separatist rebels in Ukraine shows he\u2019s willing to put what he perceives as his country\u2019s geopolitical best interests over narrow economic concerns, and the Iran deal could be another example of this. Russia sees its Iranian ally\u2019s growing regional clout as a challenge to U.S. and Saudi dominance of the Middle East\u2014particularly in Syria, where Moscow and Tehran are the leading remaining backers of internationally isolated President Bashar al-Assad.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:07:27.271+0000"}

{"entityId": 435, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s insult of John McCain\u2019s war record on Saturday has led to nearly universal condemnation from his Republican primary adversaries. More importantly, it might also be the well-anticipated moment when Trump\u2019s popularity in the GOP race comes crashing down. Whatever happens next in the campaign, though, it\u2019s fair to say that the damage to Trump\u2019s national personal standing and miniature media empire has already been done. That happened the instant he entered the race by attacking Mexican immigrants as \u201ccriminals\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d and it happened thanks largely to an unprecedented grassroots response by Latino-Americans, Latino immigrants, and the broader Latino world. Whether or not Trump\u2019s poll numbers return to earth because of the McCain flap, Trump\u2019s entertainment properties don\u2019t ever seem likely to recover from the damage caused by the united Latino response to his blatant xenophobia.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks weren\u2019t the first time Trump or a high-profile politician had made racist comments about Latinos. Trump himself has blamed crime on blacks and Hispanics before. But this time Latinos were quicker to unite and more effective to protest than ever before. Trump\u2019s outsized personality probably had something to do with the passion of the response. But this became a watershed moment for the Hispanic community mostly because of how the outrage was manifested through social media, and how Hispanic mainstream media reacted to this discontent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn Latin America, politicians and celebrities channeled Hispanics\u2019 collective indignation. Mexican ex-presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon called him an \u201cidiot\u201d and a \u201chypocrite,\u201d while the Mexican congress declared Trump persona non grata. Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro said Trump was a \u201cbandit and a thief,\u201d and that \"whoever messes with Mexico, messes with Venezuela.\" Televisa, the largest Spanish-language network in the world, cut all ties with Trump, and Colombia, Costa Rica, Panama, and Mexico said they were not sending candidates to Trump\u2019s Miss Universe pageant. Mexican celebrities like Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal called him an \u201cimbecile\u201d and others like Puerto Rico\u2019s Ricky Martin, Cuban-American Pitbull, Spain\u2019s Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, and Colombia\u2019s Shakira and Paulina Vega\u2014the reigning Miss Universe\u2014denounced his statements.\n\n\u201cWhen you attack one of us, you attack all of us,\u201d journalist Jorge Ramos said during an award ceremony last week. \u201cAnd on Election Day, we will remember.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Latinos of all nationalities voiced their collective indignation on social media. Jokes and memes quickly proliferated pointing out the abundant hypocrisies in Trump\u2019s comments, like the fact that Trump brand suits have been made in Mexico and his hotels rely on the labor of undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut the most effective reactions were the most personal. Adriana Almanza, a Mexican-American woman from Michigan, wrote a Facebook post in response to Trump that has garnered more than 330,000 likes and 145,000 shares. In it she described her father, who arrived illegally to the United States 30 years ago, as a true face of Mexican immigration.\n\n\u201cIf my dad is any representation of the type of people Mexico \u2018sends\u2019, there is no doubt in my mind this country is getting the best,\u201d Almanza wrote. \u201cThe best, to me, are those that work hard and still remain humble. That is exactly what my father embodies; that is exactly what the other millions of Mexicans embody.\u201d\n\nPerhaps even more popular was a video of a construction worker offering a barbed response to Trump in Spanish, all while continuing to work in 107-degree heat. \u201cLook, asshole, this is my drug\u201d he says, raising a mallet in one hand, \u201cand this is my booze,\u201d showing a hammer in the other. The YouTube clip has more than half a million views.\n\nHispanic media was paying attention, particularly Univision. After seeing the reaction from the Hispanic community, Univision cut ties with Trump, announcing it would no longer broadcast his Miss USA pageant. NBC soon joined Univision in ending its relationship with Trump, as did Macy\u2019s, ESPN, the PGA, and NASCAR, to name a few.\n\nThe fact that Univision\u2019s response was so in line with other major corporate brands was in and of itself a statement. Certainly, by treating the issue with the seriousness it deserved, Univision showed its audience that it respected them and that their voices mattered. But major companies also responded to Univision\u2019s move not as a niche choice made by a niche network, but as a savvy business decision by an American ratings giant, a decision that ought to be emulated.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:07:53.237+0000"}

The spat began when McCain, a long-time advocate of immigration reform, took issue with the real estate mogul\u2019s remarks branding many Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers. Trump then fired back during a rally in McCain\u2019s home state of Arizona last weekend, calling the Republican senator \u201cweak on immigration\u201d and an \u201cincompetent\u201d politician, and suggesting that a more conservative candidate could defeat McCain during his Republican Senate primary next year. McCain, in turn, returned fire in an interview with the New Yorker on Thursday. \u201cThis performance with our friend out in Phoenix is very hurtful to me,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cBecause what we did was he fired up the crazies.\u201d\n\nSeveral of Trump\u2019s rivals in the GOP\u2019s crowded presidential field wasted no time rushing to McCain\u2019s defense on Saturday, including Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal, and Rick Santorum, who tweeted: \u201c[John McCain] is an American hero, period.\u201d Perry went even further, calling for Trump to drop out as a result. \u201cHis comments have reached a new low in American politics,\u201d the former Texas governor said in a written statement. \u201cHis attack on veterans make him unfit to be Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. armed forces, and he should immediately withdraw from the race for President.\u201d\n\nTrump, of course, is no stranger to inflammatory rhetoric and hasn\u2019t hesitated to attack his fellow Republicans, including Jeb Bush, the establishment favorite who has seen Trump pull even or surpass him in recent national polls. Still, Trump\u2019s latest swing at McCain is a good deal bigger than the ones he\u2019s taken at Bush about his negotiating skills, and touches on a group of Americans\u2014veterans\u2014that tend to be off-limits from political criticism. As a result, his jab at McCain provides an opening for Trump's rivals to criticize him without having to navigate more fraught territory like immigration reform.\n\nAt least one conservative observer was already predicting that Trump\u2019s attack on McCain could derail a campaign that has so far only gotten stronger under the spotlight. \u201cAdvice to [Trump]: Apologize for this pronto,\u201d Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol tweeted. \u201cOtherwise beginning of the end.\u201d Whether that proves true, of course, remains to be seen. To date, Trump\u2019s failure to play by the traditional rules of politics doesn\u2019t seem to have hurt him one bit.\n\nWith the crowd in Ames on Saturday morning, at least, Trump\u2019s brand seemed largely untarnished. After providing rambling answers to a few more questions from the moderator and the crowd\u2014and at one point responding to a question about his Christian faith by mentioning the GDP and his MBA\u2014Trump left to a standing ovation.\n\nUpdate 2:42 p.m.: Trump is already scrambling to clean up his mess without backing off his attacks on McCain. Shortly after leaving the summit, he posted a message to his Facebook account that explained that he is \u201cnot a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our Veterans,\u201d and because\u201c\"he was extremely disrespectful\u201d to those Arizona voters he labeled \u201ccrazies.\u201d In closing, Trump praised American troops. \u201cI have great respect for all those who serve in our military including those that weren\u2019t captured and are also heroes,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI want to strengthen our military and take care of our Veterans. I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN especially for those that serve to protect our freedom. I am fighting for our Veterans!\u201d\n\nElsewhere in Slate: The Case for Covering Trump: Why the media shouldn\u2019t ignore his doomed campaign.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:08:12.230+0000"}

The U.S. attorney says investigators are treating the attacks, committed by a lone gunman at a military recruiting station and a Navy and Marine Corps Reserve center, as a possible \u201cact of terrorism.\u201d Defense Secretary Ashton Carter calls it a \u201csenseless act of violence.\u201d Navy Secretary Ray Mabus says the attacks were out of bounds: \u201cWhile we expect our Sailors and Marines to go into harm's way, and they do so without hesitation, an attack at home, in our community, is insidious and unfathomable.\u201d\n\nWilliam Saletan Will Saletan writes about politics, science, technology, and other stuff for Slate. He\u2019s the author of Bearing Right.\n\n\n\nSenseless? Unfathomable? Terrorism? I doubt it. If this incident was inspired by Islamic jihad, as many investigators suspect, then it probably wasn\u2019t senseless. Nor was it terrorism. It was a rational, horrific act of war.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAmericans think we\u2019re tough because we have a strong military. In truth, most of us are soft. We know nothing of combat. We don\u2019t regularly hear gunfire or worry about our kids dying in an airstrike. When somebody who\u2019s angry at our government opens fire in one of our cities, we can\u2019t believe crime has come to our own neighborhood. We call it terrorism.\n\nBut not every act of political violence is terrorism. Terrorism has a specific legal meaning. Some definitions, such as the one in Title 18, Section 2331 of the U.S. Code (dangerous crimes intended \u201cto influence the policy of a government\u201d), are so absurdly broad that they could cover almost any politically motivated crime. The tightest and best definition is the one in Title 22, Section 2656 of the U.S. Code: \u201cpremeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets.\u201d That\u2019s the definition our government applies when documenting terrorism overseas.\n\nThe typical noncombatant target is an innocent civilian. That\u2019s what makes Sept. 11 and the ISIS hostage beheadings clear acts of terrorism. By this standard, Chattanooga wasn\u2019t terrorism, because the victims weren\u2019t civilians. All four were Marines. Three had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.\n\nMabus, the Navy secretary, is outraged that these men were killed stateside. They were at a training facility, not in a war zone. And the Army office shot up a few minutes earlier by the same gunman, Mohammad Youssuf Abdulazeez, was just a recruiting center. The State Department\u2019s definition of terrorism takes this context into account. It stipulates: \u201cThe term \u2018non-combatant\u2019 \u2026 is interpreted to mean, in addition to civilians, military personnel (whether or not armed or on duty) who are not deployed in a war zone or a war-like setting.\u201d\n\nIf they\u2019re going to come after us, it\u2019s better that they target our service members than our schools and buses.\n\nBut what, exactly, is a war zone? Today, with the aid of remotely piloted vehicles, you can engage in combat overseas without leaving the safety of your own country. That\u2019s what many of our fighters are doing. Last month in the Daily Beast, David Axe reported that according to U.S. military officials, during the past year, drones have conducted nearly 900 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria\u2014and even when they\u2019re not firing the missiles, they\u2019re \u201cinvolved in pretty much every engagement.\u201d The drones are being piloted from Creech Air Force Base in Nevada, with help from other stateside bases. If you want to kill the people who are firing those missiles in Iraq, you have to come here.\n\nAre trainers and recruiters noncombatants? If so, we\u2019re killing noncombatants every week. According to the Pentagon\u2019s latest published data, our coalition in Syria and Iraq has struck more than 2,000 enemy \u201cbuildings\u201d and nearly 500 \u201cstaging areas.\u201d A \u201cstaging area\u201d can be almost anything\u2014according to the U.S. military glossary, it\u2019s \u201ca general locality established for the concentration of troop units.\u201d Scan the Pentagon\u2019s daily reports on the campaign, and you\u2019ll see accounts of strikes against \u201cbarracks,\u201d \u201ccompounds,\u201d \u201cstructures,\u201d \u201cmanufacturing workshops,\u201d and \u201clogistics hubs.\u201d If you\u2019re an ISIS foot soldier, it hardly matters where you are or what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re a target.\n\nRecruiters are standard fare. In February, we sent a drone to kill an ISIS recruiter in Afghanistan, even though, according to a Pentagon spokesman, the recruiter had \u201cdecided to swear allegiance to [ISIS] probably no more than a couple weeks ago. And he didn't have a whole lot of depth to any network resources or manpower when he did it.\u201d\n\nWhen we target a training facility and kill its inhabitants, we don\u2019t call that terrorism. We call it moral success. Last fall, at a poststrike briefing, the Pentagon\u2019s spokesman showed reporters a video of a \u201cresidence\u201d on the Iraq-Syria border:\n\nThis was a residential area that had been used for a training site and for a logistics site for [ISIS] fighters. It was engaged with multiple GPS-guided missiles. \u2026 And, as you can see, the aircraft targeted locations within the boundaries, within the fence line of the residence. \u2026 It was through the careful planning and coordination of U.S. Central Command's combined air operations center, located in the region, that these strikes were successful with minimal collateral damage.\n\nThat\u2019s how we evaluate our own strikes overseas: If we target a training site, and if the only people we kill are the fighters or trainees inside, our hands are clean. And that seems to be what Abdulazeez did to our own men in Chattanooga. We don\u2019t yet know his motive. But if it turns out that he was angry about U.S. military action abroad\u2014and if his response was to kill U.S. military personnel\u2014does that make him a terrorist? Or just an enemy combatant?\n\nChattanooga wasn\u2019t the first attack on a military facility in the United States, and it won\u2019t be the last. We\u2019ve been hit before, in Little Rock, Arkansas, and in Fort Hood, Texas. According to the New America Foundation, 1 of every 3 Americans who have been accused of planning domestic attacks since Sept. 11\u2014that\u2019s nearly 40 people, out of 119\u2014targeted military sites.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:08:31.907+0000"}

Photos by David Becker/Getty Images, Christopher Gregory/Getty Images.\n\nFirst things first: Donald Trump is a vitriol-spewing, media-manipulating, self-aggrandizing, bigoted publicity hound who has no realistic chance of winning the Republican nomination next summer or any other. While a growing number of national polls currently have the once-and-future reality television star atop a historically crowded GOP field, Trump\u2019s candidacy is destined to fade away just as countless other novelty candidates have in primaries past.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nNone of that, however, is any reason for the media not to seriously cover Trump\u2019s campaign today. The Donald may be a Twitter troll in a $5,000 Brioni suit, but he\u2019s also the avatar of choice for a significant subset of the American electorate who sees themselves in his particular brand of belligerence. That view and those voters won\u2019t disappear when Trump does. The press ignores that fact at its own peril\u2014and at the public\u2019s own loss.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nOn Friday, the Huffington Post announced that from this point forth it will relegate its coverage of all things Trump to its entertainment section. \u201cOur reason is simple: Trump\u2019s campaign is a sideshow. We won\u2019t take the bait,\u201d editorial director Danny Shea and Washington bureau chief Ryan Grim wrote in a note to readers of one of the largest news outlets in the nation. \u201cIf you are interested in what The Donald has to say, you\u2019ll find it next to our stories on the Kardashians and The Bachelorette.\u201d\n\nThe Huffington Post so far stands alone in officially declaring itself above Trump as a news story, but it\u2019s clear there are plenty of working journalists who would be happy if their bosses made a similar decision. Politico\u2019s Ben White, to pick but one example, made his feelings known Thursday. \u201cTrump\u2019s time in the lead will fade as the debates begin and the Republican Party starts to get serious,\u201d White argued. \u201cAnd then all this coverage of the big-mouth billionaire will be exposed as largely ridiculous.\u201d (As someone who is paid to write about the campaign every day, I\u2019ve been guilty of my own type of Trump dismissal; I began much of my early coverage of Trump\u2019s campaign with the word Ugh, a knowing wink meant to make it clear that I, too, would prefer to be writing about more traditional candidates.)\n\nSuch arguments against spilling digital ink on Trump are built on the idea that he can\u2019t win the nomination. That premise is correct, but the conclusion that follows\u2014The media shouldn\u2019t waste its resources covering him\u2014is false. For evidence, we have to look no further than those very same candidates that Trump dismissers rightly point to as proof that his time leading the GOP field will be short lived: Herman Cain and Sarah Palin.\n\nBoth Cain and Palin spent time at or near the top of national polls four years ago but flamed out soon after. Does the fact that the pair ended up with zero primary or caucus victories between them mean the media should have ignored them from the get-go? Hardly. Their rise was an important story line in the 2012 election. They provided clear evidence of conservative skepticism of Mitt Romney, while also reminding the GOP establishment that primary voters crave simplicity in message. For Cain, reforming the U.S. tax code was as simple as \u201c9-9-9\u201d; for Palin, addressing the nation\u2019s energy needs was as simple as \u201cDrill, baby, drill.\u201d Four years later, Trump has surged past the establishment favorites by adding his own simplistic policy plank to the conservative platform: the promise of solving our immigration problems by building a fence along the Mexican border that we won\u2019t even have to pay for.\n\nCain, meanwhile, is a particularly helpful example of why these flash-in-the-pan candidates require immediate coverage. It was the increased scrutiny that the press provided that ultimately spelled his downfall. (The same could be said for Palin\u2019s disastrous vice presidential run in 2008.) Without that all-in coverage, voters would have never known that Cain was unable to answer basic foreign policy questions or that he faced a series of troubling sexual harassment allegations. It was only by treating the former Godfather\u2019s Pizza CEO as a legitimate candidate that the press was able to prove that he wasn\u2019t one.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:08:34.050+0000"}

The New York Times reports today on a hastily thrown-together press conference of conservative analysts who\u2019ve gone through the text of the agreement to find places where it supposedly crosses previously established \u201cred lines.\u201d And the previously highly critical hardliner newspaper Kayhan has offered some mild criticism. But with the supreme leader giving his tepid endorsement to the work of President Hassan Rouhani and his negotiators, not to mention strong public support for a deal to bring sanctions relief, it\u2019s hard to imagine this grumbling having much effect.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nOne reason for the muted response? Iranian political analyst Saeed Leilaz suggests to the AP that \u201cIran\u2019s hard-liners don\u2019t want to be seen as [an] ally of [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu these days.\u201d As one Tehran resident quoted by the AP puts it, \u201cThere are three groups of people in the world who are against the deal: War-mongering Republicans in the U.S., Netanyahu and hard-liners in Iran.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nProponents of the deal were playing up Netanyahu\u2019s opposition even before it was signed, with former President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani, an ally of Rouhani, saying that hardliners \u201cspeak Netanyahu\u2019s language.\u201d When the framework agreement was signed back in April, supporters in the streets of Tehran chanted \u201cKayhan, Israel, our condolences,\u201d putting the conservative paper and Iran\u2019s arch-enemy in the same category.\n\nEven in the U.S., Netanyahu\u2019s vociferous opposition may have helped smooth the deal\u2019s path. The prime minister\u2019s speech to Congress in April at the invitation of Republican leaders appalled many Democrats and likely led at least some to overcome their normal resistance to supporting something strongly opposed by the Israeli government. For instance, after signing on to a pledge last January not to support new sanctions on Iran while negotiators were still working out the framework agreement Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat and frequent critic of the White House who had previously supported new sanctions, said that the invitation had shifted the dynamic and that \u201cFor the prime minister to accept made it extremely political.\u201d\n\nRepublicans will probably need 13 Democrats from the Senate and 43 from the House to break ranks and oppose the deal in order to override Obama\u2019s veto. It\u2019s hard to imagine that what was seen as a blatantly partisan gesture by Netanyahu, the deal\u2019s foremost international opponent, makes that more likely.\n\nYou would think that this would be a major setback for the Israeli prime minister, but as the Times\u2019 Jodi Rudoren notes today, it could actually work in his favor. Netanyahu\u2019s conservative base will credit him for standing up to the United States to oppose the deal, and some of his moderate opponents, who also oppose it, may even use it as a pretext to join his government\u2014shoring up his narrow and fragile coalition. The Obama administration may also now be less likely to put pressure on him on issues in the West Bank and Gaza for fear of being seen as piling on.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:09:20.219+0000"}

He lives in Iowa City.\n\nSpeaking at a town hall\u2013style campaign event in New Hampshire on Thursday, Clinton failed to win over a group of climate-conscious voters in the crowd, and eventually, had to stand around awkwardly as several attendees serenaded her with a chant of, \u201cAct on climate.\u201d*\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe trouble for Clinton started during a question-and-answer segment, when she was asked a yes-or-no question about whether she would ban the extraction of fossil fuels from public grounds. \u201cThe answer is no until we get alternatives in place,\u201d Clinton answered. That response, in turn, prompted an aggressive follow-up from a second person in the crowd: \u201cIs your refusal to take leadership on climate change due to the fact that you have contributions from the fossil fuel industry in your campaign?\u201d\n\nClinton, who has spent the bulk of her campaign events fielding questions from pre-screened voters, appeared to get caught flat-footed. \u201cNo, no it is not,\u201d she replied before launching into an inelegant response that suggested it was na\u00efve to call for an end to drilling without a comprehensive energy plan that \u201cdoesn\u2019t disrupt our economy.\u201d Before Clinton was completely done talking, a third attendee stood up and, after shouting something inaudible, began the climate chant.\n\nAs the video illustrates, Clinton has her work cut out for her if she wants to win over climate hawks who have long been skeptical of her environmental bona fides. To date, her climate pitch has basically amounted to a promise to continue President Obama\u2019s climate agenda. But while the climate crowd has applauded the president\u2019s carbon rules that look to curb fossil fuel demand, they\u2019ve been less than pleased with his decision to expand supply by giving the federal greenlight to energy companies to mine for coal and drill for oil on public lands.\n\nAs I explained Wednesday, though, the unfortunate reality for climate activists is that Hillary doesn\u2019t need to be overly concerned about them in the primary, since she doesn\u2019t have to worry about them in the general election.

{"entityId": 451, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s criminal justice reform week at the Obama White House. On Tuesday, the president gave a major speech outlining the moral and economic case for shrinking the prison population, rehabilitating inmates instead of merely locking them up, and\n\nLeon Neyfakh Leon Neyfakh is a Slate staff writer.\n\naddressing the disproportionate impact of policing and criminal prosecution on poor black communities. Earlier in the week, Obama ordered 46 nonviolent drug offenders to be freed from federal prison, saying that the long sentences they were given at the height of the war on drugs did not fit their crimes. On Thursday, Obama will become the first sitting president to visit a federal prison, when he makes a trip to Oklahoma to meet with inmates and talk about the squalid conditions in which they live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has been holding hearings on criminal justice reform, with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hosting a parade of legislators\u2014including Senate Democrat Cory Booker and House Republican Jim Sensenbrenner\u2014who have put forth bills of varying ambition that would change the way the federal government punishes large categories of offenders. Predictions that Congress will pass some kind of legislation before the end of the current session are growing louder and more assured.\n\nTaken together, it looks like momentum. And it undoubtedly is. But the political progress belies a troubling, substantive fact: The federal prison system, which is what all these national lawmakers are talking about when they talk about reform, is relatively small, and fixing it would not have any direct effect on the state and local systems in which the vast majority of American inmates are incarcerated. As Obama underscored in yesterday\u2019s speech, there are more than 2.2 million people currently behind bars in the United States, including about 700,000 in local jails. According to the latest numbers from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, just 215,866 of them are serving in federal prison.\n\n\u201cIf you were to release every federal prisoner today, that still would leave about 1.3 million people in prison.\u201d\n\n\n\nObviously, that\u2019s a lot of people whose lives stand to improve if the reform efforts in Washington succeed. But it would be a mistake to interpret the passage of even the most far-reaching federal legislation currently on the table\u2014that would be Sensenbrenner and Virginia Congressman Bobby Scott\u2019s SAFE Justice Act, introduced in June\u2014as a decisive victory in the effort to end mass incarceration.\n\n\u201cIf you were to release every federal prisoner today, that still would leave about 1.3 million people in prison,\u201d said John Pfaff, a professor at Fordham University School of Law and a skeptic of mainstream reform efforts. \u201cWe\u2019d still have the highest number of people in prison in the world, and we\u2019d still have the highest incarceration rate.\u201d\n\nMaking more than a dent in those numbers will require the continued enthusiasm of the states, which have so far been leading the way on justice reform: in 2014 alone, 16 states passed legislation addressing sentencing policy, three states revised probation and parole policies, and 14 states took steps to reduce the collateral consequences associated with incarceration. Despite these efforts, the overall state prison population has gone down only slightly since peaking at 1.4 million in 2009. (In 2013, the state prison population actually went up by 4,300.) Cities and counties, meanwhile, incarcerate three times as many people in local jails today as they did in 1980.\n\nSo what is the federal government\u2019s role in ending mass incarceration, exactly, given that it only has jurisdiction over about 10 percent of the nation\u2019s prisoners? To find out, I called a number of experts and asked them whether all the excitement we\u2019re seeing around reform at the national level is warranted. They told me that while it\u2019s true federal legislation would only directly affect a relatively small number of prisoners, there is nevertheless significant value, both real and symbolic, in Congress and the president joining forces on this issue.\n\n\u201cWhat happens in Washington further catalyzes state action, and sort of reifies the commitment for reform on the state level,\u201d said Nicholas Turner, president of the Vera Institute of Justice. \u201cIt makes it safe for states that haven\u2019t yet engaged in reform to go in the water, and for states that have to do even more.\u201d He added, \u201cIt sends a signal that this is a national movement, and I think that gives cover to state actors who will venture further than they otherwise would.\u201d\n\nBut the federal government\u2019s more tangible power to influence state-level policy is through funding: Just as the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act created financial incentives for states to adopt harsh \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d laws that would keep criminals locked up longer, so could a reform effort in 2015 theoretically make it advantageous for states to take more of a \u201csmart on crime\u201d approach\u2014for instance, by providing federal funding to states that ease their mandatory minimum laws, or pass legislation that would divert drug offenders into treatment programs.\n\nAccording to the people I spoke to, none of the bills working their way through Washington at the moment include funding provisions comparable to the \u201ctruth in sentencing\u201d incentives that were baked into the 1994 law. But the federal government can and does use money as a carrot on this issue through non-legislative means: The Justice Department, for instance, provides grants to states that adopt policies that the Obama administration supports, through programs like the Justice Reinvestment Initiative.\n\n\u201cOver the years the Department of Justice has given literally billions of dollars to the states; all 50 states take money to help fund their criminal justice system every single year,\u201d said Joseph Margulies, a professor at Cornell Law School. \u201cThere could be different conditions placed on that money. \u2026 That\u2019s the 800-pound gorilla. It has the potential to dwarf the sentencing reforms that have gone on at the state level.\u201d\n\nThere is one possible downside to the criminal justice reform ideas being discussed at the federal level, and it has to do with the lowering of expectations. All the legislation on the table right now in Washington is designed to benefit so-called nonviolent offenders\u2014mainly people who have been arrested on drug crimes. There are many of those people in the federal prison system: According to statistics for 2013, just over half of federal prisoners are serving time for drug crimes.\n\nThe picture is very different in state prisons, in which 54 percent of inmates around the country have been convicted of violent crimes\u2014including rape, armed robbery, and murder\u2014and just 16 percent are drug offenders. Even if a lot of states do follow the federal government\u2019s lead and pass laws that take a more lenient view of nonviolent drug offenders\u2014while shying away from rethinking how the system treats violent criminals\u2014the country will only ever achieve a modest reduction in the overall prison population.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:11:03.673+0000"}

According to lawmakers in the room, Clinton \u201cdelivered a clear message: Democrats must convince the American public that action to combat Earth\u2019s rising temperatures is urgent.\u201d\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe immediate question is: Does she really mean that?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTeam Green will take some convincing. Climate activists have long been skeptical of Clinton\u2019s climate bona fides, in no small part because of her unwillingness to speak out against the Keystone XL pipeline that continues to serve as a litmus test for their movement. To date, the best indication of how she would address global warming as president came last December when, referring to the climate rules being implemented by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, she declared that \u201cthe unprecedented action that President Obama has taken must be protected at all cost.\u201d The climate crowd cheered those comments in the moment, but they remain largely underwhelmed. After all, they\u2019ve long pushed for Obama to make climate change a bigger priority so the promise of more of the same from Clinton isn\u2019t exactly a rallying cry.\n\nBut if Clinton really does try to make global warming a major campaign issue, she won\u2019t be doing it to win over the climate hawks in her party. Those voters are much more likely to find something to love about Bernie Sanders and his environmental resume than about Clinton and the millions her family foundation has received from the oil industry. And the unfortunate reality for those voters is that Hillary doesn\u2019t need to be concerned about them in the primary since she doesn\u2019t have to worry about them in the general election. The climate crowd\u2019s legitimate fears about what a climate science-denying Republican president would do will be a much greater motivating force on Election Day than their doubts about Clinton ever could be.\n\nSo, would a climate-heavy pitch help Clinton with general election voters? It\u2019s difficult to say. As I\u2019ve written about before, it\u2019s clear that\u2014all things being equal\u2014a clear majority of Americans would prefer a president who believes what the science says about global warming. But, at the same time, it\u2019s also clear that most Americans don\u2019t yet care enough about the topic to make it a defining issue at the polls.\n\nFor most voters, then, climate change isn\u2019t nearly the hot-button issue that it's made out to be inside the Beltway. It may or may not be a winning topic for Clinton, but it almost certainly won\u2019t be a losing one. A full-throated argument for climate action would, however, be in line with Clinton\u2019s other campaign messages, which while progressive in nature also poll relatively well across the political spectrum. As with criminal justice and immigration reform, Clinton isn\u2019t being pushed leftward on climate in the primary; she\u2019s going there willingly with an eye on the mainstream for 2016.\n\nOf course, campaigning on climate and acting on it are two different things. While candidates normally try to fulfill their campaign promises if they\u2019re elected, so far Clinton hasn\u2019t offered the type of specifics that would really box her in as president. And assuming she coasts to her party\u2019s nomination next summer, she won\u2019t need to offer any. Simply saying, \u201cI believe in man-made climate change\u201d or \u201cI\u2019ll do what Obama did\u201d will be more than enough to give her the upper hand on climate in a general election match-up with a Republican opponent who is arguing the opposite. Expect Clinton, then, to focus on making the case for action instead of on what that action should look like. The latter is the policy debate we need to be having, but the former is far easier to sell from the stump.\n\nElsewhere in Slate:", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:11:05.034+0000"}

Gillibrand\u2019s office told Politico that \u201cwe need to set a clear example that sexual assault will not be tolerated in this country, and someone who admitted to using drugs for sex no longer deserves the nation\u2019s highest honor.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Obama seemed to be relying on the lack of procedure and precedent in order to skirt the issue, but he does seem to have some cover for avoiding the topic. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever happened, and it\u2019s probably unlikely to happen, but there\u2019s no precedent for it,\u201d a former White House aide who led the Medal of Freedom selection process during the Reagan administration told the Hill last year about the potential for a medal to be revoked.\n\nWhile the medal appears here to stay, Obama did make a point to say\u2014without actually saying Cosby had committed a crime\u2014that the things the entertainer is accused to have done are clearly rape, and that rape is wrong.\n\n\u201cAs you know I tend to make it a policy not to comment on the specifics of cases where there might still be, if not criminal, then civil issues involved,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI\u2019ll say this: If you give a woman\u2014or a man, for that matter\u2014without his or her knowledge, a drug and then have sex with that person without consent, that\u2019s rape.

The Supreme Court recently held that the government can\u2019t single out and demean gay people anymore. But that doesn\u2019t mean the religious right won\u2019t stop trying. Post-Obergefell, it looks like we\u2019re in for anti-gay rants like this one, from the National Review\u2019s chief revanchist, David French:\n\nFrom the very beginning, the sexual revolution has been about sexual liberty, not identity, with the language of identity adopted as a political tactic. \u2026 The bottom line is that sexual expression is always about human choice. \u2026 [I]f we\u2019re finally getting honest\u2014and labeling sexual acts as moral choices\u2014then there\u2019s less grounds for punishing those people and institutions who make different moral choices, like Christian colleges, student groups, and business owners.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nFrench is writing in response to a Guardian article penned by a polyamory advocate who seeks to undermine the science behind a biological basis for homosexuality, perhaps in order to link it more closely to sexual choices like polyamory. That science, by the way, is quite strong and gets stronger with each new study. But French\u2019s credulous reliance on the inaccurate scientific views of a polyamorous gay journalist is not what interests me. Rather, his piece is fascinating for the peek it provides into the post-Obergefell anti-gay battle plan: a retreat from arguments against judicial intervention\u2014which were pretext to begin with\u2014and a renewed effort to persuade Americans that gay people are fundamentally immoral because they have gay sex.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nThis plan intertwines with the already notorious campaign for Christians to obtain a special right to discriminate against gay people. But it differs in fundamental ways. On its own, the \u201creligious liberty\u201d crusade acknowledges a defeat on one front of the culture wars\u2014the effort to keep gay people stigmatized and excluded from mainstream society. But culture warriors like French need to keep their troops\u2019 hope alive. So while Ross Douthat and his ilk withdraw into the religious liberty redoubt, French et al. are charging up the hill to fight back increasingly pro-gay public sentiment.\n\nIn earlier articles, French hinted at this tactic, declaring that \u201ccultural conservatives have barely begun to fight.\u201d His thesis is that homosexuality is like abortion: an evil to be combatted, anathema to basic Christian values. Gay marriage is wrong, he suggests, because gay sex is wrong\u2014an immoral choice, not an aspect of an immutable identity. Gay people could choose to remain celibate. Instead, they choose to have sex\u2014and demand that society and the state honor that choice by affording their relationships equal dignity. French hopes to rouse the shrinking subset of Americans who still think gay sex is nothing more than sinful debauchery.\n\nThe problem with this gambit is that it only works within deeply intolerant pockets of conservative Christianity. In his pieces, French often speaks of a \u201ctruth\u201d that gay rights violate. Dig deep enough, and you\u2019ll find that this truth is the Gospel, as interpreted in a strictly anti-gay manner. For evangelical Christians like French, that\u2019s a fine truth to live by. But French does not (and cannot) explain why his own truth should be codified into law in a country whose constitution separates church from state.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:11:29.885+0000"}

Still, an informal Trump-Cruz alliance would not be something to snicker at.

Cruz, though, is likely to stoke Trump\u2019s fire. While most of the crowded GOP field has run as fast and as far as they can away from Trump\u2019s comments painting Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, the Texas senator has defended Trump at every turn. \"I like Donald Trump,\u201d Cruz told Fox News late last month. \u201cI think he's terrific. I think he's brash. I think he speaks the truth.\"\n\nThe budding professional friendship could have a real impact in the GOP race in both the short- and long-term. Cruz and Trump could work in concert next month at the first primary debate to target establishment favorites like Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio\u2014both of whom supported a path to citizenship in the past\u2014over immigration reform. The pair would make for an interesting one-two punch: Trump\u2019s brash showmanship has helped him become a billionaire, while Cruz will be one of the strongest debaters on the Fox News stage in Cleveland. Bush and Rubio can still play the grown-up card, but tangling with Trump will be a higher-stakes game if Cruz is waiting in the wings with a more eloquent comeback than Trump is likely to offer.\n\nTrump undoubtedly loves the idea that Cruz is willing to visit his Manhattan throne to kiss his ring. But in the longer term, an informal alliance could pay the bigger dividends for Cruz. The Donald has topped two national GOP polls in the past two weeks, but his momentum is unsustainable given how unpopular he is with Republican primary voters as a whole. Once the spotlight eventually moves on to more legitimate candidates, it\u2019s difficult to imagine Trump soldiering on deep into the nominating contest. When Trump finally drops out, his supporters will need to find a new anti-immigrant horse to ride, and Cruz would be the obvious choice even if Trump doesn\u2019t offer an official endorsement.\n\nCruz is playing a significantly longer game than Trump, and is already laying the groundwork for a protracted fight with whichever of the Big Three emerges as the GOP frontrunner after the early nominating contests. Cruz likely won\u2019t be able to topple Bush, Rubio, or Scott Walker in a one-on-one fight, but he has the stamina and the campaign cash to play the Evangelical gadfly role that Rick Santorum did in 2012. Given that, Cruz can let Trump have the headlines this summer knowing that he\u2019s more likely to be the one still standing next year.\n\nElsewhere in Slate: The GOP Is Terrified of Trump\u2014But He's Not the Dark Horse Jeb Bush Should Be Worried About", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:11:39.424+0000"}

Ask a question, get a great answer. Learn from experts and access insider knowledge. You can follow Quora on Twitter, Facebook, and Google Plus.\n\nAnswer by Ty Doyle, lawyer:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI think there are a few major reasons, some of which are fair, others of which are not.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas replaced a liberal giant and trailblazer, Thurgood Marshall. It was galling to many that the first black justice and a fighter for Warren-era liberalism was replaced by an originalist who was strongly opposed to what he viewed as the Warren court's excesses. It angered many on the left that Marshall was being replaced with someone who wanted to push back on his legacy.\n\nThere's no reason the president can't appoint another black justice while Thomas is sitting, but in 20-plus years, it hasn't happened. Many people dislike the fact that the sole black justice is probably the court's most conservative member, and commentary often suggests that Thomas is not representative of black interests, even though I would note that that\u2019s not his job.\n\nFinally, Anita Hill is inescapable. If you believe her, then Thomas is a sexual harasser and predator who was unfit for the bench. Most of us who are old enough to remember Thomas\u2019 confirmation hearings\u2014among the most controversial in the 20th century\u2014made up our minds about Thomas back then. Either he was a creep or a victim of, in his words, \u201chigh tech lynching\u201d because he did not hold the expected liberal views.\n\nI think that all of the aforementioned are legitimate reasons for some to dislike Thomas\u2019 presence on the court. However, this animus has fueled a number of additional charges against Thomas, none of which are even remotely accurate. The principal claims are that Thomas is dumb, a puppet of Justice Antonin Scalia, and lazy. Let's talk about these claims in order.\n\nI will readily concede that Thomas is in many respects the most conservative justice currently sitting on the court, and one can make a coherent case that he's one of the most conservative justices to ever sit on the court. Therefore, it's easy to understand why many left-of-center individuals find Thomas' conclusions wrong\u2014often deeply wrong. But that's different from suggesting that Thomas is dumb or somehow bad at his job\u2014I think that Justice Sonia Sotomayor's legal reasoning is often sorely lacking, for example, but I would not deny that she's an extremely intelligent and capable justice who is worthy of her position on the court.\n\nThe \u201cScalia puppet\u201d theory seems to have come from the fact that love him or hate him, Scalia is a force of nature due to his big personality, his famously sharp and entertaining opinions, and his willingness to court attention and controversy. Scalia was the darling of legal circles in the 1980s and '90s, a justice who had to be acknowledged, even if people disagreed with him. Put differently, he was the one conservative who was acceptable for liberal commentators to have a \u201clegal crush\u201d on. Thomas, on the other hand, came into his job under fierce criticism, supra, and simply isn't a \u201cshow horse\u201d kind of personality. With Scalia already established as a star on the court and Thomas voting with Scalia a high percentage of the time (especially early in his career), many people (unfairly) accused Thomas of simply following Scalia, as though he couldn't be a principled originalist on his own. The reality is far different: In fact, as Jeffrey Toobin noted in a New Yorker article, in the 21st century, Thomas\u2014and not Scalia\u2014ultimately emerged as the court's right-wing intellectual leader, taking decisive (often lonely) positions in dissent and then doing the time-consuming work in the trenches to turn those dissents into majorities that would have been unfathomable even during the Rehnquist years. Any close follower of the Supreme Court could tell you that it is Thomas, not Scalia, who has been the most principled and often the boldest (and to his supporters, most courageous) conservative on the court today. Again, critics don't have to like what Thomas has done, but to call him a dim bulb or another justice's puppet has no basis in reality.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:12:11.144+0000"}

He also called for reinvestment in underprivileged communities, making the argument that unless money is spent on creating opportunities for people who might otherwise resort to crime, justice reform will only go so far.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t ask our police, or our prosecutors, or our prison guards, or our judges to bear the entire burden of containing and controlling problems that the rest of us are not facing up to and aren\u2019t willing to do something about,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cToday I\u2019ve been talking about the criminal justice system, but we have to recognize that it\u2019s not something that we can view in isolation. Any system that allows us to turn a blind eye to hopelessness and despair\u2014that\u2019s not a justice system. It\u2019s an injustice system. But that\u2019s an extension and a reflection of some broader decisions that we\u2019re making as a society. And that has to change.\u201d\n\nThe speech broke at least two pieces of news. First, the president expressed full-throated support for re-enfranchising convicted felons who have served their time. \u201cIf folks have served their time, and they\u2019ve re-entered society, they should be able to vote,\u201d he said, to loud applause. Such a change would affect approximately 4 million people around the country who currently cannot vote because of their criminal records, even though they are no longer incarcerated.\n\nSecond, Obama called for prisons around the country to take a hard look at the use of solitary confinement and revealed that he had asked Attorney General Loretta Lynch to \u201cstart a review of the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.\u201d (On the official POTUS Twitter, Obama was quoted in a way that made clear the attorney general would only be looking at federal prisons.)\n\n\u201cThe social science shows that an environment like that is often more likely to make inmates more alienated, more hostile, more violent,\u201d Obama said. \u201cDo we really think it makes sense to lock so many people alone in tiny cells for 23 hours a day for months, sometimes for years, at a time? That is not going to make us safer. That\u2019s not going to make us stronger. And if those individuals are ultimately released, how are they ever going to adapt? It\u2019s not smart. Our prisons should be a place where we can train people for skills that can help them find a job, not train them to become more hardened criminals.\u201d\n\nToward the end of the speech, the president sounded a personal note, echoing a comment he made after the death of Trayvon Martin.

The video, created by a group called the Center for Medical Progress but distributed and promoted by Live Action, shows Planned Parenthood's senior director of medical services Deborah Nucatola at a lunch meeting with people who apparently pretended to be medical research organizers seeking donated fetal tissue. But of course, Nucatola's actually dining with conservative operatives running one of the many \u201cstings\u201d that Live Action is built on promoting. (The organization has also attempted to scare people about Planned Parenthood's acceptance of patients who practice BDSM and to portray sex-selective abortion as common when it is not.) But this isn't evidence of wrongdoing. It's another masterful piece of propaganda.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nThe video purports to reveal that Planned Parenthood is violating both the ban on a certain late-term abortion procedure called a D-and-X and the law forbidding the sale of fetal tissue. But there is no evidence from the video of either claim. Nucatola correctly points out that the \u201cpartial birth\u201d abortion ban is confusing, which makes sense as it was written by anti-choice ideologues and not by people who understand medical science, making it open to interpretation. She does not say she violates it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nNucatola also does not agree to sell fetal tissue. Eric Ferrero, the vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood, clarifies this in a statement. \u201cAt several of our health centers, we help patients who want to donate tissue for scientific research, and we do this just like every other high-quality health care provider does\u2014with full, appropriate consent from patients and under the highest ethical and legal standards.\u201d He notes that there is \u201cno financial benefit for tissue donation.\u201d The prices that Nucatola cites, after being pressed to come up with a number in the video, likely refer to the \u201ccost to transport tissue to leading research centers.\u201d\n\nBut the legal accusations are just the fluff, easy to disprove and not really the point of the video. No, the real meat of the video is capturing Nucatola speaking candidly about the process of getting fetal tissue, which the heavily edited eight-minute \u201chighlight\u201d reel released by Live Action dwells on in great detail, in order to gross out the viewer. This is Live Action's typical method: being as lurid and grotesque as possible to titillate its largely conservative audience. As William Saletan laid out in painstaking detail for Slate in 2013, Live Action really knows how to zero in on those gross medical details for maximum impact.\n\nAs someone who is squeamish, it was extremely difficult for me to listen to Nucatola talk about extracting liver, heart, and other parts to be donated to medical research. (I nearly fainted when a friend showed me the video of her knee operation once.) But people who work in medicine for a living do, in fact, become inured to the gore in a way that can seem strange to those of us who aren't regularly exposed to it. She also thought she was speaking to people in her profession who would be similarly accustomed to this sort of thing.\n\nAbortion is gross, no doubt about it. It becomes grosser the later in a pregnancy it gets. But so is heart surgery. So is child-birth, for that matter. We don't deny people who need help in those cases because the help is gross. Nor should we deny people that help when it comes to needing abortion.

{"entityId": 467, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Thomas Coex/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHere\u2019s the thing to keep in mind about most critics of the Iran nuclear deal that was signed Tuesday morning: Their objections have nothing to do with the details of the deal.\n\nThe most diehard opponents\u2014Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Saudi King Salman, and a boatload of neocons led by the perennial naysayer John Bolton\u2014issued their fusillades against the accord (\u201can historic mistake,\u201d \u201cdiplomatic Waterloo,\u201d to say nothing of the standard charges of \u201cappeasement\u201d from those with no understanding of history) long before they could possibly have browsed its 159 pages of legalese and technical annexes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat worries these critics most is not that Iran might enrich its uranium into an A-bomb. (If that were the case, why would they so virulently oppose a deal that put off this prospect by more than a decade?) No, what worries them much more deeply is that Iran might rejoin the community of nations, possibly even as a diplomatic (and eventually trading) partner of the United States and Europe.\n\nEuropean leaders, especially Federica Mogherini, the EU\u2019s high representative for foreign affairs, and Philip Hammond, Great Britain\u2019s finance minister, have said that the deal holds out hope for the reopening of broad relations with Iran\u2014and that is precisely these critics\u2019 fear.\n\nNetanyahu and King Salman believe to war-war is better than to jaw-jaw.\n\nThe fear is hardly without reason. The lifting of sanctions, which this deal will trigger in the next few years, will certainly enrich Iran. This might embolden the government\u2019s expansionist tendencies and its support of militant movements across the Middle East\u2014or it might moderate the country\u2019s stance, as the population (much of it literate and pro-Western) interacts more with the rest of the world and the reigning mullahs die off. There is some basis for this hope of transformation. How long can the mullahs sustain their cries of \u201cDeath to America\u201d and their claims of Western encirclement\u2014the rationale for their oppressive domestic policies\u2014when the country\u2019s president and foreign minister, clearly with the approval of the supreme leader, are shaking hands and signing deals with the Great Satan\u2019s emissaries? Nonetheless, the hope is a gamble, and one can\u2019t blame Israelis for refusing to stake too much on its payoff.\n\nThe Saudi royal family is another matter. King Salman sees the entire Middle East through the prism of a grand Arab cold war between Sunnis and Shiites\u2014with the Shiites led by Iran and all Shiite movements, for instance the Houthi rebels in Yemen, as nothing more than Iranian proxies. It\u2019s a zero-sum game: American diplomacy with Iran, in this view, amounts to an American betrayal of Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhat Netanyahu and King Salman want Obama to do is to wage war against Iran\u2014or, more to the point, to fight their wars against Iran for them. That is why they so virulently oppose U.S. diplomacy with Iran\u2014because the more we talk with Iran\u2019s leaders, the less likely we are to go to war with them. Their view is the opposite of Winston Churchill\u2019s: They believe to war-war is better than to jaw-jaw.\n\nPresident Obama needs to be (and clearly is) sensitive to these parochial views of the region and the world, but he shouldn\u2019t (and clearly isn\u2019t) holding American interests hostage to them.\n\nNetanyahu is sure to lobby against this deal on Capitol Hill in the coming weeks, just as he lobbied against the negotiations in his dreadful but politically potent speech before Congress in March. Republicans\u2014keen to cheer the Israeli prime minister and to pummel their own president\u2014probably won\u2019t realize that they\u2019re being played as pawns in someone else\u2019s game.\n\nIt may be that Netanyahu is overplaying his hand this time. In a speech on Tuesday, he described Iran\u2019s aggression as \u201cseveral times more dangerous than that of ISIS\u201d and claimed that Iran\u2019s \u201cultimate true aim\u201d was \u201ctaking over the world.\u201d Does anyone believe this?

But how will it affect the pistachio market? Let's go to the text.\n\nScreen shot/Vox\n\n\n\nScreen shot/Vox\n\n\n\nCaviar, rugs, and pistachios are signature Iranian products that have been specifically targeted by various U.S. actions through the years since the Iranian Revolution. The lifting of certain trade-related sanctions was the major carrot that the U.S. and its partners were holding out to Iran during negotations; if Tuesday's deal proceeds as planned, the agreed-upon sanctions will come to an end in early 2016 and Americans will be able to get their hands on those products. (Not every U.S.-Iran trade sanction is related to Iran's nuclear program, which means that not every sanction will be lifted\u2014oil imports still won't be allowed, for example.*)\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI have no idea how many Americans will rush out to buy Iranian caviar or carpets\u2014I'm guessing it's a small number. But who doesn't love a good pistachio? So I wondered: Is Tuesday's news a big deal for the average American nut consumer? I reached out to Nuts.com CEO Jeff Braverman, who I once sat next to at a wedding, to get his take on the news. Jeff passed along comment from his uncle Sandy Braverman, who has worked in the nut business since the 1950s. Wrote Sandy:\n\n\n\n\"Years ago the majority of pistachios came from Iran. They were big and round and had a great nutty flavor. I believe they were the sert variety. The largest size was a 16-18 or a 14-15, which is a really big nut. And you really couldn't eat just one. They were that good. Much nuttier taste. There were Turkish pistachios around, but they were small and hard to open. However, they had great taste if you were willing to work to get them open. After the trade embargo with Iran, the California pistachio became the dominant product in the U.S. They looked great, easy to open, but to pistachio connoisseurs they tasted like cardboard. The only way you could get the Iranian was to go overseas. There was even a 300 percent duty before the current sanctions, I think starting around the hostage crisis. If they allow the Iranian pistachios in the country it may take a real bite out of the domestic market as they are far superior.\"\n\n\n\nAdded Jeff: \"We like to separate politics from business, but if our government green lights it and we feel it is ethical to sell Iranian pistachios, then we will.\"\n\nEven with sanctions in place, Iran has in recent years been the world's largest producer of pistachios\u2014per Bloomberg, the nuts are the country's second most valuable export after oil. And if you believe Sandy Braverman, Iran might just be about to crack the United States market big-time.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:12:36.458+0000"}

Photos by Scott Olson/Getty Images and Ed Zurga/Getty Images.\n\nOn Monday, if you were paying attention, you caught a glimpse of our ultrapolarized future.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nSpecifically, you saw two speeches from two candidates on opposite ends of the ideological divide. First was Hillary Clinton\u2019s marquee speech on the economy, in which after months of silence, she addressed a major question of her candidacy: Was she committed to the neoliberal path of her husband\u2019s administration and her first campaign, or would she follow the progressive economic zeitgeist of the present-day Democratic Party?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe answer, in short, is that she\u2019ll follow the zeitgeist. \u201cThe defining economic challenge of our time is clear: We must raise incomes for hard-working Americans so they can afford a middle-class life. We must drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families and lifts up our country.\u201d At the same time, said Clinton\u2014distancing herself from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama\u2014\u201cToday is not 1993 or 2009. We need solutions for the big challenges we face now.\u201d\n\nTo that end, Clinton wants a constellation of interventionist policies that directly use government to raise incomes, regulate financial firms, shape the pre-distribution of wealth, and secure middle-class families. Among her proposals are tax reform to encourage long-term business investment instead of short-term spending (like higher CEO pay); comprehensive immigration reform to bring undocumented workers into the formal economy; new federal investments in renewable energy and medical research; paid family leave, earned sick days, and subsidized child care; higher minimum wages and protection against wage theft; enhancements for Social Security and the Affordable Care Act; middle-class tax relief and greater support for young, contract, and low-income workers; and finally, new measures to strengthen and expand Dodd-Frank financial reform.\n\nThere is no middle ground or overlap between Walker\u2019s America and Clinton\u2019s coalition of blacks, Latinos, women, and young people.\n\nEven with the missing details and unanswered questions\u2014where does Clinton stand on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, does she support a Bernie Sanders\u2013style financial transactions tax\u2014this is a progressive vision, informed by the last five years of liberal populist activism, from Occupy Wall Street to the rise of Elizabeth Warren. Once a Democratic Leadership Council Democrat who cut her teeth in the age of Reagan, Clinton is now near the helm of a party that\u2019s turned left from its 1990s centrism toward a neo\u2013New Deal liberalism.*\n\nMirroring this nod to the left of the Democratic Party was Scott Walker\u2019s wave to the right wing of the Republican Party. On Monday evening, in his home state, the conservative Wisconsin governor announced his campaign for the White House. \u201cAmericans deserve a president who will fight and win for them. Someone who will stand up for the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Someone who will stand up for our religious rights and all of our other constitutional rights. Someone who will stand up for America.\u201d\n\nIf Clinton gave an agenda for liberal America, Walker sketched a wish list for its conservative counterpart. As president, Walker wants to devolve Medicaid to the states; repeal the Affordable Care Act in full; drill for oil, including completing the Keystone pipeline; cut taxes on \u201cjob creators\u201d; and reduce regulations across the board.\n\nLikewise, he wants to bring key Wisconsin policies to the country writ large. \u201cSince I\u2019ve been governor,\u201d said Walker, touting his record, \u201cwe passed lawsuit reform and regulatory reform. We defunded Planned Parenthood and enacted pro-life legislation. We passed Castle Doctrine and concealed-carry. And we now require a photo ID to vote in the state of Wisconsin.\u201d He continued: \u201cIf our reforms can work in a blue state like Wisconsin, they can work anywhere in America.\u201d\n\nBeyond concrete policy ideas, Walker stuffed his speech with red meat. He blasted public assistance\u2014\u201cThe people I\u2019ve met tell me that they didn\u2019t come here to become dependent on the government\u201d\u2014and touted America as a place where \u201cthe opportunity is equal for all, but the outcome is up to each and every one of us,\u201d as if the poor are poor because of their effort (they earned it) and not their circumstances. He praised supply-side economics and promised that tax cuts would \u201cgrow the economy,\u201d despite the poor results in Wisconsin. He touted mandatory drug tests for welfare recipients, and denounced Common Core as a \u201cnationwide school board.\u201d\n\nWalker is a top-tier contender for the GOP nomination. If he wins, he won\u2019t just bring a conservative agenda; he\u2019ll bring one from the hard right that aims for the vulnerable (cuts to services), plays to resentments (voter identification and drug tests), and appeals to his base of working- and middle-class white men.\n\nThese dueling speeches are clear: There is no middle ground or overlap between Walker\u2019s America and Clinton\u2019s coalition of blacks, Latinos, women, and young people. Which means that there\u2019s no amount of \u201cleadership\u201d\u2014of rhetorical restraint, of triangulation, of closed-door maneuvering\u2014that would yield a \u201cgoverning majority\u201d that\u2019s capable of serious progress. Indeed, there\u2019s no national\u2014or at least, no bipartisan\u2014agreement on what \u201cprogress\u201d means.\n\nLike Obama in 2008, Clinton has promised to bring the country together, but this divide is solid. If she\u2019s elected president, she\u2019ll face the same entrenched opposition as her predecessor. Which, in a way, makes Walker a bit of fresh air. He has no pretenses. \u201cFor years, the conventional wisdom was that Americans want divided government,\u201d said Walker in 2013. \u201cI think they\u2019ve seen in the last few years that that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing.\u201d What works, he said?

{"entityId": 473, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nThe crowded field of presidential hopefuls played to type on Tuesday in reacting to the news of the historic deal between Iran and six world powers. Republicans responded by bashing President Obama\u2019s negotiating skills, predicting the deal will launch a chaotic nuclear arms race in the Middle East, and calling on Congress to do all it can to scuttle the agreement. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, offered a more measured response by praising the deal while still giving herself room to take a harder line toward Iran than Obama.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\n\u201cThis is an important step in putting a lid on Iran\u2019s nuclear program,\" the former secretary of state said in Washington following a closed-door meeting with House Democrats. Clinton, though, went on to voice \u201cconcerns\u201d about the Islamic Republic\u2019s \u201cbad behavior,\u201d such as its state sponsorship of terror groups, and stressed that the terms of the deal would have to be enforced \u201cvigorously, relentlessly\u201d by the United States and its allies. \u201cAs president, I would be absolutely devoted to assuring the agreement is followed,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nAs I noted earlier today, the responses from the presidential hopefuls aren\u2019t just empty talking points. While the Republican-controlled Congress doesn\u2019t appear to have the votes to overcome Obama\u2019s promised veto of any legislation that undermines the agreement, the next president could use his or her executive authority to walk away from the deal. The Republican candidates\u2019 reactions suggest they would do just that if given the chance. Clinton\u2019s comments, meanwhile, suggests she\u2019d be willing to see it through.\n\nThat was not always a given. Years before Clinton helped initiate the talks that led to Tuesday\u2019s landmark agreement, she memorably clashed with then-Sen. Barack Obama over the issue during the 2008 primary, calling his pledge to meet personally with leaders of countries like Iran \u201cirresponsible and frankly na\u00efve.\u201d Later in the campaign, Clinton then threatened to \u201ctotally obliterate\u201d Iran if the Islamic Republic launched a nuclear strike on Israel, remarks that drew a formal U.N. complaint from Iran and that prompted Obama to compare her to President George W. Bush.\n\nClinton\u2019s more hawkish views on Iran didn\u2019t stop once she became Obama\u2019s top diplomat, as Michael Crowley documents in Politico. While she and Obama were generally on the same page during the negotiations, Clinton was much more distrusting of Tehran than her boss and significantly more willing consider conflict.\n\nSince leaving the administration, Clinton has made no secret of her skepticism, while at the same time touting the nuclear talks as a necessary and potentially fruitful step. \u201cPresident Obama has said that the odds of getting a comprehensive agreement are 50-50. I personally am skeptical that the Iranians will follow through and deliver,\u201d she told an American Jewish group last year. \u201cI\u2019ve seen many false hopes dashed over the years, but nonetheless this is a promising development and we need to test it to see what can be achieved.\u201d She\u2019s continued to try to strike that cautious balance on the campaign trail this year, warning voters in New Hampshire earlier this month that Iran remains an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to Israel, and that even once a deal was hammered out, \u201cwe will still have major problems from Iran.\u201d\n\nSuch tough talk aside, though, Clinton pretty much has to express general support of the final agreement, given the role she played in laying its groundwork. As secretary of state, she dispatched two of her top advisers to meet with their Iranian counterparts in secret at the same time the United Nations was imposing sanctions on the country. Coming out against the deal now could have damaged her diplomatic legacy, risked alienating the president and his team, and could have also provided another opening to her left for Bernie Sanders, who wasted no time trumpeting the deal as a \u201cvictory for diplomacy over saber-rattling\u201d that \u201ccould keep us from being drawn into another never-ending war.\u201d", "score": 3, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:12:49.495+0000"}

Photos by Carlos Barria /AFP/Getty Images.\n\nIn the annals of nuclear arms control accords, the deal signed with Iran on Tuesday morning is a remarkably good deal. The 159-page document\u2014titled \u201cJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action\u201d\u2014is more elaborate, detailed, and allows for more intrusive inspections than any Soviet-American arms treaty completed during the Cold War.\n\nOf course, to many, that\u2019s not good enough. For some critics, any deal with Iran is a bad deal; the very act of negotiating with the Islamic Republic is seen as tantamount to appeasement. Other critics, though, have voiced reasonable concerns: whether a deal like this, with a regime like Iran\u2019s, can be verified with any confidence; whether the West might end up lifting economic sanctions before Iran has truly abandoned its (presumed) ambitions to build nuclear weapons; and whether the sanctions can be restored, and other countermeasures be taken, if Iran is seen as cheating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe main articles of the deal have been outlined elsewhere, and no serious critic can dispute their merits. If Iran observes the deal\u2019s terms, all paths to a nuclear bomb\u2014whether through enriched uranium or plutonium\u2014will be cut off for at least 10 years. (Those who object that 10 years is like the blink of an eye have got to be kidding. These same people warn that Iran could build a bomb within one year from now. Which outcome is preferable?) The real question, then, is what the agreement does to help ensure that Iran observes the deal.\n\nIn fact, it does quite a lot. When this round of the talks got under way last month in Vienna, Iran\u2019s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, made some statements that raised a lot of eyebrows: He said that sanctions must be lifted upon the signing of a deal and that no international inspectors would be allowed on Iranian military sites. I\u2019ve supported these negotiations, but even I wrote that if Khamenei\u2019s words held sway, no final deal was possible.\n\nAs it turns out, whatever the supreme leader\u2019s motive was in making those remarks, they are not reflected in the deal signed Tuesday morning.\n\nThe timing of sanctions-relief is addressed in Annex V of the document, and it\u2019s very clear that nothing gets lifted right away. This is a step-by-step process.\n\nThe first step is \u201cAdoption Day,\u201d which occurs 90 days after the deal is endorsed by the U.N. Security Council. On that day, the United States and the European Union start taking legal steps to lift certain sanctions\u2014while Iran must pass the Additional Protocol of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which allows for onsite inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency) and issue a statement on \u201cPast and Present Issues of Concern,\u201d acknowledging or explaining military aspects of its nuclear program in the past. (Many critics were certain that Iran would never own up to this obligation.)\n\nIf the deal falls apart, especially if it falls apart because of the U.S. Congress, then Iran will grow in strength.\n\nThe second step is \u201cImplementation Day.\u201d This is when the West really starts to lift sanctions, but only \u201cupon the IAEA-verified implementation by Iran of the nuclear-related measures\u201d\u2014that is, only after international inspectors are satisfied that Iran has fulfilled its main responsibilities in freezing and reducing elements of its nuclear program. Section 15 of Annex V lists 11 specific requirements that Iran must have fulfilled, including converting the Arak heavy-water research reactor, so it can no longer produce plutonium; reducing the number of centrifuges and halting production of advanced centrifuges; slashing its uranium stocks; and completing all \u201ctransparency measures\u201d to let the inspectors do their job.\n\nThe third step is \u201cTransition Day,\u201d when more sanctions are dropped. This happens eight years after Adoption Day, and even then only after the IAEA Board of Governors issues a report, concluding \u201cthat all nuclear material in Iran remains in peaceful activities.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:12:57.767+0000"}

The \u201creset\u201d in relations with Vladimir Putin\u2019s Russia was already strained by disagreements over the Middle East when Obama came into office, and now lies in wreckage in the battlefields of eastern Ukraine. A tentative effort at outreach to Bashar al-Assad, spearheaded by then-Sen. John Kerry, collapsed after the Syrian leader began his bloody crackdown in 2011. The jury is still out on the 2012 opening to Myanmar, which saw sanctions relief in return for democratic reforms and the release of prisoners. Lately the Burmese government has appeared to be backsliding on some of its commitments and has drawn international condemnation for its persecution of the Rohingya minority.\n\nIt\u2019s only in the past few months that we\u2019ve really seen the open hand that Obama promised in 2009, first in December with the restoration of diplomatic ties with Cuba after five decades, and now with today\u2019s nuclear deal. After years of a foreign policy defined less by diplomatic outreach than the aggressive use of drones, a troop surge in Afghanistan, and new military interventions in Libya and Iraq (as well as the less-than-inspiring mantra \u201cdon\u2019t do stupid shit\u201d) we\u2019re finally seeing something resembling the new approach to foreign policy that Obama campaigned on.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:13:05.631+0000"}

Several months earlier the last convoy of U.S. troops had left Iraq, and their return seemed inconceivable. The fall of Bashar al-Assad at the hands of Syrian rebels was thought to be only a matter of time. Al-Qaida appeared to be on the ropes after the death of Osama Bin Laden, and its Iraqi affiliate would not rebrand itself as ISIS until the following year. The Muslim Brotherhood\u2019s Mohamed Morsi had just been elected president of Egypt, a position he would hold for a year before being deposed. The enthusiastically pro-U.S. Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi was in power in Yemen. And the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and the \u201cInnocence of Muslims\u201d protests were months away.\n\nJoshua Keating Joshua Keating is a staff writer at Slate focusing on international affairs.\n\nIn other words, three years ago it was reasonable to argue that Iran\u2019s nuclear program, and the prospect of a regional war over it, was the Mideast\u2019s most pressing security concern. Today, with the president describing the new deal as an attempt to \u201ctest whether this region, which has known so much suffering, so much bloodshed, can move in a different direction,\u201d the agreement to stop Iran\u2019s nuclear program feels almost quaint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIran has managed to expand its regional influence pretty effectively without nukes. Iranian-backed Shiite rebels are leading the fight against ISIS in Iraq, Assad remains in power in Syria, and despite months of Saudi airstrikes, Houthi rebels still control the Yemeni capital. The region\u2019s chaos has been good to Iran, and critics of this deal argue that sanctions relief will allow it to expand that influence.\n\nOf course, Iran\u2019s regional efforts haven\u2019t exactly been slowed down that much by the sanctions, so it\u2019s hard to imagine that it will suddenly become that much more influential. I tend to agree more with the Obama administration\u2019s reasoning, which counters that chaotic as things are, they\u2019d be even worse with nuclear weapons. Plus, a less hostile relationship between Iran and the West could open up avenues for cooperation on other issues, such as resolving the conflict in Syria. Of course, what alarms Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as leaders in the Gulf states almost as much as an Iranian nuke is the notion that the U.S. will increasingly find its interests aligned with Iran\u2019s.\n\nWe\u2019re not quite at that point yet. It\u2019s worth remembering amid the good vibes today that Iran is still imprisoning U.S. citizens on absurd, trumped-up charges\u2014essentially holding them hostage. And while it\u2019s true that the U.S. is in a tacit partnership with Iranian-backed militias in the war against ISIS in Iraq, there\u2019s a good case to be made that Iran is playing both sides of the conflict: The Iranian-backed Assad has allowed ISIS to spread in Syria, and at times even helped it.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:13:10.431+0000"}

Obama has promised to veto any legislation that undermines the effort\u2014and appears to have enough Democratic support to avoid a veto-override\u2014but the president would obviously prefer to avoid a protracted political fight that could jeopardize a deal that his administration spent nearly two years negotiating.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nEven assuming the deal survives the 60-day review period, though, it might not survive the next administration. Since the deal is a political agreement\u2014and not a legally binding treaty\u2014the next president could, as Politico\u2019s Nahal Toosi explains, simply use his or her executive authority to reinstate the suspended U.S. sanctions on Iran and/or withdraw from the international panels tasked with implementing the accord. That means that those Republican stump speeches bashing the deal\u2014and more generally the president\u2019s willingness to negotiate in the first place\u2014could be more than just empty bluster. It\u2019ll also be worth keeping a close eye on Hillary Clinton\u2019s reaction given the former secretary of state is generally seen as more hawkish than her former boss, and since the two memorably clashed during the 2008 campaign on the issue of negotiating with Iran.\n\nWe\u2019ll be rounding up the candidates\u2019 responses below as they come in this morning, although there\u2019s not much doubt about where most of the GOP candidates stand: They hate it.\n\nLindsey Graham to Bloomberg:\n\nIf the initial reports regarding the details of this deal hold true, there\u2019s no way as president of the United States I would honor this deal.

It shrinks Iran\u2019s nuclear complex down to a token capability and wraps it in a permanent inspection and monitoring regime.\n\nThe new agreement doesn\u2019t overthrow the clerical regime ruling Iran. It doesn\u2019t change Iran\u2019s policies toward Israel or its Arab neighbors. And it doesn\u2019t force Iran to end the repression of its own people.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe agreement forged between Iran and the world\u2019s powers does only one thing, but it is a big one: It reverses and contains what most experts consider the greatest nuclear proliferation challenge in the world. Whatever else Iran may do in the world, it will not do it backed with the threat of a nuclear weapon.\n\nThe beauty of this agreement is that Iran gets to keep its buildings and we get to take out all the furniture.\n\nU.S. negotiators went into the Iran talks with three key objectives: cut off all of Iran\u2019s pathways to a nuclear bomb, put in place a monitoring system to catch any Iranian cheating, and keep together the global coalition that can snap back sanctions if Iran breaks the deal. After 22 months of hard bargaining they have emerged with that and more. This detailed 100-plus-page agreement dismantles much of Iran\u2019s nuclear program, freezes it, and puts a camera on it.\n\nThe deal eliminates the three ways Iran could build a bomb.\n\nFirst, without the deal, Iran could use its centrifuges to purify enough uranium for one or more bombs within weeks. These high-tech machines are the size and shape of water heaters but made of specialized metal alloys. They spin uranium gas at supersonic speeds, cascading the gas through assemblies of thousands of machines. When it reaches a purity level of about 5 percent, the gas can be turned into a powder form used to make fuel rods for nuclear reactors.\n\nIran says that is all it wants to do\u2014make fuel. The problem is that the same machines in the same facilities can keep going until the uranium is enriched to 90 percent purity. Then the gas can be turned into the metal core of a weapon.\n\nThis deal blocks that path. Iran has agreed to rip out over two-thirds of the 19,000 centrifuges it has installed. Just over 5,000 centrifuges will be allowed to continue enriching uranium. All will be located at one facility at Natanz. The deep underground facility at Fordow that so worried Israeli planners (since it could not be destroyed with their weapons) will be shrunk to a couple of hundred operating centrifuges\u2014and these are prohibited from doing any uranium enrichment. They will be used to purify other elements and be closely monitored.\n\nFurthermore, Iran must shrink its stored stockpile of uranium gas from some 10,000 kilograms to just 300 kilograms\u2014and cannot enrich any uranium above 3.67 percent. This limit lasts for 15 years.\n\nTogether, these cuts mean that even if Iran tried to renege on the agreement, it would take it at least a year to make enough uranium for one bomb\u2014more than enough time to detect the effort and take economic, diplomatic, or military steps to stop it.\n\nUranium path, blocked.\n\nWithout the deal there is a second way Iran could make a bomb\u2014with plutonium. The bomb at Hiroshima was made of uranium; the bomb at Nagasaki was made of plutonium. Unlike uranium, plutonium does not exist in nature. It is made inside nuclear reactors, as part of the fission process, and then extracted from the spent fuel rods. Iran is constructing a research reactor at Arak that would have produced about 8 kilograms of plutonium each year, or enough theoretically for about two bombs.\n\nUnder the new deal, Iran has agreed to completely reconfigure the Arak reactor so that it will produce less than 1 kilogram a year. The old core will be shipped out of the country. Further, Iran has agreed to never build facilities that could reprocess fuel rods and all spent fuel will be shipped out the country.\n\nPlutonium path, blocked.\n\nFinally, without the deal Iran could try to build a covert facility where it could secretly enrich uranium. The verification and monitoring system required by this deal makes that all but impossible.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:13:19.117+0000"}

Under the final deal, a U.N. weapons embargo will remain in place for five years and a ban on Iran buying missile technology for eight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nReaching the deal has been a major political goal of President Barack Obama, who came into office pledging to normalize relations with America\u2019s traditional foes and has sold this deal as a way of stabilizing long-simmering tensions in the Middle East. It\u2019s also a huge step for Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, who has staked his presidency on winning international sanctions relief to improve his country\u2019s struggling economy. While it could take years for the full political ramifications of the deal to play out, the agreement is still the most important diplomatic breakthrough between the U.S. and Iran since the revolution and hostage crisis of 1979.\n\nNot everyone is enthusiastic about the deal, which will leave much of Iran\u2019s nuclear infrastructure in place. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has already denounced the agreement as \u201ca bad mistake of historic proportions\u201d that will put Iran on \u201ca sure path to nuclear weapons.\u201d\n\nThe deal is a political agreement rather than a legally binding treaty, which would require ratification by Congress. Nonetheless, under legislation signed in April, Congress will have 60 days to review the agreement, giving opponents a last chance to scuttle it.\n\nUpdate, July 14, 2015, 7:00 a.m. The Russian government has posted what appears to be the full text of the deal:\n\nUpdate, July 14, 2015, 7:30 a.m. In a televised statement from the White House, which significantly was also carried live on Iranian state television, President Obama with Vice President Joe Biden at his side began what could be the tough process of selling the deal to skeptics both in Washington and around the world. \u201cWe must continue to test whether this region which has known so much suffering, so much bloodshed, can move in a different direction,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president acknowledged that concerns remain about Iran\u2019s support for international terrorism and international terrorism, and that U.S. sanctions related to those issues would still remain in place, but argued that \u201cyou don\u2019t make deals with your friends\" and that \u201can Iran armed with a nuclear weapon would be far more destabilizing and far more dangerous to our friends and to the world.\u201d\n\nHe thanked \u201cmembers of congress who have put in place the sanctions that proved so effective\u201d but vowed to \u201cveto any legislation that prevents the successful implementation of this deal.\u201d\n\nHe also promised to continue security cooperation with Israel and the Gulf States, both of which have been highly skeptical that the deal will prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nUpdate, July 14, 2015, 8:20 a.m. On first glance, the final deal seems pretty close to what was described in the framework agreement reached last April. Iran is allowed to keep 5,060 centrifuges running at the facility at Natanz. The country will be allowed to keep 300 kilograms of uranium enriched to 3.67 percent for the next 15 years. This is not enough material to produce an atomic bomb and U.S. officials say that Iran\u2019s \u201cbreakout time\u201d\u2014the time necessary to produce enough material for a weapon\u2014will be at least a year for the next decade. Any enriched uranium above that level will have to be diluted or shipped out of the country. The enrichment center at Fordow will be converted to a research center and no fissile material can be brought there.\n\nThe deal provides for 15 years of continuous monitoring of Iran\u2019s centrifuges by inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency and daily access for those inspectors to Natanz. Inspectors \u201cmay request access\u201d to other facilities if there are concerns about undeclared nuclear material or activities.\n\nIf Iran is believed not to be complying with the agreement, states can file a complaint with an arbitration board comprised of the six powers, the EU and Iran, which will have 30 days to review it. The complaint can then be brought to the U.N. Security Council, which will have up to 35 days to decide to continue lifting sanctions, before they are reimposed. In total, this will allow international sanctions to be reapplied within 65 days if Iran found to be in violation.\n\nAs for the pace of sanctions relief, which has been a major sticking point between the two sides since April, the deal splits implementation into several key dates.\n\nAfter today, \u201cfinalization day,\u201d the deal will be immediately submitted to the U.N. Security Council for approval. Ninety days after it is approved will be \u201cadoption day,\u201d when all the parties will make legal arrangements for their commitments.

Repeatedly the word was ladled over the sweltering supporters gathered in a local expo center that took on the close and aromatic aspect of a sweat lodge. Speaker after speaker testified to Walker\u2019s boldness before he walked the runway to his place in the middle of the boisterous crowd. The candidate used the word a couple of times himself.\n\nBut when Walker spoke there was nothing terribly bold about what he said. He supports growth, security, and America. He supports a garden-variety Republican platform\u2014repealing Obamacare, building the Keystone Pipeline, removing regulations, and lowering taxes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s nothing revolutionary in that set of prescriptions. It\u2019s actually less bold than what some of his opponents are offering. But Walker is the boldest Republican candidate running. Anyone can offer ideas and policy proposals. With Walker, GOP voters can easily imagine that he\u2019ll follow through.\n\nIn this modern age of hyperpartisan combat, no one running has consistently succeeded when fighting for conservative principles the way Walker has. Actually fighting and winning conservative fights is what voters are hungry for. That\u2019s why Walker used the word \u201cwin\u201d six times.\n\nThe crowd wasn\u2019t just rooting for Walker, but for an America where the advancing liberals are vanquished.\n\nWhere the candidates announce their candidacies tells you about their campaign. Jeb Bush chose Miami Dade College so that the tableau of diverse faces could speak to his effort to expand the Republican Party. Bush has since talked about the makeup of that crowd and how it doesn\u2019t look like the typical Republican electorate. Walker\u2019s crowd was 99 percent white, and he spoke in Waukesha County, a bright red Republican stronghold. Wisconsin is purple, but Walker has won by making the red parts redder. Unlike Bush, who seeks to be a synthesis candidate reaching out to new constituencies, Walker's promise to Republicans hungry for a presidential win is that he\u2019ll amp up conservative turnout.\n\nWalker never mentioned same-sex marriage, and he only quickly referred to abortion, but his pitch had echoes of what you would expect from a culture warrior. He is the one who not only beats liberals, but puts them in their place.\n\nThe audience cheered most loudly when he mentioned requiring a photo ID to vote, a concealed-carry handgun law that he had passed, and one establishing the castle doctrine. Those are policy positions, but they are also fault lines with liberals. The crowd wasn\u2019t just rooting for Walker; they were rooting for a vision of America where the advancing liberals are vanquished. In the video montage that played before Walker appeared in his casual-Friday shirtsleeves, liberals like Ed Shultz and Rachel Maddow were shown despondent that Walker had survived the recall election so easily. Walker\u2019s recall was presented not just as a victory for him but the moment \u201cwhen America, got her voice back,\u201d as one speaker put it.\n\nIf there\u2019s one candidate Walker is aiming at with all of his talk of winning, it\u2019s Sen. Ted Cruz. Walker and Cruz are the two best-funded competitors running to be the conservative standard-bearer. Walker\u2019s argument is that while Cruz may talk a good game, he has no concrete accomplishments. Walker made an unmistakable reference to Cruz in his announcement video. \u201cIn the Republican field there are some who are good fighters, but they haven\u2019t won those battles,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are others who\u2019ve won elections, but haven\u2019t consistently taken on the big fights.

Hillary Clinton will reveal the names of her top fundraisers, her campaign confirmed to the New York Times on Monday:\n\nThe decision was communicated in recent days to her top fund-raisers, known as \u201cbundlers\u201d because they bundle together contributions from networks of friends and business associates. Because candidates can only accept a few thousand dollars from any one donor, campaigns rely on teams of hundreds of such volunteers to raise a substantial portion of the hundreds of millions of dollars now needed to sustain a competitive presidential bid.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nCandidates are only required to disclose the names of bundlers if they are registered lobbyists, so Clinton\u2019s decision to release a full list is a pretty clear attempt to go above and beyond what is currently required by law. By offering voters a look at the names of her top fundraisers\u2014and, by extension, the industries they represent\u2014Clinton is hoping to generate some goodwill in the transparency department, an area that isn\u2019t exactly her strongest. Still, regardless of an individual candidate\u2019s motivations, more is almost always better for voters when it comes to information about who is bankrolling a particular campaign.\n\nClinton\u2019s decision isn't a surprise\u2014she released similar information during her 2008 campaign\u2014but it should put pressure on her rivals to follow her lead. Currently, no other White House hopeful on either side of the aisle has made the same pledge. (President Obama revealed his bundlers in both of his campaigns; Mitt Romney did not in 2012, while John McCain did in 2008.)\n\nAs an added bonus for Clinton, her decision also aligns relatively well with her larger promise to reform the nation's campaign finance system. As I noted when she first made that promise in April, making such an overhaul a chief pillar of her campaign was a somewhat awkward proposition for Hillary since she stands to benefit so much from the very same system she\u2019s decrying as unfair and undemocratic. She might not be willing to unilaterally disarm in the Citizens United-fueled campaign spending wars, but by releasing her bundler list she will at least have something specific to point to on the stump.\n\nSuch transparency is not completely without risk, of course. Conservatives are no doubt eager to dig through the list looking for any questionable connections.

Scott Walker is making it official: He\u2019s running for president. Unlike most other candidates in this overstuffed melee of a nomination fight\u2014thus far, there are 15 formal candidates for the GOP crown\u2014Walker is a candidate to beat, and perhaps the candidate to beat.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nLike Ted Cruz or Mike Huckabee, Walker appeals to conservative Republicans. But his vehicle is action, not petty outrage or high-wire antics: With every successful fight against liberal interest groups\u2014from unions to academics\u2014he wins more acclaim from the right\u2019s rank and file. At the same time, his restrained rhetoric and cautious demeanor gives him an opening with Republican elites, who want a strong\u2014but measured\u2014nominee. Add his fundraising prowess to the mix and you have a base-driven candidate with \u201cestablishment\u201d bona fides who doesn\u2019t alienate the other factions of the Republican Party\u2014a potent profile for a presidential hopeful.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn terms of stagecraft, the most important fact about Walker is his affable, if boring, presentation. Despite his right-wing views on everything under the sun\u2014from worker\u2019s rights and economic regulation to climate change and voter access\u2014he seems like an ordinary accountant or middle-manager who just wants to put a few things in order. And to bolster that image, Walker touts his \u201ceveryman\u201d bona fides\u2014his reliance on the Kohl\u2019s department store for clothing and other everyday items\u2014and stresses his experience in the Wisconsin governor\u2019s mansion.\n\nFor Walker, there\u2019s nothing he might face as president that doesn\u2019t have an analogue in Madison\u2019s statehouse. When asked how he\u2019d handle ISIS, for example, Walker told an audience at the Conservative Political Action Conference in February that if he can \u201ctake on 100,000 protesters\u201d\u2014a nod to the 2012 recall election\u2014he can \u201cdo the same across the globe.\u201d Indeed, he\u2019s all but summarized his pitch to Republican voters\u2014and the nation writ large\u2014with a single line: \u201cGovernors,\u201d he said in a 2014 interview, \u201cmake much better presidents than members of Congress.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately for Walker, it\u2019s not clear that the GOP public agrees. Of the past six Republican presidential nominees\u2014Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bob Dole, George W. Bush, John McCain, and Mitt Romney\u2014three were governors, and three were lawmakers of one shape or another. Likewise, it\u2019s also unclear if this assertion\u2014key to Walker\u2019s general pitch\u2014is true, period.\n\nSince the end of World War II, we\u2019ve had 12 presidents. Four were governors before entering the White House (Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, and George W. Bush), two were senators (John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama), four were vice presidents (Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, and George H.W. Bush), and two had unusual pre-election backgrounds: Dwight Eisenhower was a general, and Gerald Ford was House minority leader turned replacement vice president turned incumbent after Nixon\u2019s resignation.\n\nIf there\u2019s any experience with a clear connection to presidential success, it\u2019s vice presidential experience.\n\nIt would be one thing if the governors had stellar records and their peers were less successful. But the truth is that we\u2019re looking at a collection of mixed records. Among the gubernatorial presidents, neither Carter nor Bush had successful presidencies, at least judged in political terms: Carter blundered through four years and lost re-election, while Bush led the country into two wars and an economic crisis, nearly crippling the GOP in the process. On the other side, Reagan and Clinton had considerable political success but mixed records of terrible inaction and foolhardy changes to the status quo (although Reagan stands as one of the most substantively conservative presidents of the postwar period).\n\nThe senators, likewise, have mixed records. Despite his huge presence in America\u2019s political mythology, Kennedy was a middling president whose stature owes more to his sudden death than it does to any actual accomplishment. It\u2019s still too early to judge Obama\u2019s administration, but at the moment, it\u2019s fair to say that he\u2019s been a consequential steward of the United States, shepherding the nation through a global recession, a large expansion of the federal government, demographic changes, and seismic shifts to American cultural life.\n\nIt seems obvious, but if there\u2019s any experience with a clear connection to presidential success, it\u2019s vice presidential experience. Even the worst-off vice presidents\u2014estranged from their presidents and burdened with trivial responsibilities\u2014gain valuable skills from their experience in close proximity to the Oval Office. They build strong political networks, hone their ability to speak to large crowds, and most importantly learn to engage and operate in the federal bureaucracy. The least glamorous part of the presidency is the bureaucracy; a given White House is responsible for staffing thousands of positions across every department of the federal government. At the same time, however, this is vital to the effective exercise of presidential power. A president who isn\u2019t able to exert his will through the bureaucracy is a president who is hamstrung in his ability to make policy and potentially vulnerable to mistakes, missteps, and disasters in those federal agencies. The catastrophe of healthcare.gov\u2014which wounded the Affordable Care Act at a critical moment\u2014is a perfect example of the perils of a weak hold on the bureaucracy. (Obama, in fact, has been unusually bad at using and utilizing bureaucratic power.)\n\nWhat\u2019s striking about the presidents with vice presidential pedigree (and Eisenhower, for that matter, who served at the highest summit of the military bureaucracy) is that they were highly effective with bureaucratic levers as well as political and congressional ones. It is a consistent fact of their administrations in a way that isn\u2019t true of every president with gubernatorial experience (George W. Bush is the possible exception). Johnson entrenched his Great Society and civil rights reforms with agencies devoted to accomplishing these goals; Nixon defused political opponents by co-opting them and their goals into his administration; and George H.W. Bush entrenched conservative priorities at the judicial level of American government, appointing more judges in a single term than any president other than Franklin Roosevelt.\n\nTo get back to Walker, there\u2019s nothing about his experience as governor that makes him plainly superior to his competitors from the Senate and elsewhere. In fact, he may have the one glaring weakness of governors-turned\u2013presidential candidates: micromanagement. On Saturday, the New York Times described a Walker who has \u201clong been his own strategist,\u201d who thinks like a \u201cpolitical operative,\u201d and who has a tendency to \u201cplay consultant.\u201d In the context of state governance and state campaigns, the hands-on approach can work well. But at the national level, it can lead to big missteps and larger mistakes. Just ask Jimmy Carter.

We have no humility. We believe we are exceptional. That\u2019s fine. But if that is the standard, then I have the right to hold you to that standard. We don\u2019t go to Iraq saying we are doing what every country does. We are the deliverers of democracy. But this is a human problem.\n\nThe history of the world is more powerful people repressing less powerful ones, whether it is men and women or colonialism. Do you think America is unique? Is slavery unique? Or is it our version of something every society does?\n\n[Laughs]. OK, you see these black folks who are disproportionately poorer and prone to crime and suffering crime, live in neighborhoods where it doesn\u2019t appear that folks are keeping stuff up, and there is a steady background white noise saying that these people kinda deserve it, that they are lazier than you are, not as intelligent as you are, and when you receive some history about how folks ended up in that state you get two things: first, you\u2019re told that it happened a long time ago, and second, that it has no impact on what it does right now. That\u2019s a lie. That\u2019s poisonous. That myth about black people is deeply tied into the Lost Cause. Nikki Haley says Roof perverted the flag. No, he correctly understood what it stood for. It stood for the right to take people\u2019s bodies. We have a responsibility for the perpetration of that lie.\n\nSure I do. Dylann Roof is not the only person who bears responsibility. The Confederate flag represents an attempt to perpetrate a lie about American history, to bury the fact that half this country thought it was a good idea to raise an empire rooted in slavery. That is a part of our history. When you bury that history other people take control of it and use the flag for their purposes, and to ennoble their own hatred. Putting off the discussion allows the narrative of white supremacy. We really empowered that dude. It is very, very sad. But wait, I want to go back and make a point, it is a very important point and I want to make it as clear as I can.\n\nYour book is a lot about people who are victims of circumstance and history. Do you ever look at Dylann Roof like that, as a victim of history from the other side?\n\nIt is a huge theme on right wing talk radio. Aha, look, people can forgive, as if the rest of us shouldn\u2019t be upset by this racist act.\n\nIt is not my tradition. I wasn\u2019t raised with that Christianity. I don\u2019t know that I view it as inauthentic but I don\u2019t know that I understand it. I do understand how hate eats at the soul and how to purge yourself of hate. But I also know that if you come into someone\u2019s house of worship and kill their mothers and fathers and sisters, it is human to hate that person. You have a right to hate that person. And you have a right to work through that hatred. I think that sometimes gets lost when we talk about black folks with legitimate feelings. It is human. People get angry, people hate other people. If I was turned off by anything it was the comfort that people took in that forgiveness.\n\nLet\u2019s talk a bit about Charleston. What did you think of the speed of the forgiveness that some of the families of the victims exhibited?\n\nWell, I know marriage equality happened, and I know people think this is a particular moment, with the flag coming down, which is a real thing, but I don\u2019t know that this is a moment. I am not convinced of that. What does my man say? \u201cIt\u2019s too soon to tell.\u201d [Laughs.] We are in the midst of it. I don\u2019t really see any evidence. People might be reading certain things. You have an African-American president. Those are facts. You have a situation in which people have cellphone videos and people are recording acts by the police. But you are talking to someone who has known these things were going on for a very, very long time, so it\u2019s hard to see this as a new moment. Prince Jones was killed 15 years ago. His mom has been thinking about that for 15 years. It\u2019s hard to think of it as a new moment because people are now paying attention. It might be. I just don\u2019t know.\n\nAt the same time as this racial conversation there has been one about gender issues and gay rights. The latter has been reflected legislatively too. Do you see this as being part of the same trend?\n\nI can speak for me personally. For me, my writing benefits from my experience. I am better than I was 10 years ago. I have a better ability to say things that people say is quote unquote \u201cradical\u201d and evidence them. I was never much of a shouter but I have a better sense of how to do that. I think I just have a better sense. I started when I was 20. I am 40 this year.\n\nThat\u2019s probably true. In fact I can tell you that is definitely true.\n\nYour own career is interesting because I don\u2019t know if your mainstream success could have happened five or 10 years ago.\n\nI think at places like Slate or the magazine where I work, there was a really poor record of hiring African-American writers. It was really that simple. And I think with the proliferation of the Internet and Internet media, it has been a little harder to maintain that gatekeeper position. It also used to be, in the 1990s, that a large number of African-American writers who wrote for places like the Atlantic and the New Republic were drawn out of the same social world. That was my impression. It was natural to reach to Harvard, to go to the Ivy League and find the smartest black person who would write the long essay. There is still some of that, but it isn\u2019t as predominate. Jamelle [Bouie] went to UVA. Jelani [Cobb] went to Howard.\n\nIf you look at the so-called conversation about race in this country, and in the media outlets that we read and write for, it seems as if the discussion is much more forthright than it was even five years ago. Do you think this is a sign of societal progress?\n\nWe talked about the Charleston shooting, Obama\u2019s forthcoming departure from the White House, and the legacy of To Kill a Mockingbird . The interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\n\nCoates has been writing about race at the Atlantic since 2008. Last year, his cover story making the case for slavery reparations became one of the most read pieces in the magazine\u2019s history. Despite his argumentative approach to journalism, Coates is, off the page, soft-spoken and solicitous. He is adamant that he is a writer, not an activist, and seems slightly bemused by his giant following on social media and among opinion-makers.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates\u2019 new book, Between the World and Me , takes the form of an open letter to the author\u2019s son. In this short work, Coates focuses on the ways in which black Americans have been exploited and terrorized throughout American history. Like all of Coates\u2019 work, it is passionate and occasionally angry, but tightly written and lyrical.\n\nDid your son read the book?\n\nYeah, several times.\n\nDid he or your wife have any comments?\n\nMy wife helped me, as always, conveying the points I wanted to convey. We had conversations. I wouldn\u2019t have done it if folks didn\u2019t want me to do it. But everyone was pretty much pleased with what I came up with.\n\nThat\u2019s what they tell you. Wait until I get them on the phone. I want to ask about corporal punishment. In the book, you ascribe its prevalence among blacks to the terror that the black community has suffered historically. I wasn\u2019t certain about that connection. Is there a danger of ascribing too much to the past?\n\nWell first of all, for most of human history people have hit children. The horror we have about hitting kids in America is certainly not shared throughout the world. So black people are not particularly original. But African-Americans are by and large, not wholly, Southern people. But in addition to hitting their kids more than whites at every socioeconomic level, period, they are just harsh on their kids, and I think in large degree that is a response to the fact that they know there is significantly less of a shot at a second chance. You can pay with your life. The consequences for black folks are so much higher. And I think folks are resolved to scare the hell out of their kids. Having said all that, and it\u2019s important to say all that, I told my son recently, and I hit him four times, that if I had to do it again, I never would have hit him. I just wouldn\u2019t have done it. It\u2019s still violence. You are perpetrating the thing you are trying to get them to stay out of the way of. I was young when my son was born and I was scared as hell that he would wind up a drug dealer or in prison or whatever.\n\nYou are the subject of the cover story in this week\u2019s New York magazine. The article points out that you recently suggested that maybe we should free everyone from prison. Do you say things like that to get the ball rolling, or do you really believe it?\n\nTwo things I will say: the first is that I was addressing the myth that lies behind a lot of this criminal justice reform, that if one just ended the war on drugs, we would somehow be OK. You have to think about violent crime. There is a dishonest conversation saying if we just let off some people who were caught with marijuana, we\u2019d be OK. We have to think about it. Someone shoots someone at 20, should we let them out at 65? We have to think about that.\n\nOK but how do you think of your role in the debates?\n\nI don\u2019t think about that.\n\nYou never think, \u201cI have a huge following, a huge presence\u2014\u201d\n\nNo. No. No. No. Not at all. I am a writer. That is hard, going back to what we talked about earlier, why it is hard for me to assess a moment. I am distant from the process. To observe and speak and write as truthfully as I can. This is not false modesty. I came to the Atlantic in 2008. I was a formed person when I came. By the time the publicity started, I was like 36, 37 years old. I was comfortable with the idea of being a writer who went home and raised kids and had dinner with his wife. There is no reason to be different now. I am glad people are watching. It\u2019s nice to see. But my approach\u2014it would be very hard to shift it now.\n\nWhat do you say to people who want to be activists? What should I, say\u2014an educated white guy who thinks there is too much racism\u2014do to make change?\n\nEvery person has to answer it for themselves. I could say, \u201cgo register voters\u201d but you may not like doing that.\n\nOK but I am wondering what you think needs to be done and how to do it. Is there something that you think is overlooked?\n\nThe obvious thing to my mind is the history. To be as conscious as possible of the history of the country you are living in. You should read up on the sociology. But I think that of every American. Beyond that, that\u2019s a question for activists. It isn\u2019t really how I come at it. Writing is a very solitary activity. It\u2019s hard to tell someone to go do X, Y, and Z.\n\nDo you know if the president has read the book?\n\nI don\u2019t.\n\nWe always heard about the effect a black president would have on black people. Do you think a black president leaving office will have some effect on black people? How will people respond?\n\nYeah, I think people are going to be depressed as hell. I think people are going to be depressed about Obama not being in office. I think in about five to 10 years the amount of sheer racism that Barack and Michelle and their children had to deal with will become evident. I think the fact that roughly half of a major political party believed he was either from Kenya or Muslim or needed to show his birth certificate will be seen as crazy. And not just crazy, but evidence of racism.\n\nAs opposed to now, when they seem sane.\n\nThe other day [Donald Trump] just declared it. I\u2019m serious!\n\nThey\u2019re batty.\n\nIt\u2019s America.

{"entityId": 490, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nHillary Clinton is nervous\u2014and the second-largest teachers\u2019 union in the country wants to help. On Saturday, two days before Clinton\u2019s big economic policy speech, the 1.6 million-member American Federation of Teachers announced the first big union endorsement in the 2016 cycle when it came out for the Democratic front-runner. From AFT President Randi Weingarten\u2019s plug:\n\nHillary Clinton, a product of public schools herself, believes in the promise of public education. From early childhood learning through higher education, she sees how that promise can create real opportunity for kids, building a much-needed bridge to the middle class. Hillary understands that to reclaim the promise of public education, policymakers need to work with educators and their unions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe choice of Clinton is not exactly a shocker: She and Weingarten have been tight since Clinton was a New York senator and Weingarten the head of New York\u2019s United Federation of Teachers, and Weingarten sits on the board of the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action. The AFT supported Clinton during her bruising primary against Obama in 2008. In subsequent years, it\u2019s unlikely that the big teachers unions have found cause to regret that choice, as they have often disagreed with accountability-focused, charter-friendly Obama.\n\nAnd Clinton seems to be the defender of traditional public schools that the unions have been longing to install in the White House: She was pushing for universal pre-K long before it was part of the national political conversation. Then again, she\u2019s also spoken favorably of charters and has never exactly come out swinging against tying test scores to teacher performance. (In the 2008 election, as this New York Times story pointed out, it wasn\u2019t necessary to take a position on these now incredibly contentious issues.)\n\nStill, if it was all but inevitable that the teachers unions would endorse Clinton, why\u2019d the AFT pull the trigger so early? The timing of the endorsement has attracted as much attention as its content. Last time, the AFT didn\u2019t endorse Clinton until October 2007, and in recent months Richard Trumka, the president of the AFL-CIO, has been urging unions not to endorse candidates until they know more about their economic positions. The obvious answer is that the Clinton camp choreographed the AFT endorsement as a safeguard against the unexpected threat posed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2014a candidate, incidentally, that unions seem to like so much that earlier this month Trumka had to remind state and local leaders that they weren\u2019t allowed to endorse Sanders without his say-so. (Disclosure: The Sanders campaign and the AFT are both clients of the digital communications company where my husband works.)\n\nThe same Sanders supporters objected to the AFT endorsement, as the 2,300+ enraged comments on the AFT\u2019s Facebook page indicates (\u201cCan I get my Union dues back because you are not supporting the best candidate. FEEL THE BERN!!!!!!!!!\u201d). As of Monday afternoon, a Change.org petition addressed to the AFT titled \u201cWithdraw your Endorsement of Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Presidential Nomination!\u201d had garnered 3,400 signatures. The most popular comment, from James Swatzel in Redlands, California, conveys the general sentiment of signatories:\n\nI am a concerned union member and former union president. Hillary is for the 1%. Sanders is for the rest of us. Sanders is much more pro-union. Look at both of their big campaign contributors. Sanders, mostly unions. Clinton, mostly banks.\n\nOver the course of the weekend, Weingarten has acknowledged the online kerfuffle on her Twitter page with upbeat comments like, \u201cI appreciate those voicing concerns. Many strongly favor other candidates, but we saw consistently that ~2/3 majority support Hillary\u201d and \u201cI love the activism\u2014including members who oppose our endorsement\u2014we value every time members raise their voice.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:13:52.455+0000"}
{"entityId": 491, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is officially launching his Republican presidential primary campaign Monday with lots of reasons to be happy. Walker is considered one of the potential favorites in a field with no clear front-runner and is a personal darling of powerful conservative voices, such as influential donors David and Charles Koch. Walker also starts the race with an early advantage in the first-in-the-nation caucuses of Iowa, where recent polls have him up on his nearest challengers by 8 and 6 points, respectively.\n\nWhile Iowa Republicans might be excited by the prospect of a Walker presidency, there\u2019s a nearby state where people are less fond of Walker: Wisconsin. The latest job approval numbers on Walker out of his state had him at a pitiful 41 percent in a pair of April polls. His disapproval number in one poll by St. Norbert College, Wisconsin Public Radio, and Wisconsin Public Television was 58 percent, and in the same poll 59 percent of Wisconsin adults didn\u2019t even want him to run for president. In that survey a full 60 percent of respondents said he would make a \u201cpoor\u201d or \u201cnot so good\u201d president, including 44 percent who went with the former.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat survey bore out the results of a similar one conducted around the same time by Marquette Law School, which found that 56 percent of registered Wisconsin voters disapproved of the job he was doing as governor and 53 percent said the state was on the \u201cwrong track.\u201d\n\nThe point is that\u2014however he does in the rest of the country\u2014a Walker nomination is not likely to turn Wisconsin red for the first time since 1984. Republicans had hoped that having Rep. Paul Ryan on the presidential ticket in 2012 might boost their chances in the state, but they ended up losing by a full 7 points. Having Walker on the ticket would not likely offer an improvement. If anything, it could hurt the party in the Badger State.\n\nWalker boosters like to tout the fact that he has won not two but three gubernatorial campaigns in the last five years while pushing staunchly conservative policies in a firmly blue state. But each of those three wins, including his victory in 2012\u2019s recall election, came from smaller and more Republican electorates than you get in national votes in Wisconsin. The 57.8 percent who turned out for Walker\u2019s June recall campaign was the largest number in a state gubernatorial race in at least the last 64 years. But even that mark was dwarfed by the number of Wisconsinites who voted in the 2012 presidential election, when the state saw more than 70 percent of voters turn out\u2014the second-highest number in the entire country.\n\nThat turnout number is a fairly consistent one for Wisconsin in recent national elections, and those national electorates have been far friendlier to Democrats. Judging by the unpopularity of Walker\u2019s policies in the state, hitting that 70 percent turnout number might not even be necessary for a Democratic opponent to defeat a hypothetical Walker candidacy in Wisconsin in 2016. As the Washington Post reported Monday, Walker has been criticized by both state Democrats and Republicans for supporting $250 million in taxpayer funding for a new stadium for the Milwaukee Bucks, a stance similar to one that was opposed by 79 percent of Wisconsin voters in April\u2019s Marquette poll. At the same time, Walker has slashed education spending in his newly signed state budget with $250 million in cuts to the University of Wisconsin. In the Marquette poll, 70 percent of Wisconsin voters opposed $300 million in proposed cuts to the university system, while 78 percent opposed Walker\u2019s then-proposed cuts to the K\u201312 school budget.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:13:53.432+0000"}

Wade is that it might have served women better to wait longer for reproductive rights\u2014that the nation simply wasn\u2019t ready for it. When the Supreme Court decided Roe in 1973, this line of thinking goes, it inadvertently spawned a startlingly successful anti-abortion backlash and a vitriolic culture war that we still haven\u2019t escaped 40-plus years later.\n\nBut legal historian Mary Ziegler argues that we overestimate Roe\u2019s hold on our current abortion politics. Her new book, After Roe, which looks at dozens of key players in the pro-life and abortion rights camps of the 1970s and \u201980s, shows that it took a lot more than a single Supreme Court decision to polarize the nation and sour our public conversation about abortion. What\u2019s more, according to Ziegler, it didn\u2019t have to be this way. There were\u2014and maybe still are\u2014opportunities for civility and collaboration, as Ziegler explains in this interview, which has been condensed and edited.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSlate: Why did you decide to write this book?\n\nMary Ziegler: A lot of law classes deal with the question of whether you can use law to change society\u2014which is really important now, especially as we come to what might be the end of the struggle for marriage equality. The questions are: Is this the right move? Has it worked in the past?\n\nRoe is always the cautionary tale. If you\u2019re fighting for equality for transgender individuals or whomever, people will hold up Roe and say, \u201cWell, going through the courts might not be such a good idea.\u201d But no one had actually studied how much Roe did. The warnings about social change through courts that come from Roe are mostly myths. People think that the Supreme Court bestowed this upon us, but the reality was really messy.\n\nYour book dives into the history of the anti-abortion movement\u2019s \u201cincrementalist\u201d legal strategy of chipping away at abortion rights.\n\nIncrementalism means that instead of directly asking for the recognition of fetal rights or outright bans on abortion, you argue that a lot of restrictions are actually compatible with Roe. The newest generation of restrictions is a little bolder, but it\u2019s an extension of a larger, long-term incrementalist strategy.\n\nThe pro-life side wanted to be the next civil rights movement.\n\nFor most contemporary observers, incrementalism kind of seems inevitable. Actually, it took a long time for abortion opponents to turn to incrementalism, and it\u2019s still very controversial [within the movement]. In the past few years, the movement for personhood amendments to state constitutions has been a mutiny in the ranks of pro-lifers who think that incrementalism is weak, a compromise.\n\nWhen incrementalism developed, it was really because anti-abortion activists couldn\u2019t get what they wanted: a constitutional amendment that recognized a right to life. Only when they thought they couldn\u2019t overturn Roe did they turn to something else.\n\nWhat most surprised you in researching the book?\n\nMany anti-abortion activists in the \u201970s didn\u2019t believe that they were legal or political conservatives. When they were first talking about fetal rights, they thought unborn children were the next logical minority. They would talk about illegitimate children and unwed mothers and cite constitutional law doctrines associated with the left, not the right.

Walker made restricting abortion access a major priority of his administration, signing a law requiring abortion providers to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital\u2014a standard ruse that exploits fears about women's safety as a front to eliminate legal abortion.

Just in case anyone thought Trump had backed off of that, he reinforced his skepticism over Obama's citizenship in a CNN interview on Thursday.\n\nTrump's birtherism was reportedly one of the reasons Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake found it distasteful that the Maricopa County Republicans were hosting Saturday's rally. When Flake appealed to the party this week to reconsider its involvement, the county chairmain responded that he was \"thrilled\" Trump was coming and scolded Flake for violating the Reagan rule that \"thou shall not speak ill of any other Republican.\"\n\nFlake's opposition aside, Arizona is full of pro-Trump Republicans, including former governor Jan Brewer, who presided over the passage of the state's notorious SB 1070 immigration law.

John Kasich, the popular two-term Ohio governor who has been dismissed as a Jon Huntsman-like moderate afterthought, might actually do more damage to mainstream Republicans than Trump. While Trump\u2019s caustic comments about immigrants may leave Republicans with a general election hangover, it\u2019s Kasich\u2019s more nuanced views of reform that could spell bigger headaches for the establishment favorites.\n\nKasich, of course, has to make it on the debate stage first. He currently sits three places and about two points away from snagging the 10th and final invite to a primetime event that will take place in his own backyard. But there are plenty of reasons to believe Kasich is due for a surge. For starters, he\u2019ll most likely get a bump after he makes his campaign official on July 21, a burst that doesn\u2019t have to be lasting or large to be meaningful since Fox News will send out debate invites two weeks later. Meanwhile, the three candidates he\u2019ll probably need to pass have largely stalled: Carly Fiorina is short on cash, Rick Santorum is short on fans, and Chris Christie\u2019s bid appears to have come four years and one traffic jam too late. Add to that the boost Kasich will get from the $1 million statewide ad blitz that his allies recently launched on his behalf in New Hampshire and the former House budget chairman is a decent bet to be on stage when the curtain rises.\n\nAnd if that happens? Well, then what promises to be a circus may have some unexpected substance to go along with it. All eyes will still be on Trump, of course, but it\u2019d be Kasich who could make things truly uncomfortable for Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and the rest of the mainstream candidates who are trying to appeal to the disaffected white working-class voters they\u2019ll need to win the GOP nomination while still not completely alienating Latino and moderate voters ahead of the general election.\n\nConsider what will happen when Trump trots out some version of his xenophobic and incendiary comments about many Mexican immigrants being rapists and criminals on the debate stage: Bush and Rubio can score a few easy points by simply admonishing him and moving on. In the process, they\u2019d come off looking responsible and compassionate\u2014who isn\u2019t compared to Trump?\u2014while not having to actually talk about specifics that divide the base.

Some of the austerity measures it includes may actually be more severe than the ones Greeks shot down at the polls.\n\nJordan Weissmann Jordan Weissmann is Slate's senior business and economics correspondent.\n\nAnd what does Greece get in return? Instead of the five-month, \u20ac15.5 billion agreement that had been on the table, Athens wants \u20ac53.5 billion worth of loans lasting three years, which would lock in a little stability going forward. Perhaps more importantly, the government is seeking to further restructure its existing loans\u2014which is completely reasonable.

Meanwhile, German Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble delivered an especially cryptic and discouraging pronouncement on Thursday, saying that Greece's debt was both too large and that the European Union probably couldn't forgive any of it. \"Debt sustainability is not feasible without a haircut and I think the IMF is correct in saying that,\" he told a conference in Frankfurt before adding, \"There cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union.\" Does that mean any sort of an agreement is now impossible in German eyes?

All too often some incident reminds us of our murderous racial past and the hatred that has lingered for decades. Most recently we glimpsed this hatred in the church massacre in Charleston, South Carolina, but before that we saw it in the demonstrations in Baltimore, in the aftermath of the shooting of Walter Scott, the murder of Tamir Rice. Similar moments fill our news pages and television screens so regularly that the death of black people has become a kind of brutal heartbeat in our country.\n\nEven when one of these moments of brutality takes place outside the states of the old Confederacy, like the murder of Michael Brown in Missouri, the shadow of renewed bigotry falls over the capitals and courthouses of the South, the place that our country sees\u2014that has in fact earned its place\u2014as the headquarters for racial hatred and white supremacy in America.\n\nBy the time you read this there may well be another such moment filling our newspapers and airwaves and laptop screens. It is inevitable that somewhere another black man will die in circumstances that look too much like a lynching to be ignored, and, because these acts now horrify us, we will move through the same stages of national hand-wringing as before. Once again we will hear pundits discuss the problem of race, which in our country is seen, whether rightly or wrongly, as a crisis native to the South.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nI grew up confident, Caucasian, capitalist, in a 1960s South. In the South I knew, white people dictated the way that black people could live, where they could shop, what water fountains they could drink out of, and what bathrooms they could use. They were, after all, descended from savages, barely able to survive in the white man\u2019s shadow. To my child\u2019s mind, this was simply the way the world worked. The South is where I have lived all my life. Its history weighs on me more as I age and am able to see it more clearly, stripped of romance and myths of chivalry and charm. Stripped of confused nostalgia.\n\nIt is an inescapable truth that in the South the past is too much with us, late and soon, a statement that conflates two famous Williams, Faulkner and Wordsworth. In the Wordsworth poem, it is the world that is too much with us, as getting and spending we lay waste our powers. The quote is apt in that our old ways of getting and spending included a trade in human beings. In the South, slavery is the source of the evil that clings to the region, past and present, and as time goes by all other visions of yesterday are fading away. But still there are too many who have enshrined a different image of history, finding glory where none ever existed, then or now. And so to paraphrase Faulkner, in the South, the past has never lost its stranglehold on the present.\n\nIn the South we are doomed by history, especially by our failures, but we define these failures to our own advantage. We lost the war; we fell out of the golden age. We endured the humiliation of armed occupation. This is the lost cause of the South which white people talk about, and for a long time this was the only South that mattered to any of us. The South was a strange land where a bitter rebellion came and went, deeply painful for all sides. The conduct of the war and pain of those brief years overshadowed the reasons for the war, what it sprang from and what it meant. For decades white Southerners lived in the bitterness of that loss, until gradually it morphed into a victory of the spirit, and took on a kind of golden glow.\n\nBut what that glow disguised was the ever-deepening divide among both the races and among the classes within those races, as the poorer whites watched with increasing anger as the descendents of former slaves rose in the societal ranks, becoming successful in the very highest levels, with someone who looked like them even audaciously becoming president of the United States.

When Justice Anthony Kennedy declared a constitutional right to same-sex marriage in Obergefell v. Hodges on June 26, each of the court\u2019s other four Republican appointees wrote a separate dissent taking a swipe at him. (The court\u2019s four Democrats stayed mum, content to let Kennedy make the case and take the heat.) Aiming all their firepower at Kennedy, the dissenters missed their real target: the Constitution itself. While persuasively explaining why they could not join Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion, they failed to persuasively explain why they voted against the constitutional claims at issue\u2014why they were dissenting (\u201cKennedy has reached the wrong result\u201d) rather than concurring in the judgment (\u201cKennedy has reached the right result but for the wrong reasons\u201d). Indeed, the four dissenters failed even to identify, much less engage, the best constitutional arguments for same-sex marriage\u2014arguments that have been repeatedly made over many years by many leading lawyers, scholars, and lower-court judges.\n\nJustice Kennedy\u2019s majority opinion is not perfect, but it reached the right result, and for many of the right reasons. To be clear: Kennedy is not just right morally and not just right politically. He is not only on the right side of history\u2014duh!\u2014but also on the right side of the law, based on the Constitution\u2019s letter and spirit and original meaning, as properly construed and implemented by the court in many previous cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nHad I been whispering in Kennedy\u2019s ear, here is the opinion I would have urged him to write:\n\nWe begin, as is altogether fitting and proper, with the Constitution itself. The 14th Amendment opens with a promise of birth equality: \u201cAll persons born ... in the United Sates ... are citizens\u201d and thus equal citizens. As full and equal citizens, all persons born in America are entitled to full and equal protection of all fundamental civil liberties, as expressly guaranteed by the very next sentence of the 14th Amendment: \u201cNo State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.\u201d\n\nThe 14th Amendment\u2019s opening words about birthright citizenship were a clear and conscious codification of Abraham Lincoln\u2019s vision at Gettysburg: America is dedicated to the proposition that all are created equal\u2014\u201cborn\u201d equal, in the language of the amendment. Persons born black are equal in civil rights to those born white. Persons born male are equal in civil rights to those born female. Persons born out of wedlock are equal in civil rights to those born in wedlock. Those born into Irish American families are equal to Anglo Americans and Italian Americans. Those born into Jewish households are legally the same as those born into Catholic or Protestant households. Children born second or third or 10th in a family are in law no less than those born first\u2014the amendment prohibits once-common primogeniture and entail laws favoring first-born children as such. And today we make clear that those born gay or lesbian are no less in civil rights than those born straight.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was surely about racial equality\u2014the core case of birth equality\u2014but it just as surely ranged beyond race. The text speaks more generally than race\u2014in pointed and purposeful contrast to the race-specific language of the 15th Amendment that followed shortly thereafter. (That amendment, of course, was necessary, as was the later 19th Amendment, because the 14th Amendment\u2019s opening words applied only to \u201ccivil rights\u201d and not to \u201cpolitical rights\u201d such as voting, as this court correctly made clear early on in our 1875 ruling in Minor v. Happersett. For more documentation and analysis, see Akhil Amar, The Law of the Land, pp. 115-19; Akhil Amar, America\u2019s Unwritten Constitution, pp. 156-61, 186-87, and sources cited therein.)\n\nThe birth-equality principle was expressly and emphatically articulated in a landmark statute adopted alongside the 14th Amendment\u2014by the very same Congress in the very same season and by virtually the same vote. This companion statute, the Civil Rights Act of 1866, opened with language virtually identical to the first sentence of the 14th Amendment and then immediately glossed that language by proclaiming that all birthright citizens were entitled to \u201cthe full and equal\u201d benefit of all fundamental civil rights. This birth-equality idea was also expressly articulated by the first Justice Harlan\u2014the great dissenter in Plessy\u2014in our 1896 decision in Gibson v. Mississippi where, happily, he spoke for the court as a whole: \u201cAll citizens are equal before the law.\u201d\n\nThis simple yet profound birth-equality principle powerfully organizes and unifies a vast amount of this court\u2019s case law in the modern era, which treats certain legal distinctions as particularly problematic\u2014laws discriminating on the basis of race, sex, ethnicity, or illegitimacy. By contrast, laws that distinguish along most other dimensions\u2014treating wage income differently than rental income; treating opticians differently than ophthalmologists; treating small employers differently than large employers, and so on\u2014are not viewed with the same kind of skepticism.\n\nSome think that the 14th Amendment\u2019s framers were not clearly focused on sex discrimination or the related issue of women\u2019s civil rights. Wrong. In fact, much of the key language of the amendment\u2019s first section tracked a proposal put forth earlier by none other than Elizabeth Cady Stanton. (For details see Akhil Amar, The Bill of Rights: Creation and Reconstruction pp.260-61 and sources cited therein.) The 14th Amendment\u2019s framers thus knew exactly what they were doing in pitching its text at the proper level of generality, condemning not just racially discriminatory laws but all laws creating unequal civil rights on the basis of birth status. This birth-equality principle resonated with Enlightenment ideology and the original Constitution\u2019s paired clauses banning both state and federal governments from creating titles of nobility (laws that privileged certain persons by dint of their birth).\n\nNot all laws that distinguish on the basis of birth status are unconstitutional. Some distinctions may be justifiable if genuinely and unavoidably necessary to prevent harm to others. For example, although some persons are born blind, the law may generally prohibit blind persons from flying airplanes; persons born with the HIV virus may be legally prohibited from donating blood; and so on. But judges must carefully scrutinize all such laws to ensure that they do not create an improper caste-like system in which some are legally demeaned and degraded while others or legally honored and exalted merely on the basis of birth status.\n\nLaws that allow straights to marry while denying this basic marriage privilege to gays and lesbians violate this deep and pure 14th Amendment principle. These laws improperly demean our fellow citizens who happen to have been born gay or lesbian and improperly exalt our fellow citizens who happen to have been born straight. True, these laws technically and formally do not hinge on a person\u2019s orientation. Even a man born gay is allowed to marry. So long, that is, as he marries a woman! Cf. Joseph Heller, Catch 22. But \u201claw reaches past formalism.\u201d Lee v. Weisman (1992) (Kennedy, J.). Sexual intimacy is part of the core of marriage as a legal and social institution, and denial of same-sex marriage does indeed deprive gays and lesbians of the full and equal enjoyment of this intimacy\u2014a full and equal opportunity for \u201cthe pursuit of happiness\u201d that underlies the American project.\n\nWe concede that some persons may experience some or all aspects of their sexual orientation as a matter of pure choice. Nevertheless, a vast number of our fellow citizens do in fact understand themselves to be, quite simply, \u201cborn this way\u201d in regard to their sexual orientation, and we are in no position to hold that these very widespread self-understandings are inauthentic or delusional. Even if it were conclusively proved at some future point that orientation is typically fixed not at birth but rather very early in childhood, the deep spirit of the birth-equality principle would still apply. Citizens should not be demeaned on the basis of harmless and morally irrelevant traits that they never chose and are not free to change with ease. That is the animating spirit\u2014the underlying logic\u2014of the birth-equality rule.\n\nReligious equality principles are also indirectly relevant here. Even though religion is often chosen rather than fixed at birth, our Constitution allows persons to choose their religion freely and equally. Religion for many is central to identity and so is sexual orientation.\n\nWhy, then, did the framers of the 14th Amendment allow discriminatory marriage laws to continue on the books? In large part because they did not know all the facts, scientific and social, that we now know. They did not know that many persons experience sexual orientation as fixed, not chosen. They did not live in a world in which vast numbers of gays and lesbians openly challenged marriage exclusion as a fundamental badge of inequality and degradation.\n\nSimilarly, many of the 14th Amendment\u2019s framers thought racial segregation was acceptable because racial separation might genuinely be equal. If most blacks and most whites genuinely preferred segregation, then where was the improper demeaning of one race or the improper exaltation of another? Separate could truly be equal under certain factual assumptions in the 1860s (just as today, separate bathrooms and sports teams for males and females are generally seen as equal by both males and females). But once it became clear, in the decades after the enactment of the 14th Amendment, that vast numbers of blacks did object to racial separation, this changed social fact itself was a proper basis for declaring racial segregation unconstitutional. See Plessy v. Ferguson (Harlan, J. dissenting); Brown v. Board (Warren, C.J.).\n\nA similar story may be told about sex discrimination\u2014discrimination between men and women\u2014within marriage laws. The Framers of the 14th Amendment quite clearly did believe in sex equality in civil rights: within this domain, these Framers believed that women should not be demeaned nor men exalted because of their differential birth status. In the 1860s, marriage laws\u2014and many other laws\u2014created differentiated legal roles for men and women, but these differentiated legal roles were in that era not widely understood as ennobling men or degrading women. Both genders were highly esteemed, but they played different legal roles. Separate roles, distinct roles, but not unequal roles. Women themselves were not en masse demanding an end to coverture laws in the 1860s. And so these laws were widely seen as permissible in the 1860s by the Framers of the 14th Amendment. But when later generations of women did en masse come to demand a change\u2014and to highlight that these laws now did indeed appear demeaning to them and improperly ennobling of men\u2014judges in the mid-20th century rightly struck down these gendered marriage laws.\n\nWe do the same today and for the same reason. Indeed, the laws at issue today do, formally, discriminate on the basis of sex. Under these laws, Pat can marry Jane only if Pat is male (Patrick) and not female (Patricia). This is sex-discrimination pure and simple, and under our longstanding sex-discrimination case law\u2014case law deeply rooted in the text and spirit of the 14th Amendment, as we have just explained\u2014this sex discrimination regime must survive the most exacting judicial scrutiny. We hold today that this regime fails this scrutiny. These sex-discriminatory laws are an improper attempt to enforce a rigid and unequal gender code, telling men that they must not act in effeminate (\u201csissy\u201d) ways and women that must not behave in a masculine (\u201cbutch\u201d) manner. Such laws are a violation of genuine sex equality and also of liberty\u2014the liberty of each person, male or female (or neither or both), to be free to be true to himself/herself//oneself.\n\nTo put this point about the deep connection between equality and freedom a different way\u2014and to explain from yet another angle why we now must vindicate the enacted letter and spirit of the 14th Amendment without being hamstrung by every specific nontextual and unratified factual or normative assumption that its Framers may have held\u2014we today take judicial notice of the following basic and widespread facts of our modern world. Sexual intimacy and human procreation have been profoundly decoupled in the last half-century. Persons can have babies without having sex (IVF) and can have sex without having babies (contraception). Marriage law itself has become gender-neutral, undercutting several of the basic premises of earlier regimes that structured marriage in deeply gendered ways. Gender itself has been scientifically transformed. Legally and factually, men can now become women and women can now become men. If Patrick, who is married to Jane, undergoes medical and/or legal gender reassignment and becomes Patricia, Pat is the same human being on both sides of this medical and/or legal procedure. And after the gender transition occurs, Pat and Jane remain married. This is already a same-sex marriage, in virtually every state! No jurisdiction has been brought to our attention that treats Pat\u2019s medical transformation as ipso facto dissolving the marriage\u2014as does, for example, death. Pat is Pat regardless of what is between Pat\u2019s legs or what was once between them on the day that Pat was born, and regardless of what gender designation appears on Pat\u2019s birth certificate or driver\u2019s license or passport. Our fundamental nature is not male or female, black or white, but human, pure and simple. Our most basic law must recognize these basic facts of modern life, modern law, and modern science.\n\nThere are obvious similarities between Justice Kennedy\u2019s actual majority opinion and my alternative. My opinion and his both rely squarely on the 14th Amendment\u2019s vision. We both invoke liberty and equality and try to highlight ways in which these principles at times intertwine. We both treat sexual orientation as analogous to race in certain ways. (Kennedy does this by appealing at every turn to the 1967 case of Loving v. Virginia, involving interracial marriage, and by twice explicitly suggesting that sexual orientation is \u201cimmutable.\u201d I do so by stressing the 14th Amendment idea of birth equality.) We both candidly confront the fact that the 14th Amendment\u2019s Framers did not understand that its words would doom bans of same-sex marriage. In doing so, we both point to the significance of changed gender rules within marriage\u2014for example, the demise of coverture laws that once gave husbands more power than wives in certain key respects.\n\nBut I like my version better. I root my opinion in the solid text of the 14th Amendment\u2019s promises of birthright citizenship and the privileges and immunities of citizenship, which include both substantive rights and equality rights. Also, I make a number of knockdown historical points about the Framers of the amendment and the companion Civil Rights Act of 1866. Kennedy does not play these or any other persuasive originalist notes and puts most of his weight on the textually inapt Due Process Clause. That clause speaks plainly of procedural rights (fair trials, unbiased judges, and the like) as distinct from substantive rights (such as the right to marry). Kennedy, a libertarian, stresses the word liberty in the Due Process Clause, but this liberty has historically been closely linked to negative rights (freedom from government) rather than affirmative rights (freedom to insist on government-recognized benefits such as marriage laws). Kennedy does not make crystal clear the distinction between applying the 14th Amendment\u2019s Framers\u2019 actual and enacted principles to new scientific and social and legal facts, on the one hand, and simply substituting newfangled principles of his own creation, on the other. Kennedy does not treat same-sex marriage bans as simple sex-discrimination laws, nor does he discuss the reality of gender-reassignment in modern America. He offers no overarching way of bringing unity to the court\u2019s treatment of certain kinds of discriminations as particularly invidious. My parsimonious account not only makes sense of the cases as a whole, but powerfully connects them to core principles of constitutional text, history, and structure.\n\nAt several points in his opinion, Kennedy takes pains to limit the right to marry to two-person marriages, but he offers no real reason why. My argument cleanly distinguishes same-sex marriage from polygamy. Anti-polygamy laws do not discriminate on the basis of birth status. They do not treat Patrick differently than Patricia, nor do they treat those born gay differently than those born straight. No strong evidence has yet been presented to suggest that a vast number of persons are in fact born polygamous or become polygamous in early childhood and without conscious choice. No broad social movement has arisen in America to insist, authentically, that polygamists were \u201cborn this way\u201d and have no real choice in the matter. The distinction between a legally sanctioned two-person institution and a legally unsanctioned three-person arrangement is just like many other generally unproblematic distinctions throughout our law. Tax laws allow different sorts of commuting cost deductions, depending on whether a person has one employer or two or more employers; discrimination laws treat firms with 14 employees differently from those with 15; and so on.\n\nStill, Kennedy got the right answer. The dissenters did not, and they did not even ask the right questions. Chief Justice John Roberts himself asked a version of the Patrick/Patricia question at oral argument but then proceeded to utterly ignore this issue in his opinion\u2014as did all the other dissenters in their separate opinions. But the dissenters cannot properly do this if they wish to rule against same-sex marriage. Even if Kennedy didn\u2019t squarely rely on this approach, the litigants and amici did make this argument, and so have many other thoughtful scholars and judges. America is entitled to know why this argument is not a proper alternative basis for Kennedy\u2019s judgment. And although Kennedy himself did not use magic words such as \u201cstrict scrutiny,\u201d his repeated emphasis on the immutability of sexual orientation and the long history of anti-gay discrimination surely required that a persuasive dissent confront the claim that laws discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation demand heightened judicial scrutiny. Once again, this was an issue at the very heart of the case at hand and any justice ruling against the gay and lesbian litigants at hand owed America a careful explanation why heightened scrutiny was inappropriate under the unifying logic of a very long line of landmark precedents involving race and sex discrimination and discrimination against illegitimate children. But Chief Justice Roberts\u2019 dissent never explained why heightened scrutiny was unwarranted.\n\nSo, too, America is entitled to know how a proper federal system will work if a marriage that is fully valid in the state where it was held fades in and out, legally, as persons cross state lines\u2014perhaps as part of their federal responsibilities, if, for example, they are in the military and sent to a different base or are travelling to the national capital to petition Congress. Kennedy did not need to address these arguments because he was giving the plaintiffs everything they asked for without having to reach the interstate issues. But these issues were squarely before the court, and the dissenters simply ignored them, proceeding to vote against the actual citizens before the court in the case at hand without answering all their plausible legal claims. This is judicial minimalism with a vengeance.\n\nThe chief justice repeatedly invoked principles of judicial deference but failed to explain clearly why these principles did not apply with equal or greater force in previous landmark cases in which he voted to invalidate an iconic Voting Rights Act and voted to undo congressional limits on campaign contributions (which are decisively different from purely expressive independent activities such as running political ads on one\u2019s own).\n\nJustice Antonin Scalia\u2019s dissent insisted that the fact that the Framers of the 14th Amendment accepted bans on same-sex marriage was utterly dispositive. He claimed that this fact alone \u201cresolves these cases.\u201d But why then are coverture laws, which these same amenders also found proper, unconstitutional? What about the fact that many amenders found segregation and anti-miscegenation laws acceptable? Should this fact alone have resolved Brown v. Board and Loving v. Virginia in favor of segregationists and anti-miscegnationists? No answer from the good justice.\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas persuasively argued that it was a stretch to say that the Due Process Clause was violated. There was not a clear violation of negative liberty, nor was there any obvious procedural lapse in the laws at issue. But what about the 14th Amendment\u2019s birthright citizenship clause and its companion guarantee of full and equal privileges and immunities of citizenship\u2014clauses that Thomas himself has powerfully highlighted and championed in other cases? Once again, silence.\n\nFinally, Justice Samuel Alito was highly persuasive in reminding us that the anti-same-sex-marriage laws at issue were hardly irrational. Following tradition is often quite rational, and every reform is likely to have unintended consequences. Not all of these consequences may be apparent immediately. Same-sex marriage is an experiment, and the jury is still out. Fair enough. But once again, the same could have been said about coverture laws in 1970, and Alito\u2019s arguments merely explain why the laws at hand are rational. What he failed to explain is why mere rationality was enough\u2014why these discriminatory laws should not be treated with special judicial skepticism as are many other traditional gender laws. Laws that discriminated against illegitimate children were not irrational; they arguably incentivized the biological parents to marry; and some of these laws had deep historical roots. Yet the court rightly invalidated these laws as violative of the birth-equality principle. Jim Crow was a pretty strong tradition in 1954. But Brown was nevertheless clearly right\u2014and so is Obergefell.\n\nRead more of Slate\u2019s coverage of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:15:54.048+0000"}

But as I lurched past the screaming crowd on a parade float, looking into the faces of the out-and-proud, I couldn\u2019t help feeling a pang of sadness for the people who were missing. For every Proud Mary waving a rainbow flag with his clique of queer friends, there\u2019s still a kid lingering alone in the closet somewhere, unsure how to get out. So, in the inclusive spirit that makes Pride so powerful, I\u2019m reaching out to that kid. At the beginning of a new era, I\u2019m writing a letter to a young homo.\n\nDear Young Homo,\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWalking down the street feels better than it did a week ago. People still suck their teeth at me when I wear heels, carry a man-purse, or hold my partner\u2019s hand. But when they do, I can laugh, \u201cMy way of life is the law now, honey.\u201d The highest court in the land has acknowledged us\u2014not approved of us, per se, but at least accepted that we\u2019re people and that we\u2019re here to stay. Young Homo, the world you\u2019re coming out into is much better than the world I faced at your age, and it improves every day. So what\u2019s holding you back?\n\nMaybe you\u2019re stuck because you\u2019re not sure how to start being queer. Don\u2019t worry, that\u2019s completely normal. A teacher friend of mine recently called with a half-heartbreaking, half-hilarious story about one of her students who forced himself to wear bright yellow spandex booty shorts because he thought that gays are required to dress loudly. The experiment ended with this poor kid literally hiding in the closet at school, feeling utterly lost because he knew he didn\u2019t like women, but he didn\u2019t seem to like \u201cgay\u201d clothes either. This is when my teacher friend explained something very important: There are no secret requirements for gayness, there is no dress code. You can wear exactly what you\u2019re wearing now, use the same voice you\u2019re using now, watch the same television shows, and still be gay as a Norwegian summer day is long. You define your queerness, not the other way around.\n\nOr maybe you\u2019re afraid of what people will say as you struggle to figure out who you are. Well, yes, I can promise that you will be mocked for fumbling around as you search for yourself. Even the glamorous and groundbreaking Caitlyn Jenner has been subject to this kind of criticism from commentators, columnists, and gays on the street alike. Just last weekend I overheard a group of gay brunchers condemning Jenner for changing her mind too often, for being unclear about how she wants to complete and present her transition. \u201cShe keeps contradicting herself,\u201d one gay said, \u201cSo you can tell she\u2019s just doing it for publicity.\u201d Young Homo, I know you want to look confident, decisive, and adult as you come out, so that people will take you seriously. But it\u2019s not your job to impress onlookers. It\u2019s not your job to become yourself neatly, to vault clear of hetero life and stick a perfect landing in queerdom. Allow yourself to be a confused mess, as we all are\u2014and forget the howls from the sidelines.\n\nBut maybe more frightening obstacles are preventing you from coming out. Perhaps you know that you will face hatred or even violence at home, at school, or on the streets of your town if you reveal yourself\u2014and that becoming yourself will mean losing loved ones, or leaving behind the only home you\u2019ve known. I am afraid that these kinds of challenges are still common for LGBTQ people, and that when you find a network of queer friends, you\u2019ll meet many people who understand what you\u2019ve been through. If these are the kind of troubles that lay before you, I can only say one thing: Coming out is about something larger than you.\n\nBecause the bottom line is that you are needed in the LGBTQ community. During the New York City\u2019s Pride March, I was struck by the diversity among us. Under our rainbow banner, there are not only lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning groups, but individuals drifting back and forth between them\u2014individuals defying category, individuals awaiting definition. And many of these people are struggling with injustices that the Supreme Court decision has left untouched. Young Homo, now that the LGBTQ world has its foot through the door, we\u2019re going to need every ally we can get. If you\u2019re in the closet at home, you\u2019re not only missing out on a pivotal moment in gay rights, you\u2019re missing out on your chance to contribute to the next steps. Gays can still be fired for being gay in many states, and the housing rights of transgender people are widely violated, and other problems too numerous to mention still plague us.\n\nI know this is a terrifying time. As I think about what you must be going through, memories from my own coming-out process are surfacing. Once, in ninth grade, a truck load of college boys heckled at me as I walked to my bus stop. \u201cFaggot!\u201d they roared, and launched an empty beer bottle at my head. All that morning, I wondered if I really could be what those boys had called me. I remember telling myself, over and over, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have any desire to put on women\u2019s clothing, so how could I be gay?\u201d Oh, if I could tear a hole through time and appear in drag before my young self, all that boy\u2019s bargaining, hedging, and hoping would come apart, Gordian Knot style, and he would be able to launch his life!*\n\nBut since I can\u2019t write to my young self, I\u2019m writing to you. Young Homo, come out.\n\nxoxo,\n\nMiz Cracker", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:16:29.364+0000"}

Combined with the Supreme Court\u2019s unwillingness to tackle the abortion issue, women have vastly varying abortion access from state to state.\n\nNew legislation introduced in Congress this week signals a pushback from Democrats. Representatives Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), and Diana DeGette (D-Colo.) have introduced the Equal Access to Abortion Coverage in Health Insurance Act, or the EACH Woman Act. According to RH Reality Check, the EACH Woman Act \u201cwould ensure that anyone who has health care or health insurance through the federal government also has coverage of abortion care.\u201d While the bill has 70 co-sponsors, it\u2019s unlikely to pass in a Republican-controlled House.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe bill would prohibit states from restricting insurance coverage of abortion, which is currently allowed by the Affordable Care Act. Significantly, 25 states currently have laws in place that do not allow private insurers to cover abortion.\n\nThis legislation is a direct challenge to the Hyde amendment, which Congress passed in 1976, only three years after Roe v. Wade. Although the amendment has changed slightly over the years, the ACLU reports, the \u201cfederal Medicaid program mandates abortion funding [only] in cases of rape or incest, as well as when a pregnant woman's life is endangered by a physical disorder, illness, or injury.\u201d\n\nRep. Henry Hyde originally said of the bill, \u201cI would certainly like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion: a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman.\u201d\n\nBut his legislation has disproportionately affected lower-income women and women of color. As the report by the Center for American Progress explains, \u201cwomen of color are more likely to rely on government health programs,\u201d while the Guttmacher Institute found that \u201capproximately one-fourth of women who would have Medicaid-funded abortions instead give birth when this funding is unavailable.\u201d\n\nIn 1980, the Supreme Court heard a challenge to the amendment in Harris v. McRae but ultimately upheld it. Justice Thurgood Marshall wrote in his dissent that it was \u201cdesigned to deprive poor and minority women of the constitutional right to choose abortion. That purpose is not constitutionally permitted under Roe v. Wade.\u201d\n\nRH Reality Check itemizes the would-be impact of the bill. It \u201cwould affect millions of women who receive health coverage through the federal government, including the one in six women who are enrolled in Medicaid; about one million female federal employees; women in the military or in the Peace Corps; young women under age 19 who are insured through the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP); Native American women covered under Indian Health Services; and women covered under these programs through a spouse or a parent.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:16:37.877+0000"}

Donald Trump is following the opposite strategy. There\u2019s no fracas he won\u2019t join. When he\u2019s not defending his characterization of Mexican immigrants as rapists and murderers, he\u2019s exchanging charges of racism with op-ed writers, slagging his opponents, and launching counterstrikes against companies who abandon him. When there were reports that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called him to tell him to tone down his comments about Mexico because it was hurting the party\u2019s image, Trump took to Twitter to rebut press characterizations. Occasionally voters give presidential candidates the single-finger salute for blocking traffic in primary states. You can imagine Trump stopping his motorcade to return fire.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the normal behavior of a presidential candidate\u2014which is exactly the ticket that Trump is running on. He\u2019s not a candidate; he\u2019s a brand. He has exchanged the normal politician\u2019s clich\u00e9s for clich\u00e9s about his high-end real estate holdings. He can\u2019t mention one of them without testifying to its luxuriousness\u2014the \u201cmagnificent ballroom at Trump National Doral in Miami,\u201d or his golf course in Los Angeles that\u2019s \u201cperhaps the most valuable parcel of land in all of golf.\u201d Because his company\u2019s name is his name, his campaign placards are also marketing material for his fine and luxuriant properties, which are the envy of discerning travelers accustomed to high thread-count amenities.\n\nBut the brand is taking a hit. It\u2019s not just that companies are leaving him because they don\u2019t want to be associated with someone so offensive. One of the latest is Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, the D.C.\u2013based chef with a growing national brand, who dropped a deal to open the flagship restaurant in Trump\u2019s Washington hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. What\u2019s happening now is that companies find it profitable, or at least to their public relations advantage, to get in the news cycle for abandoning Trump.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn a recent Trump press release, the tycoon calls out NASCAR and ESPN for making a big story about dropping their relationships with him. \u201cThe disassociation of ESPN and NASCAR with the Trump Organization was covered by the press in headlines all over the world as though it was a major setback for me. Really? What were the losses?\u201d he asks. He then goes on to say that all he lost were commitments to use one ballroom and a golf course. Puny stuff, he argues, though not so puny that he doesn\u2019t take the chance to point out that he\u2019s pocketing the deposits for each cancellation and making money off the properties now that they are freed up. \u201cI get two fees instead of one,\u201d he boasts.\n\nShouldn\u2019t Trump, the consummate marketer, know what\u2019s going on here? People are willing to boast about abandoning their associations with him no matter how small because the bandwagon is rolling and they want to do the cool thing. It\u2019s so hip to drop Trump, it\u2019s amazing that it didn\u2019t start in Brooklyn.\n\nHe\u2019s pocketed some extra cash, perhaps, but surely as a born salesman he knows that the expense that can\u2019t be tallied on a bill of sale is that his name is becoming something people flee from. With each new divestiture, no matter how small the underlying deal, it cements this image.\n\nThis isn\u2019t about votes. There is a group of Republican voters who like what Trump is saying, how he says it, and don\u2019t mind that the political clowns are being ruffled by this party-crasher. So the controversy could help Trump in a limited way politically. Still, his chances of becoming president are less than infinitesimal.

The DOJ just gave the radical left a new weapon for punishing thoughtcrimes.\n\nIt gets worse. Veterans and their same-sex spouses now have a right to be buried together in a national cemetery. Before the Supreme Court\u2019s lawless usurpation of power, voters were able to force gay veterans and their spouses to be buried apart. That\u2019s how a healthy democracy functions. But because five lawyers decided to violate the will of the people, cemetery employees will be forced to place the bodies of gay married veterans in adjacent graves. The persecution is already here.\n\nThis \u201cBury My Spouse\u2014Or Else!\u201d attitude is typical of the secular left, which is eager to crush religious liberty at every turn. The DOJ\u2019s new policies are just another anti-democratic, anti-Christian consequence of the Supreme Court\u2019s disastrous decision. We live in a dangerous age for the truly faithful when devout Americans cannot even work at a VA hospital or national cemetery without being forced to violate their freedom of conscience.

Either that, or they\u2019ve just given the business mogul and former reality TV star another reason to stick around well into the fall, if not beyond.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\nThe Washington Post is reporting that Fox News has clarified the criteria for participation in the first GOP debate in such a way that Trump and most of his fellow candidates will have to file their personal financial disclosures before the debate or be kept off the stage. That\u2019s unlikely to be a serious problem for the vast majority of the GOP field, but it will back Trump into a corner.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\n\"As we have said from the beginning, part of that criteria involves filing 'all necessary paperwork with the [Federal Election Commission],'\" Fox News vice president Michael Clemente said in a statement. \"The FEC, as is well known, requires that presidential candidates file a financial disclosure statement as part of that paperwork.\" Under federal law, presidential candidates have 30 days from when they officially launch their campaigns to file. But candidates can, and often do, request and receive as many as two 45-day extensions\u2014something most Trump watchers believed he would do as way to prolong his campaign without giving the world a closer look at his finances. While Clemente\u2019s statement didn\u2019t explicitly say candidates couldn\u2019t use those extensions, the Post\u2019s sources say that will indeed be the case. \"They must fill out the form, putting the dollars and cents on the table, before they step on the debate stage,\" one source told the paper.\n\nFor his part, Trump said during his campaign launch last month that he won\u2019t be asking for any extensions\u2014\u201cWe\u2019ll be filing right on time\u201d\u2014although the media has treated that claim with the dubiousness it deserves. If he doesn\u2019t ask for an extension, Trump would have until July 22 to file his disclosure. If he does file, the world will get a rare firsthand look at his business empire, the exact worth of which remains very much in debate. If he would have been allowed to take his extensions by Fox, he would have been able to take part in the debate and still drop out of the race later this year without ever having to declare how much he\u2019s actually worth as opposed to how much he claims to be worth.\n\nFox News is stressing that it hasn\u2019t changed the criteria, and instead is simply clarifying them. That move appears designed to allay the GOP establishment\u2019s fears about Trump without giving the impression that the conservative network\u2014which rarely misses an opportunity to bring Trump on the air\u2014is bowing to the party\u2019s demands. Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz, though, had already reportedly requested their own extensions, suggesting at the very least that their campaigns were unaware of Fox\u2019s strict reading of the rules until today. (Meanwhile, it\u2019s unclear if any candidate who launches his campaign between now and the Aug. 6 debate\u2014say Scott Walker or John Kasich\u2014will have to file before then or if they can participate without doing so since their original 30-day window will not have expired.)\n\nOf course, predicting what The Donald will do and what he won\u2019t is a bit of a fool\u2019s errand at this point\u2014and backing him into a corner may only make him more unpredictable. Given the damage his presidential campaign has already done to his business dealings, he may simply decide he\u2019s sacrificed too much to turn tail and run before seizing the spotlight in Cleveland and the free PR that comes with it. Perhaps even more troubling for the GOP establishment, then, is that if Trump does file in time to take part in the first debate he\u2019ll have one less reason to drop out anytime in the foreseeable future.\n\nPreviously on the Slatest:", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:17:23.066+0000"}
{"entityId": 516, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In the short term, this will be hard. Republicans will have to admit that they were wrong. But in exchange, they\u2019ll be freed to fight for their values. And whatever support they lose on the right will be offset by a fresh appeal to the center. The public is ready for this message. That\u2019s the silver lining in the GOP\u2019s defeat on gay marriage: The fact that Republicans misunderstood the issue means that they never lost what was important. Americans didn\u2019t sign up for lifestyle liberalism or for dissolving the meaning of matrimony. If you study polls, you\u2019ll see what really happened: People embraced same-sex marriage not because they saw homosexuality as a matter of personal choice, but because they didn\u2019t.\n\nThat\u2019s where a younger, wiser generation of Republicans needs to step in. They must break the link between same-sex marriage and lifestyle liberalism. Not all family structures are equal. Divorce, single parenthood, and promiscuity are real problems. So is the replacement of marriage by cohabitation or domestic partnership. To be heard on those issues, Republicans have to build a middle ground in which Obergefell is welcomed and understood, not as a gateway to equal recognition and benefits regardless of how you live , but as an affirmation of marriage.\n\nRepublicans are right to worry about redefining marriage. But their decision to draw the line at sexual orientation was a profound mistake. They thought homosexuality was a lifestyle. In reality, the only lifestyle at stake is marriage itself . By locking gay people out of that institution, Republicans disserved their party\u2019s mission: a well-ordered society. And by asserting that there was no logical stopping point between homosexuality, polygamy, and infidelity, the right helped the left. Today Republicans find themselves in a de facto alliance with people who want to eliminate all discrimination among family structures . Some social liberals are claiming that if you support marriage equality for same-sex couples, you have to support it for multiple partners as well. Some right-wing groups agree . Both sides want to make Americans choose between lifestyle liberalism and rolling back gay marriage.\n\nThese men are leading the GOP in the wrong direction. There\u2019s a simpler, saner way for Republicans to regain their footing on social issues. Go back to being the party of lifestyle conservatism: marriage, parenthood, community, faith, commitment, self-discipline, and social order. Recognize same-sex marriage as part of that tradition . Now that the fight for \u201cmarriage equality\u201d has been won, the next fight is about what that victory means. Are we welcoming same-sex couples, like different-race couples, to an enduring institution? Or are we rethinking the rules of marriage and its place in society? That\u2019s a debate to which social conservatives should contribute. And it\u2019s a fight the GOP can win.\n\nIn 2004, 37 percent of respondents in a Gallup poll said homosexuality was \u201csomething a person is born with.\u201d Forty-one percent said it was \u201cdue to factors such as upbringing and environment.\u201d Since then, the numbers have reversed. Two months ago, 51 percent of respondents told Gallup that gay or lesbian orientation was inborn; only 30 percent attributed it to upbringing or environment. If you focus on the set of respondents in Gallup\u2019s samples who say that homosexuality is environmentally influenced, you\u2019ll find that they\u2019re more sympathetic to gay marriage, on average, than they were 11 years ago. But you\u2019ll also find that the percentage of Americans who think homosexuality is environmentally influenced, and who nonetheless support gay marriage, has increased by only 1 point. By contrast, the percentage of Americans who think homosexuality is inborn, and who also support gay marriage, has increased by 20 points.\n\nGallup\u2019s question isn\u2019t ideal, because people who attribute homosexuality to \u201cupbringing and environment\u201d don\u2019t necessarily think it\u2019s immutable. The Pew Research Center has a question that nails this down: \u201cDo you think a gay or lesbian person\u2019s sexual orientation can be changed or cannot be changed?\u201d In 2003, Pew\u2019s respondents were evenly divided on this question. Since then, the numbers have diverged. In surveys taken in 2006, 2012, and 2015, the percentage who said orientation could be changed steadily declined, from 42 to 39 to 36 to 33. Meanwhile, the percentage who said orientation couldn\u2019t be changed steadily grew, from 42 to 49 to 51 to 60. Support for same-sex marriage has risen in both categories. But overall, the percentage of Americans who think homosexuality can be changed, and who support gay marriage, is only 3 points higher than it was in 2003. The remainder of the national increase in support for gay marriage\u2014more than 23 percentage points\u2014is attributable to people who think homosexuality can\u2019t be changed.\n\nThe best way to get at lifestyle liberalism is to ask about homosexuality as a choice. The only survey I\u2019ve found that has posed this question consistently over time is the ABC News/Washington Post poll. In 1994 the poll asked: \u201cDo you think being homosexual is something that people choose to be, or do you think it\u2019s just the way they are?\u201d From 1994 to 2004 to 2014, the percentage of respondents who said homosexuality was a choice fell from 40 to 33 to 25. Meanwhile, the percentage who said it was \u201cjust the way they are\u201d rose from 49 to 57 to 65. In these surveys, people who say homosexuality is a choice are no more supportive of gay marriage today than they were two decades ago. In 1994, 25 percent of these respondents said \u201chomosexuals should ... have equal rights to marry one another.\u201d In 2014, only 23 percent said yes to a more sympathetic version of the question: \u201callowing gays and lesbians to marry legally.\u201d Overall, the percentage of ABC/Post respondents who think homosexuality is a choice and endorse same-sex marriage is 4 points lower than it was in 1994.\n\nTogether, these polls make a strong case that lifestyle liberalism has not driven the massive surge in public support for gay marriage. Instead, many Americans have decided that homosexuality is an immutable trait, and they have adjusted their views accordingly. If homosexuality isn\u2019t a choice, it can\u2019t be a sin. We can\u2019t make gay people straight, but we can let them marry.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean lifestyle liberalism hasn\u2019t been spreading. It has. If you look at Gallup\u2019s table of attitudes on moral acceptability over the last 14 years, you\u2019ll see a 16-point increase in acceptance of \u201chaving a baby outside of marriage,\u201d a 15-point increase for \u201csex between an unmarried man and woman,\u201d a 12-point increase for divorce, and a 9-point increase for polygamy. But nothing matches the 23-point increase on \u201cgay or lesbian relations\u201d or the 25-point increase on same-sex marriage. To find a question on which the public has moved as dramatically as it has on same-sex marriage, you have to scroll down the page to this one: \u201cDo you approve or disapprove of marriage between blacks and whites?\u201d On that question, public support has risen by 22 points since 2002. The magnitude of the shift on gay marriage mirrors the magnitude of the shift on interracial marriage, perhaps because Americans are coming to believe that sexual orientation is more like the color of your skin than like the content of your character.\n\nI\u2019m not a big fan of using the government to reward or punish sexual behavior. It\u2019s a clumsy tool, and when the rules it applies are equally clumsy, it does more harm than good. But lifestyle liberalism can also do a lot of damage. It can overrun and erode moral institutions. We need a party that speaks that truth. Republicans should be that party.

The holdout, American Samoa, is currently stalling but could eventually be forced by a lawsuit to comply. You might assume that, since these territories are part of America, the marriage equality decision applies to them just as it does all 50 states. But in fact, the decision\u2019s application to the territories was by no means a sure thing\u2014and had the opinion been written differently, the U.S. territories might have found a way to avoid complying with it.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nAs I explained in March, the Constitution does not apply with equal force to states and territories. Instead, the Supreme Court has long stated that the Constitution guarantees only \u201cfundamental rights\u201d to the territories and their citizens. (Puerto Rico, a commonwealth, is treated like a state for most constitutional purposes.) Other rights, even those promised to other U.S. citizens, are negotiable. Courts have held that even rights most Americans would think of as fundamental\u2014a right to a jury trial or equal protection of the laws\u2014have been jettisoned when territorial governments object to them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court created this distinction in the 1901 Insular Cases, building on the racist assumption that the \u201calien races\u201d of the territories \u201cdiff[er] from us\u201d too much. (\u201cUs\u201d means white people.) More recently, some justices have favored a different test, which asks whether the application of a constitutional right to a territory would be \u201cimpracticable and anomalous.\u201d If not, the right must apply.\n\nThis test is much less malleable (and racist) than the old \u201cfundamental rights\u201d test. But the Insular Cases remain on the books, and so the old rule arguably remains the law of the land. That means any territorial government seeking to sidestep a Supreme Court ruling could simply argue that the specific right the justices articulated isn\u2019t \u201cfundamental.\u201d\n\nThat, however, isn\u2019t really possible in the case of marriage equality, for one simple reason: In his majority opinion, Justice Anthony Kennedy describes marriage as a \u201cfundamental right\u201d guaranteed to same-sex couples 10 times. Had Kennedy used only an equal protection rationale, some territories might have argued that the soft-core version of equal protection that applies to them permits same-sex marriage bans. But Kennedy pulled out the big guns, placing the fundamental right rationale at the center of his opinion and leaning on equal protection as a secondary argument. No one could claim, with a straight face, that Kennedy\u2019s ruling does not apply fully to every territory.\n\nSome commentators believe that the fate of same-sex marriage in American Samoa is inextricably linked to an ongoing lawsuit arguing that the island\u2019s inhabits have a right to citizenship. (Currently, American Samoans are \u201cU.S. nationals,\u201d not citizens.) I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right. Oddly, the Supreme Court has never squarely held that citizenship is a fundamental right\u2014even though the 14th Amendment clearly grants it to everyone born in the United States. Marriage, on the other hand, is now indisputably a fundamental right of every American. That\u2019s how bizarre territorial constitutional law is in 2015: American Samoans may get the right to same-sex marriage before they get to the right to be U.S. citizens.\n\nRead more of Slate\u2019s coverage of same-sex marriage at the Supreme Court.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:17:57.096+0000"}

{"entityId": 519, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by STR/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYale historian Jonathan Spence once famously posited that since the times of Marco Polo, the West has invariably seen China through the same lens that it sees itself. As global equity markets swoon in response to the recent meltdown in Chinese stocks, these deep-rooted biases are in play once again. The Western version of China has darkened out of fear of asset bubbles, excess investment, and debt overhangs\u2014precisely the same imbalances that have afflicted the major economies of the developed world over the past two decades. The truth is far less bleak.\n\nChina\u2019s plunging stock market is the most obvious case in point. Yes, a big bubble has burst\u2014as of July 8, the domestic Chinese equity market has fallen by 31 percent from its June 12 peak after surging by nearly 150 percent over the preceding year. Notwithstanding massive government support actions now being unleashed, there\u2019s no telling how much further the sell-off has to go. The question for China is precisely the same as that which was raised by the bursting of earlier stock bubbles\u2014especially those in Japan and the United States: Will the carnage in asset markets do lasting damage to China\u2019s real economy?\n\nIn contrast with sentiment in the Western press, China is not the next Japan or the next Greece.\n\nThe answer is no. The linkage between asset markets and economic activity is captured through what economists call \u201cwealth effects\u201d\u2014basically the capital gains (both realized and psychological) that consumers accrue from the ups and downs of asset prices. An unbalanced Chinese economy has a built-in insulation from the downside of these wealth effects. Consumption is only 36 percent of its GDP\u2014literally half that in the U.S., where consumer demand growth has been more than halved over the post-bubble period of the past seven years. While speculators who were borrowing on margin to buy stocks will undoubtedly feel pain as the Chinese bubble bursts, these impacts are likely to be limited. China, with its still-embryonic consumption sector, and without an American-style overhang of household debt, is unlikely to suffer from the wrenching balance-sheet recessions that afflicted the United States and Japan.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nWhat about China\u2019s notorious investment bubble\u2014the \u201cghost cities\u201d you see on 60 Minutes, the excess capacity in steel, cement, plate glass, and other basic industries, or an investment share that approaches an unheard-of 50 percent of GDP? From a Western perspective, these are all telltale signs of imbalance and impending collapse. But that\u2019s not the case for China.\n\nThere are two main reasons for that. First, China is going through unprecedented urbanization. Since 2000, its urban population has increased by approximately 20 million citizens per year. In terms of shelter and its associated infrastructure requirements, China is adding the equivalent of 2\u00bd New York Citys a year. With urbanization likely to continue at this rate through at least 2030, that spells high investment for years to come.\n\nSecond, there is the critical difference between stocks and flows\u2014something that is drilled into college undergraduates in their first economics course. The investment share of GDP, a flow, is high in China in large part because the stock of productive capital is so low. That largely reflects the sad state of the Chinese economy in the late 1970s in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution. In fact, China\u2019s stock of capital per worker\u2014long recognized as a key driver of productivity\u2014is currently less than 15 percent of that of the United States and Japan. China\u2019s economic development will depend critically on its ability to raise its capital-to-labor ratio\u2014an outcome that requires it to maintain a high investment share of its GDP for the foreseeable future.\n\nBut surely China\u2019s debt load\u2014estimated at close to 250 percent of its GDP\u2014is cause for concern. This is a Japanese-style problem that on the surface appears likely to end in tears. But here, as well, the Western lens that Spence warns of clouds the analysis.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:18:14.000+0000"}
{"entityId": 520, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by John Moore/Getty Images\n\nWith his angry rants against undocumented immigrants, Donald Trump is a stark reminder of the GOP\u2019s terrible problem with Latino voters. In short, Latinos don\u2019t like\u2014or trust\u2014the Republican Party.\n\nJamelle Bouie Jamelle Bouie is Slate\u2019s chief political correspondent.\n\nBut Trump also illustrates a second, more complicated problem. As long as his rhetoric has a place in Republican politics\u2014as long as it has defenders\u2014it won\u2019t just alienate Latinos. It will offend and turn off voters who have conservative ideas and beliefs but won\u2019t sanction or support anti-immigrant sentiment.\n\nBefore looking at this other side to the \u201cLatino problem,\u201d it\u2019s worth examining the first one. In the past two presidential elections, Democrats have won more than two-thirds of Latino voters, reversing and eroding gains made during George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Part of this is anti-Republican backlash after the 2008 recession and the tail end of the Bush presidency, but even more is the intense anti-immigration wave that swept the GOP in the wake of the Tea Party\u2019s rapid rise to prominence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIn the past six years, GOP states have targeted Latinos for greater scrutiny, GOP officials have called for \u201cself-deportation\u201d of undocumented immigrants, and GOP presidential candidates have stood with nakedly anti-immigrant politicians. And although there are smart, reasoned arguments against comprehensive immigration reform and other permissive immigration policies, the rhetoric that counts\u2014that resonates with actual Republican voters\u2014comes from figures such as Iowa Rep. Steve King, who once warned that a path to citizenship would \u201cdestroy our republic.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Latinos don\u2019t just oppose particular candidates, such as Mitt Romney. They disdain the Republican label itself. According to a 2014 survey from the Pew Research Center, just 10 percent of Latinos say that the Republican Party \u201chas concern\u201d for their communities, compared with 50 percent who say as much about the Democratic Party. Few agree with Republicans on policy\u2014especially immigration\u2014and just 27 percent of Latinos identify with the Republican Party, compared with 63 percent who identify with Democrats. Not surprisingly, this has carried over to the 2016 GOP presidential field. As of October, notes Latino Decisions, just 32 percent of Latino voters would consider a vote for Jeb Bush, just 35 percent would consider a vote for Sen. Marco Rubio, and just 24 percent would consider a vote for Sen. Ted Cruz.\n\nWriting for the Washington Post\u2014and prompted by Trump and the qualified defense he received from writers such as Rich Lowry of the National Review\u2014conservative columnist Michael Gerson examines the two Republican camps for dealing with this \u201cLatino problem\u201d ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe first camp, best represented by Jeb Bush, wants to expand the Republican brand into Latino communities. It believes the GOP is \u201ctoo closely identified with the boardroom and the country club,\u201d Gerson writes, and wants to fix that with outreach to new constituencies. If Republicans could return to their earlier performance with Latino voters, they could win Colorado and Nevada, or at least make them competitive again in national elections.\n\nLatinos don\u2019t just oppose particular candidates, such as Mitt Romney. They disdain the Republican label itself.\n\nBut this isn\u2019t a costless strategy. In reaching for Latino voters\u2014with greater support for immigration reform or redistributive policy\u2014Republicans risk alienating core supporters in the white working class who associate immigration with economic insecurity. Which brings us to the second, and arguably dominant, camp. These reformers also believe that the GOP \u201chas been too dominated by corporate interests and needs to identify more directly with the economic frustrations of working-class voters,\u201d Gerson writes. Their solution, however, is a greater focus on the white working class. If a Republican could win 65 percent, or more, of the white vote, he would carry places such as Ohio and Iowa, as well as Democratic states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. Not only does it make up for Colorado and Nevada, but it also makes up for Florida, another vital state where Latino voters are concentrated and critical to success.\n\nIn some ways, notes Gerson, Trump is the extreme version of this strategy. He speaks to the anxieties of working-class whites, channeling fear and discomfort with angry, belligerent nationalism. But there are other ways to make this pitch. In his successful campaigns for governor, Scott Walker mobilized huge numbers of supporters in the reddest counties of Wisconsin to win narrow victories over Democratic opponents.\n\nPart of this was raw partisanship\u2014galvanizing conservative voters against unions and public employees. But part of it was playing the suburbs against the cities\u2014Milwaukee in particular\u2014and harnessing the racially polarized politics of the area. And on the stump in the Republican primary, notes the New York Times, Walker \u201cwins applause by noting his efforts to require drug tests of people receiving public assistance, and uses language reminiscent of old, loaded appeals about indolent welfare recipients.\u201d As one conservative writer told the Times, his is a \u201cpopulist strategy that doubles down on turning out disaffected white men.\u201d\n\nBut this brings us back to the second problem. The appeals the GOP uses to turn out disaffected whites\u2014and maximize white support writ large\u2014could backfire, both with Latinos and with other whites, who have nonwhite friends, neighbors, spouses, and partners and see themselves as tolerant. In working to maximize their share of the white vote, Republicans who take this path could lower their ceiling.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear that there\u2019s a way out of this dilemma. But if there is, his name is Marco Rubio. There\u2019s no evidence the Florida senator can pull Latinos back to the Republican Party, but as a young Spanish-speaking politician of Cuban descent, he projects the same cosmopolitanism of Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign.

{"entityId": 521, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by David Greedy/Getty Images\n\nOn Tuesday, Hillary Clinton talked to CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar for her first national interview as a 2016 presidential candidate. The Democratic front-runner addressed some of the questions surrounding her use of a private server to house her State Department emails while she was secretary of state. The conversation wasn\u2019t about the content of those emails as much as whether Clinton\u2019s special ad hoc system for storing her emails\u2014and her previous explanations about what messages she shared and what messages she deleted\u2014were at the root of voters\u2019 distrust of her.\n\nClinton\u2019s answers won\u2019t put questions about her trustworthiness to rest. She said the issue of the emails \u201cis being blown up with no basis in law or fact.\u201d Whether it is being blown up depends on whether you think her original decision to set up her own private server is a serious breach or not. But leaving that question aside, there\u2019s no doubt that there is a sound basis for the questions being asked of Clinton.\n\nTake a look at the fine print. According to the 2009 National Archives and Records Administration regulations in effect when Clinton was in office, \u201cAgencies that allow employees to send and receive official electronic mail messages using a system not operated by the agency must ensure that Federal records sent or received on such systems are preserved in the appropriate agency record-keeping system.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s answers won\u2019t put questions about her trustworthiness to rest.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThat regulation does allow for storage on private servers. Clinton says she made a practice of emailing officials on their official email accounts, so her work emails were immediately captured by the government\u2019s servers. Maybe, but this was her own system and it didn\u2019t meet the standard of \u201cappropriate agency record-keeping system,\u201d which is why when the State Department tried to complete document requests, they missed the emails held on Clinton\u2019s private server. While other officials have used private email accounts in the past, no one used them exclusively as Clinton did.\n\nThe substantive reason this matters is that congressional investigators want to know if they really have access to all of the former secretary of state\u2019s emails. As a matter of trust, voters have to determine whether Clinton\u2019s claim to CNN that there\u2019s nothing to see here matches her bespoke practice, which was outside the boundaries of rules and custom.\n\nSince Clinton acted as the judge of what should be turned over and what shouldn\u2019t, it\u2019s legitimate to ask whether the standard she used for deleting or passing on emails meets the spirit of the rules. The spirit of the rules was to keep all correspondence related to the job. That\u2019s why the presumption is that employee records are automatically retained and personal email accounts in which official business is conducted happens less frequently. Clinton\u2019s arrangement was the opposite.\n\nAt her press conference addressing her online habits in March, Clinton said that in deciding which emails to turn over she wanted to \u201cerr on the side of providing anything that could be possibly viewed as work related.\u201d She wasn't just being careful, she said, she was being extra careful. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution and care, you know, we wanted to send that message unequivocally.\u201d She reiterated that claim this week: \u201cI turned over everything that I could imagine.\u201d But we know that some of her emails were not turned over to the State Department. Those were work related it would seem. Either that, or her definition of \u201cwork related\u201d has some expanse in it. However, there\u2019s also evidence that Clinton\u2019s definition of \u201cwork related\u201d was too constricted. More than 1,200 emails were returned by the State Department for being too personal. This is just the kind of confusion that the government\u2019s retention system requirements were set up to minimize.\n\nClinton also said in her CNN interview that she \u201cdidn\u2019t have to turn over anything\u201d and \u201c[she] chose to turn over 55,000 pages because [she] wanted to go above and beyond what was expected of [her].\u201d Later, she repeated that she had \u201cno obligation\u201d to turn over her emails to the State Department.\n\nThat isn\u2019t true. It leaves the impression that since handing over the emails was completely voluntary, the candidate can\u2019t fall short of any standard. But as Secretary Clinton said in her first press conference about this issue in March, she did have an obligation to turn over the emails. \u201cThat was my obligation,\u201d she said of turning over the emails. \u201cI fully fulfilled it.\u201d It was not only State Department practice that employees were to keep their emails in the system, the State Department also made a special request of all former secretaries of state after Clinton left.

In that document, Cosby acknowledged that in the 1970s he obtained Quaaludes, a now-illegal sedative, to give to women he wanted to have sex with. The deposition was sealed and remained so for a decade. But Monday the AP revealed that it convinced a judge to unseal a portion of the deposition\u2014not because Cosby has been thrust into the news but because Cosby thrust himself into a public campaign of moralizing at black Americans.\n\nMark Joseph Stern Mark Joseph Stern is a writer for Slate. He covers the law and LGBTQ issues.\n\nAlthough the press and the public have a First Amendment right to access judicial proceedings in criminal cases, that right gets muddled in a civil complaint like this one. (Cosby\u2019s accuser wasn\u2019t trying to send him to jail; the statute of limitations had passed. She was suing him for damages.) Depositions are part of \u201cdiscovery\u201d\u2014the phase of a lawsuit when each party makes the other produce relevant information. There\u2019s no presumptive right for the press or public to access discovery materials, even when they\u2019ve been filed with a trial court, as Cosby\u2019s deposition had. Still, the American legal tradition frowns on absolute secrecy for any kind of court materials. So any party seeking to keep a deposition sealed must show \u201cgood cause\u201d to keep the information out of the public eye.\n\nIn many cases, privacy interests constitute the good cause necessary to keep a deposition sealed. Private figures shouldn\u2019t fear that intimate details of their lives will be revealed just because they\u2019re involved in a lawsuit. And even public figures, like politicians and celebrities, maintain some privacy rights in civil suits. Cosby\u2019s overall fame\u2014his TV celebrity, his standup comedy\u2014doesn\u2019t automatically destroy his privacy rights as soon as he\u2019s sued. As U.S. District Judge Eduardo Robreno explains in his order, that would create perverse incentives, encouraging gossip rags to file frivolous lawsuits just to get ahold of and publish information about celebrities\u2019 private lives.\n\nTo prove his point, Judge Robreno cites three of Cosby\u2019s most infamous criticisms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nInstead, Robreno notes that a very specific aspect of Cosby\u2019s public persona is at issue here: Cosby\u2019s decision to don \u201cthe mantle of public moralist\u201d and mount the \u201csoap box to volunteer his views on, among other things, childrearing, family life, education, and crime.\u201d As a mere comic, Cosby might maintain most of his privacy rights. But as a \u201cpublic moralist,\u201d he has \u201cvoluntarily narrowed the zone of privacy that he is entitled to claim.\u201d\n\nTo prove his point, Robreno cites three of Cosby\u2019s most infamous criticisms. First, Robreno describes the \u201cpound cake\u201d speech, delivered at an NAACP event celebrating the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. During the speech, Cosby scolded black Americans for, among other things, allegedly stealing food:\n\nLooking at the incarcerated, these are not political criminals. These are people going around stealing Coca Cola. People getting shot in the back of the head over a piece of pound cake! Then we all run out and are outraged, \u201cThe cops shouldn\u2019t have shot him!\u201d What the hell was he doing with the pound cake in his hand?\n\nRobreno than cites a CNN interview with Don Lemon in which Cosby chastised black men for ostensibly abandoning their children and railed against the \u201cno-groes\u201d who defend black culture.\n\nFinally, Robreno cites Cosby\u2019s speech to Temple University graduates in which he told them that algebra is easier than cotton picking.\n\nBecause of harangues like these, Robreno writes, the AP has a legitimate interest in accessing Cosby\u2019s deposition:\n\nThe stark contrast between Bill Cosby, the public moralist, and Bill Cosby, the subject of serious allegations concerning improper (and perhaps criminal) conduct, is a matter as to which the AP\u2014and by extension the public\u2014has a significant interest.\n\nWeighing Cosby\u2019s \u201cdiminished privacy interest\u201d against the public\u2019s interest in accessing his deposition, Robreno decided that the public\u2019s interest should win out. Cosby failed to show \u201cgood cause\u201d as to why his deposition should remain secret. As should usually happen in situations like these, transparency trumped secrecy.\n\nA remarkably uninformed op-ed in the Federalist by Bill McMorris claimed that Robreno \u201cunsealed Bill Cosby\u2019s criminal record to punish him for saying things the judge doesn\u2019t like.\u201d* That is wrong as a matter of fact and a matter of law. The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure lean toward judicial openness and thus require Cosby\u2014not the AP\u2014to show good cause for keeping his deposition sealed. Cosby failed to meet this standard, in large part because his moralization actually increased the public\u2019s interest in the content of his deposition. McMorris and Cosby\u2019s other defenders want to turn Robreno\u2019s order into a political issue. It\u2019s not. It\u2019s an issue of law\u2014and Cosby found himself on the wrong side of it.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:18:38.525+0000"}

Simply stated, it is a legal fiction imposed upon the entirety of this nation because these five people think it should be. No one contests the historical definition of marriage as a union of a man and a woman or its social necessity to protect the product of their physical union, i.e., children. While I have many friends in same-sex relationships, I respectfully would not bestow upon them legal rights of marriage as having a child of their physical union is literally impossible.\n\nAnd, in a melancholy peroration, accused the Obergefell majority of more or less destroying American democracy:\n\nIt is a sad day in America when five lawyers beholden to none and appointed for life can rob the people of their democratic process, forcing so-called civil liberties regarding who can marry on all Americans when the issue was decided by the states as solemn expressions of the will of the people.

{"entityId": 526, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by geliatida/Shutterstock\n\nKevin Noble Maillard has written a fascinating piece for the Atlantic about Christopher Emanuel, a South Carolina man who struggled to gain custody of his daughter after her mother gave her up for adoption without telling him about it. The story exposes some major flaws in the adoption system that stem, in large part, from the knotty question of how to find balance between father's rights and the well-being of children in a world where many fathers refuse to take responsibility.\n\nAmanda Marcotte Amanda Marcotte is a Brooklyn-based writer and DoubleX contributor. She also writes regularly for the Daily Beast, AlterNet, and USA Today.\n\nThe story is a deeply sympathetic one. Emanuel, who is black, was dating a white woman when she became pregnant. Things went well for them at first\u2014as their texting history shows\u2014until her family found out. At this point, according to Emanuel, her openly racist parents\u2014they called him, to his face, the N-word\u2014started wedging him out of the picture and pushing her to give up the baby. She gave birth without telling him and gave the baby up for adoption before he knew she was born.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nIt's not entirely unreasonable to give women this right, despite the awfulness of Emanuel's dilemma. A major concern is that a man can impregnate a woman and then just disappear, making it impossible for the woman to give the baby up for adoption without the man's say-so.\n\nStill, fathers have rights. As Maillard details, if a man can demonstrate that he did stick around and try to provide for the woman and child, then he has earned parental rights. Additionally, many states have a putative-father registry that a man can use to declare himself before the baby is born; the state is then required to inform him if the mother tries to give the baby up for adoption. The problem is that many fathers don't know about the registry; in practice, it exists mostly to provide cover for adoptive families.\n\nEmanuel did register, which helped his case. What really cinched it, though, was his text-messaging history, which showed everything from his great excitement about welcoming his daughter to the world to his concern about the mother's day-by-day blood-sugar levels. He won custody, but only after demonstrating that he had the means to provide for his daughter as well as an emotional investment. As Maillard writes:\n\n\u201cEven though we\u2019ve had progress in the active role that men take in their children\u2019s lives, the state still defines breadwinning as the definitive component of fatherhood,\u201d said Deborah Dinner, an associate professor of family law at Washington University. Staying in good standing can mean as little as an automated direct deposit, but anything less than an actual offer of money is considered by law to be \u201cvague and conditional.\u201d Even if the woman disappears or issues a restraining order, the man\u2019s potential support must be tangible and ready, like escrow.\n\nMen can gain paternal rights, Maillard adds, by being \u201cpersistent, aggressive, and proactive in offering money even when the mother rejects it or refuses contact.\u201d\n\nThe system makes life hard for good men like Emanuel, and it has real dangers for women as well. If a woman is trying to get away from an abusive man and is considering adoption to cut ties completely, it seems that all her abuser has to do is give her money\u2014or try to\u2014and potentially gain a foothold back in her life. If a man can use money to block the adoption, it will make it that much easier to stay in her life or even guilt her back into a relationship.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:18:56.571+0000"}

To give you a sense of how important religion is to U.S. voters relative to other traits they value, a 2014 Pew survey found that an atheist candidate was significantly more of a turnoff than a gay candidate, or a candidate known to have had an extramarital affair. Still, just about every president in American history, starting with George Washington, has faced grumbling that they weren\u2019t Christian enough.\n\nRuth Graham Ruth Graham is a regular Slate contributor. She lives in New Hampshire.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, all the serious current candidates for the 2016 presidential election say they are Christians of one kind or another. There\u2019s a Methodist, a Seventh-day Adventist, and a couple of Southern Baptists. But at this crowded early stage, there are two Republican candidates whose religious pedigrees stand out. Both Bobby Jindal and Jeb Bush are part of the same long American religious tradition: They are converts to Catholicism.\n\nTheir Catholicism, which they share with a notable number of other 2016 candidates\u2014including Marco Rubio, George Pataki, and Rick Santorum\u2014raises its own intriguing questions. The United States has only had one Catholic president, John F. Kennedy, and he was elected in a cloud of suspicion that he would secretly take orders from the Vatican. But by the time John Kerry ran in 2004, Catholicism was hardly a third rail. There had been several Catholic nominees for vice president\u2014Joe Biden is Catholic\u2014and Protestants and Catholics simply view each other much less suspiciously than they did in the past. That\u2019s good news: We\u2019ve mellowed a lot since the days when a prominent Protestant minister warned of the Catholic 1928 Democratic candidate, \u201cIf you vote for Al Smith, you\u2019re voting against Christ.\u201d (Likewise, despite the continuing disdain for atheists, Pew\u2019s findings suggest we\u2019re warming on that front, too.)\n\nBoth Bobby Jindal and Jeb Bush are part of the same long American religious tradition: They are converts to Catholicism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nBut Bush and Jindal\u2019s status as converts is just as intriguing, in part because America is a nation of converts. According to a large Pew analysis released in May, about one-quarter of all Americans have a different religious identity than the one they were raised in\u2014and that\u2019s not counting the significant number who have abandoned religious identity altogether.\n\nWithin this cohort, its Jindal and Bush\u2019s choice of religion that makes them unusual: According to Pew, just 2 percent of American adults are Catholic converts, while 13 percent are former Catholics. (Republican candidates John Kasich and Mike Pence were both born Catholic but no longer attend Catholic churches.) Jindal\u2019s exodus from Hinduism makes him a double-anomaly, given that Hinduism has the highest retention rate of any American religion, just ahead of Islam and Judaism.\n\nLincoln Mullen, a historian at George Mason University whose 2014 dissertation focused on conversion narratives in American history, differentiates conversion from simple denomination-switching as something that has a ritual associated with it (like a baptism or bar mitzvah)\u2014and as \u201csomething that would make your parents mad.\u201d Conversion to Catholicism fits the bill. It requires several formal steps called the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults, where Bush has said he found \u201ctotal serenity and solace.\u201d And for Jindal, at least, it became an issue with his parents, who he has described as \u201cvery, very concerned\u201d when he informed them of his conversion. (He says they have since come around.)\n\nJindal and Bush neatly illustrate what Mullen says are the two major professed motivations for conversion: marriage and a personal change of heart. Cynics might also add \u201cpolitical expediency,\u201d but as Mullen points out, motivations for conversion are always mixed, even among those who aren\u2019t trying to convince a 71 percent Christian nation to elect them to the highest office.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:19:29.392+0000"}

In response, though, Clinton opted for anodyne answers and talking points that offered little in the way of actual information.

Do you see any role that you've had in the sentiment that we've seen, where people are questioning whether you're trustworthy?\n\nCLINTON: I can only tell you, Brianna, that this has been a theme that has been used against me and my husband for many, many years. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: Would you vote for someone that you don't trust?\n\nCLINTON: Well, people should and do trust me. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: One of the issues that has eroded some trust that we've seen is the issue of your email practices while you were secretary of state. \u2026 Can you tell me the story of how you decided to delete 33,000 emails and how that deletion was executed?\n\nCLINTON: Well, let's start from the beginning. Everything I did was permitted. There was no law. There was no regulation. There was nothing that did not give me the full authority to decide how I was going to communicate. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: I know you say you were permitted. I just am trying to understand some of the thought process behind it. One former state attorney general, a Democrat, told CNN that they know of no lawyer who would advise someone, a client, facing the kind of scrutiny that you've been facing to wipe their server. I mean, what do you say to that?\n\nCLINTON: Well, what I say to that is I turned over everything I was obligated to turn over. And then I moved on. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: There has been a lot of controversy surrounding your family's foundation, The Clinton Foundation, corporate and foreign donations that have gone to the foundation and the work that it does. Has it made you think, seeing this controversy, that it's come about, has it made you think about if you are president, what will happen to The Clinton Foundation? Have you thought about perhaps shutting it down?\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 I have no plans to say or do anything about The Clinton Foundation other than to say how proud I am of it and that I think for the good of the world, its work should continue.\n\nKEILAR: Let's talk now about Republicans. \u2026 Right now the front-runner is Jeb Bush. Can you believe that a quarter century after your husband was elected, there could be another Bush-Clinton race?\n\nCLINTON: \u2026 What's great about America is anybody can run for president. That is literally true. ...\n\nKEILAR: Donald Trump is also creating quite a lot of commotion on the other side. ... What's your reaction to his recent comments that some Mexican immigrants are rapists and criminals?\n\nCLINTON: I'm very disappointed in those comments and I feel very bad and very disappointed with him and with the Republican Party for not responding immediately and saying, enough, stop it. But they are all in the same general area on immigration. They don't want to provide a path to citizenship. They range across a spectrum of being either grudgingly welcome or hostile toward immigrants. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: But what about Jeb Bush's approach to that? It's different, certainly, than Donald Trump's.\n\nCLINTON: Well, he doesn't believe in a path to citizenship. If he did at one time, he no longer does. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: Last week an undocumented immigrant who had been deported five times killed a 32-year-old woman, Kate Steinle, in San Francisco, a sanctuary city where local law enforcement does not enforce federal immigration laws. When you last ran for president you supported sanctuary cities. In light of this terrible incident, does that change anything about your view on this?\n\nCLINTON: Well, what should be done is any city should listen to the Department of Homeland Security, which as I understand it, urged them to deport this man again after he got out of prison another time. ... So I have absolutely no support for a city that ignores the strong evidence that should be acted on. However, there are [exceptions]\u2014like if it were a first-time traffic citation, if it were something minor, a misdemeanor, that's entirely different. This man had already been deported five times and he should have been deported at the request of the federal government.\n\nKEILAR: Just a couple quick questions before we go. What's changed when it comes to your approach with the media? \u2026 What's changed? Why now?\n\nCLINTON: Well, nothing's really changed. I just have a different rhythm to my campaign. I'm not running my campaign for the press. I'm running it for voters. I totally respect the press and what the press has to do. But I wanted and was determined to have the time that I needed to actually meet and listen to people. \u2026\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Have you given any thought to the woman who should be on the $10 bill?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: You know, I am very torn about it. I want a woman on a bill. I don't know why they take the $10 bill. Some people are now agitating for the $20 bill.\n\n\n\nKEILAR: Do you think it should be the $20?\n\nCLINTON: You know \u2026 I think that it might be easier to change the $20 than it is to change the $10. \u2026 And I don't like the idea that as a compromise you would basically have two people on the same bill. \u2026 So I think a woman should have her own bill. And it may be more appropriate to look at the $20 than the $10. I don't know. We'll see.\n\nKEILAR: And finally, I know you've seen your new doppelganger on Saturday Night Live, Kate McKinnon. \u2026 Who's the better Hillary Clinton, Kate McKinnon or Amy Poehler?\n\n\n\nCLINTON: Oh, you know, Amy's a friend of mine. And Kate's doing a great job. You're not going to get me to pick one or the other. I think I'm the best Hillary Clinton, to be honest. \u2026\n\nKEILAR: Secretary Clinton, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nCLINTON: My pleasure, thanks.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:19:32.543+0000"}

In fact, life there got worse as the 20 th century drew to a close. In 1987, sociologist William Julius Wilson published The Truly Disadvantaged , a seminal study in which he coined the term concentrated poverty to describe poor urban neighborhoods.\n\nThough in some dissenting, academic corners of the liberal establishment, Moynihan\u2019s characterizations of the poor were duly recognized as racist stereotypes, his observations spurred the War on Poverty\u2014a set of sweeping new laws that gave America food stamps, social security, guaranteed funding for primary and secondary education, and new jobs programs.\n\nThe report claimed that urban black Americans were caught up in a \u201ctangle of pathology.\u201d Unwed motherhood and unemployment led to intergenerational delinquency and alienation\u2014a mindset that kept poor black people stuck in place. Moynihan\u2019s report also indirectly assured white Americans that the problems of the black ghetto were not their fault.\n\nSince the 1960s, some in the liberal establishment (and many in the conservative one) have believed that a certain \u201cculture\u201d among black Americans predisposes them to poverty. To live in poor black communities, surrounded by this \u201cculture,\u201d is to condemn oneself and one\u2019s children to downward mobility. This idea has its roots in 19 th -century social Darwinism, but it resolutely became a matter of government policy and political speech 50 years ago, when then\u2013Assistant Secretary of Labor Daniel Patrick Moynihan published The Negro Family: The Case for National Action .\n\nNevertheless, we should remember that disparate-impact claims remain extremely difficult to make because gathering the necessary data is expensive and time-consuming. Far from ending discriminatory housing practices, the latest decision only helps ensure that, for now, one avenue for litigation against them remains open and may one day help some people move. Despite its significance, the Supreme Court decision highlights the ineffectiveness of current solutions for segregation, which are tied to how federal and local elected officials, informed by liberal think tanks such as the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute and countless liberal policy groups, think about poverty. If we want to make a dent in this problem, we should re-examine the terms in which we speak about it. We can start by tossing out concentrated poverty.\n\nIt is for this reason that we might cheer last month\u2019s Supreme Court decision in Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs v. the Inclusive Communities Project, holding that the Federal Housing Act allows for lawsuits based on so-called disparate impact claims\u2014while realizing that it is not nearly enough. With the passage of the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the federal government was obligated to not only combat residential segregation but also to actively promote integration. For the past 50 years, however, the FHA has largely been ignored or subverted by local governments , and federally led desegregation efforts have been forsaken. The court\u2019s ruling means that minority groups and individuals do not have to prove any actor\u2019s intent to discriminate, only that housing practices\u2014from renting to mortgage loans to tax credits for low-income housing development\u2014in their communities prevent them from leaving minority neighborhoods. In theory, the court just gave activists an important tool for breaking up concentrated poverty.\n\nHoping to combat concentrated poverty, the liberal establishment has championed policy initiatives aimed at breaking up these census tracts where more than 40 percent of residents live below the poverty line. Much of the language of scholarly articles and policy briefs emphasizes that poor people of color living together do not have access to the kind of power necessary to give their children better futures. Journalists, too , continue to imply that it is natural for concentrated-poverty neighborhoods to have bad schools, that the poor services stem from the poor economic conditions. In effect, rather than untangling the complicated causes of concentrated poverty, the liberal establishment blames concentrated poverty for the poor educational attainment of children and deficient child-rearing practices of adults. But this is a dangerous conceptual trend, because it validates the idea that wealth and power go hand in hand and that poverty, not an array of structural problems, is to blame for the disadvantages of being poor.\n\nWe should re-examine the terms in which we speak about helping the poor. We can start by tossing out concentrated poverty .\n\nToday, fewer Americans live in poverty than did in 1950, but the rate of extreme poverty, in which families live on less than $2 per day, has risen by 159 percent since the mid-1990s, according to one recent study . More than a fourth of black and Hispanic people in the country live in poverty, and most black people live in majority black neighborhoods where overall poverty rates tend to be much higher, no matter the income of the individual. Part of the liberal establishment\u2019s failure to address this problem stems from its inability to embrace truly progressive understandings of poverty. Those advocating for solutions to poverty rarely speak about the way our economy and social infrastructures entrench it. Rather, much of liberals\u2019 efforts have been crippled by unexamined and unchallenged beliefs that the spaces where poor people of color live are morally compromised, beliefs summed up by one well-intentioned but ultimately damaging term: concentrated poverty.\n\nIn addition to exposing the deplorable living conditions of the poor, Riis also stoked public fears of poor neighborhoods being hotbeds of immorality. In the decades after it first glimpsed this urban poverty in Riis\u2019s photographs, the liberal establishment watched as metropolitan areas around the country grew ever more segregated. By midcentury, with the aid of myriad government programs , the Other Half completed its metamorphosis from a multiethnic to an almost exclusively black urban underclass . The liberal establishment knew that segregation and poverty were inextricably linked, but its well-meaning fight against segregation remained hindered by racism that persists beyond the letter of the law.\n\nA quest to remedy poverty has animated a certain cross section of American society since Jacob Riis took his camera and flash bulb into the dank tenements of Manhattan and produced How the Other Half Lives in 1890. Let\u2019s call this cross section the liberal establishment.\n\n\u201cConcentrated poverty\u201d disproportionately befalls black Americans, and not even the deepest white poverty can compare. The term is shorthand for saying that we aren\u2019t just talking about people of little means but about a systematic lack of basic resources across very specific areas. They comprise voids across America\u2019s census tracts, where schools, jobs, police protection, banks, grocery stores, and hospitals greatly diminish in quality or simply disappear. This deprivation is so severe that its effects are nearly impossible to escape from generation to generation.\n\nBut this useful shorthand also cuts off the conceptual blood supply between cause and effect. When we blame \u201cconcentrated poverty\u201d for the diminished quality of life in minority neighborhoods, we are confusing that which creates poverty (namely racist policies and practices) and the conditions created by it.\n\nAn example of this conceptual confusion came days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall. Speaking on Sept. 15, 2005, as New Orleans began to recover, Democratic New York Rep. Charles Rangel (a liberal) praised David Brooks (not a liberal) for his column \u201cKatrina\u2019s Silver Lining\u201d on the House floor.\n\nPhoto by Mario Tama/Getty Images\n\n\u201cPoverty was the underlying cause of the tragedy that occurred in Louisiana a couple of weeks ago,\u201d said Rangel. He continued that people\u2019s poverty prevented many from escaping the flooding city and that Katrina provides a chance to eradicate that poverty.\n\nThis seems innocuous enough. Only now, almost 10 years later, is it apparent that to blame poverty for the fact that so many poor people did not receive adequate or timely help is circular at best. And we know that Katrina did not lead to the eradication of poverty, which persists in that city despite the disaster. Rather, it provided a chance to remove some of the poor.\n\nThe useful shorthand concentrated poverty cuts off the conceptual blood supply between cause and effect.\n\nBrooks\u2019 column, which characterized poor New Orleanians as uneducated criminals, inept mothers, and immoral womanizers, and which Rangel read in its entirety for the Congressional record, is a conceptual poisoned apple. In 750 words he connects the directive to \u201cbreak up zones of concentrated poverty,\u201d so attractive to the liberal establishment, to racist, pathological, Moynihanian stereotypes about black Americans.\n\nOn Rangel\u2019s lips, Brooks concludes that it was a blessing for poor black residents of New Orleans to lose their homes. This way they couldn\u2019t come back and live their collective pathologies together again.\n\nIn the wake of Katrina, affordable housing was not rebuilt in the city, and some public housing was eliminated. The public school system disappeared too, leading to the creation of the first all-charter school district in the nation. All this has made the city less accessible to poor people of color. In 2012, more than 100,000 fewer black Americans resided in New Orleans than in 2000.\n\nNon-hurricane-inspired solutions to the problems of concentrated poverty have long fallen into two camps: investing in such communities to raise living standards or moving poor minorities out to communities that are whiter and already enjoy those standards. Neither of these projects, in their limited implementations since the War on Poverty began, have been able to desegregate and deghettoize, likely because they target the symptoms and not the causes of poverty. The mobility programs in particular have done nothing to challenge the processes through which black spaces in this country have become unlivable.\n\nThe new Supreme Court decision will allow more minorities to move into wealthier, whiter communities, thus gaining access to the socioeconomic benefits of life therein. But housing mobility efforts, while beneficial for some individuals, only affirm the notion that there is something inherently wrong with black communities, that it is inevitable for them to be cut off from opportunities, and that to live a better life, black people either have to move out of their neighborhoods or white people have to move in.\n\nThe court\u2019s ruling is based on a case in which tax credits for low-income housing in Texas were allocated to poor, minority neighborhoods at disproportionally higher rates than to better-off white ones. This is exactly how public housing ghettos came to be decades earlier, when projects were built only in the poor, black neighborhoods from which their residents came. While it is commendable that the court recognizes the right to sue if tax-subsidized affordable housing does not appear outside of poor neighborhoods, another result of this decision could be a slowing or halt of affordable housing construction in Texas altogether, just as in the 1970s Chicago stopped building public housing after the Court said it had to build it in white neighborhoods, too. This is because this ruling, like the ones before it, does nothing to destigmatize blackness or poverty.\n\nUntil now, the fight against \u201cconcentrated poverty\u201d has essentially been a fight to give some poor people a chance to leave their neighborhoods. It has not been a fight against the behaviors of individuals, businesses, and governments that place innumerable hurdles in the path of a poor person of color trying to live a good, healthy, safe life.\n\nConcentrated poverty is not the cause of these hurdles; it is what happens when people get so exhausted that they cannot keep jumping. It is the legacy of discriminatory housing policies that deplete the tax bases of black neighborhoods. It\u2019s the predatory lending that creates debt rather than equity for black families. It\u2019s the budget cuts to schools in these neighborhoods that cause higher dropout rates. It\u2019s the erosion of full-time employment and benefits that causes the growth of elicit economies and racism in the criminal justice system that cuts off young black men from prospects of normal lives. Every one of these factors and more are tributaries trickling into concentrated poverty, and every one of them springs from decisions made by those in positions of influence and authority.", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:19:46.065+0000"}

Friday, Trump pointed to the death of a San Francisco woman, Kate Steinle, the victim of a random shooting by an undocumented worker, as proof of his claim.\n\nBush, several weeks after Trump\u2019s original remarks, joined a chorus of GOP voices distancing themselves from Trump. The former Florida governor said Trump\u2019s remarks were \u201cextraordinarily ugly\u201d and \u201cnot reflective of the Republican Party.\u201d Bush also speculated about Trump\u2019s motives. \u201cHe\u2019s doing this to inflame and incite and to draw attention, which seems to be the organizing principle of his campaign.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nTrump has been relentlessly critical of Bush, but this isn\u2019t just a slap fight between two rivals. Trump and Bush represent the opposite ends of the ideological spectrum on immigration in the 2016 nominating race. A year ago Bush said this about immigrants who came to America illegally:\n\nThe way I look at this is someone who comes to our country because they couldn\u2019t come legally, they come to our country because their families\u2014the dad who loved their children\u2014was worried that their children didn\u2019t have food on the table.

Yes, they broke the law, but it\u2019s not a felony. It\u2019s an act of love. It\u2019s an act of commitment to your family. I honestly think that that is a different kind of crime that there should be a price paid, but it shouldn\u2019t rile people up that people are actually coming to this country to provide for their families.\n\nIt is widely accepted that the Republican Party was hurt in the 2012 election when Mitt Romney said that immigrants in the United States illegally should \u201cself-deport.\u201d Romney himself says he paid politically in the general election for the remark and the idea behind it, which was that anti-immigrant policies would be so tough and life so miserable for immigrants that they\u2019d deport themselves.", "score": 2, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:19:54.401+0000"}

Conservative billionaire investor Foster Friess is leading the effort to stanch the infighting, according to the Associated Press, along with two fellow GOP powerbrokers, casino magnate Sheldon Adelson and Chicago Cubs co-owner Todd Ricketts.\n\nJosh Voorhees Josh Voorhees is a Slate senior writer. He lives in Iowa City.\n\n\u201cOur candidates will benefit if they all submit to Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment, 'Thou shall not speak ill of a fellow Republican,'\u201d Friess wrote to Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus in a letter obtained by the AP. \u201cWould you join the effort to inspire a more civil way of making their points? If they drift off the 'civility reservation,' let's all immediately communicate that to them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nThe fact that Adelson and Friess are calling for intra-party peace on the primary trail is ironic, considering their recent pasts. In 2012, they were the chief benefactors, respectively, of Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, both of who were highly critical of eventual nominee Mitt Romney. Gingrich, whose campaign was kept alive almost single-handedly by Adelson\u2019s millions, was probably the biggest perpetrator of the \u201cRepublican-on-Republican rhetorical violence\u201d that the megadonors now want to avoid. The former House speaker took a page out of the liberal playbook when he branded Romney a \u201cvulture capitalist,\u201d and repeatedly told voters that his rival thought they were \u201cstupid.\u201d Santorum, meanwhile, kept his slugfest with Romney going for about four months longer than anyone had expected coming into the 2012 nominating contest, during which he branded Romney \u201cthe ultimate flip-flopper\u201d and accused him of \u201clying to the American people\u201d about the healthcare overhaul he led as the governor of Massachusetts. Adelson and Friess\u2019 newfound appreciation for civility, though, is actually in line with how they\u2019ve suggested they\u2019ll approach 2016; they now appear more interested in backing a winner than picking a personal favorite.\n\nSo, will the Republican hopefuls listen to them? Don\u2019t bet on it. Even if the GOP\u2019s donor class were to make civility an explicit requirement of candidates who seek their support, the promise of millions in super PAC cash tomorrow means little to those candidates who need the spotlight today. And with the exception of Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, and Marco Rubio, the entire Republican field is desperate for attention. With less than a month until Fox News hands out 10 all-important invites to the first GOP debate, most candidates simply can\u2019t afford to play nice. When a single point in the polls could mean the difference between making it on the national stage and being left off of it, simply generating headlines becomes the name of the game. That\u2019s in large part why Lindsey Graham is attacking Rand Paul, why Paul is lashing out at pretty much everyone, and why Chris Christie has declared that Republicans don't need Ted Cruz's \u201clectures.\u201d Often the easiest way to the top of a pile is by pulling those above you down.\n\nThat dynamic would cause problems for a crowded field in a normal cycle, but it spells even more trouble in the current one given it includes a bizarrely coiffed carnival barker who refuses to be ignored. With Donald Trump currently riding high in the polls even an establishment frontrunner like Bush can\u2019t keep quiet. When The Donald pulls his I'm-not-saying-all-Mexicans-are-disease-ridden-rapists-but act, Bush can\u2019t claim to be the only adult in the race and abide by Reagan\u2019s 11th commandment, regardless of who\u2019s calling for calm. \u201cTo make these extraordinarily ugly kind of comments is not reflective of the Republican Party,\u201d Bush said in New Hampshire over the weekend after being asked about Trump, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s doing this to inflame and incite and to draw attention, which seems to be the organizing principle of his campaign.\u201d\n\nThe only way the GOP megadonors will get the relative civility they say they want would be if Fox News were to quit the round-the-clock promotion of Trump and join the can\u2019t-we-all-just-be-friends chorus. But that, of course, isn\u2019t going to happen. Not when conflict and chaos is good for ratings and when Trump is offering a worldview shared by a small but not insignificant sliver of the GOP base. In June alone, the cable network hosted Trump ten separate times for a total of 108 minutes\u2014more than any other candidate running for president.

At the time, many bakers were brutally overworked in unsanitary conditions, and they frequently fell victim to lung inflammation and rheumatism. To prevent bakery owners from straining their workers, New York barred bakers from working more than 10 hours a day or 60 hours a week.\n\nIn a 5\u20134 decision, the Supreme Court struck down the law as a violation of \u201cliberty of contract.\u201d Bakery workers, the majority wrote, have a constitutional right to work out individualized contracts with their bosses free of undue legislative meddling. If an employee wants to work more than 10 hours a day, he has a constitutional right to do so.\n\nAnd where, exactly, did this right come from? The Due Process Clause of the Fifth and 14th amendments declare that no person may be deprived of \u201clife, liberty, or property without due process of law.\u201d This \u201cliberty,\u201d the court wrote, includes the liberty of contract. And if a state wanted to interfere with that liberty, it had to prove its regulation to be \u201creasonable and appropriate\u201d and not \u201cunnecessary and arbitrary.\u201d\n\nThe problem with this theory is that courts are ridiculously unqualified to decide whether economic regulations are \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cunnecessary.\u201d When legislatures pass health and safety laws, they usually do so after extensive hearings and fact-findings. Members of the public and the targeted profession can petition for stricter or laxer regulations. If, in practice, the regulation is too burdensome or lenient, the state can adjust it. That is called legislating, and it is generally considered a job for the legislature.\n\nA Supreme Court ruling, on the other hand, is both clumsy and final. Justices can either uphold a regulation or invalidate it. And if they scrap it, the legislature has to try to pass a new law that might satisfy the whims of the court and its extremely dubious reading of the Constitution.\n\nWhat constitutes an \u201coppressive\u201d regulation? That\u2019s entirely for the Texas Supreme Court to decide.\n\nFor more than three decades, the Supreme Court used this \u201cliberty of contract\u201d justification to strike down progressive reforms and New Deal programs. Then, finally, in 1937, the court reversed itself, disavowing its laissez-faire constitutional doctrine. The court still enforces the \u201cliberty\u201d guaranteed by the Due Process Clause\u2014but now it protects only those fundamental rights relating to personal dignity and autonomy, which judges are much better at describing and defending. Justice Anthony Kennedy\u2019s marriage equality opinion, for instance, rests largely on the Due Process Clause, holding that decisions relating to marriage and intimacy are fundamental to the Constitution\u2019s conception of liberty.\n\nLike most state constitutions, the Texas Constitution contains a clause that\u2019s nearly identical to the Due Process Clause. For decades, the Texas Supreme Court interpreted this provision to give the legislature power to pass health and safety laws that were \u201crationally related to a legitimate government interest.\u201d That all stopped on June 26. Under the court\u2019s new doctrine, any economic regulation that is \u201cso unreasonably burdensome that it becomes oppressive\u201d is now invalid as a deprivation of economic liberty. And what constitutes an \u201coppressive\u201d regulation? That\u2019s entirely for the Texas Supreme Court to decide.\n\nTo see just how arbitrary and malleable this newly minted doctrine is, consider its application to Texas\u2019 threading law. Of the 750 hours of training threaders must undergo to become fully licensed, about 40 percent is not directly related to threading. That may be a problem\u2014but it is clearly a legislative problem, one that threaders could seek to solve through the democratic process by petitioning the legislature to reduce their training hours. Texas is not depriving threaders of any fundamental rights, like the right to vote or marry, which courts properly shield from popular prejudices.\n\nTexas regulates many professions that affect the public safety\u2014and how much training is too much? To take one example, Texas requires dental hygienists to undergo 15 hours of continuing education every year. North Carolina? Six hours\u2014every three years.\n\nWould the Texas Supreme Court strike down the dental hygienists\u2019 training rule as unconstitutionally oppressive? Don\u2019t bet against it. In a lengthy concurring opinion that is both charming and terrifying, Justice Don Willett\u2014Twitter\u2019s favorite judge\u2014argued that the court should be more tenacious about preserving Texas\u2019 \u201cspirit of daring and rugged independence\u201d by protecting \u201ceconomic dynamism.\u201d Texas\u2019 \u201cindustrious entrepreneurs,\u201d Willett writes, are imperiled by \u201cbureaucratic red tape\u201d and \u201cinterest-group politics.\u201d Too many \u201cirrational licensing laws,\u201d the justice explains, oppress \u201chard-working Texans\u201d who want \u201cto better their families through honest enterprise.\u201d Willett declares that occupational licensing is \u201coften less about protecting the public than about bestowing special privileges on political favorites.\u201d Thus, the court should fight back by striking whatever laws it deems to be \u201cnonsensical government encroachment\u201d on \u201ceconomic liberty.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:20:01.593+0000"}

{"entityId": 539, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Photo by Milos Bicanski/Getty Images\n\nWith this weekend's big \"no\" vote in its bailout referendum, Greece has edged ever closer to finally leaving the eurozone. Its government is heading to Brussels today for last-ditch negotiations with European leaders over a new rescue package. But with a deal far from sure and time ticking away, a Grexit is starting to feel \"more likely than not,\" as JPMorgan put it.\n\nAnd what would happen then? If only we knew. Breaking up with the euro would almost certainly involve some nasty short-term suffering for Greece. But economists disagree about whether the pain might one day be worth the payoff. In one camp you have Nobel Prize winners Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz, among others, who think that finally bidding goodbye to the common currency might actually be the country's best hope for reviving its depressed economy. In another, you have pessimists like the 246 economics professors from Greek universities who recently warned that doing so would lead to \"disastrous economic, social, political and geopolitical consequences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\n\nSince we lack an oracle to reveal what the future holds, I\u2019ve outlined possible best- and worst-case scenarios for Greece in the event of a Grexit. But first, you might be wondering \u2026\n\nWhat if Greece doesn\u2019t want to abandon the euro?\n\nIt might not have a choice. Greece can't technically be expelled from the eurozone. But it may have to bow out \u201cvoluntarily\u201d if the European Central Bank cuts off the emergency loans that are now keeping the Greek banking system from collapsing. Were that to happen, Athens would need to start printing money in order to bail out its financial sector. Since Greece can't legally print euros, it would have to print new drachmas instead.\n\nAnd we may well be approaching that endgame as Europe loses patience with Greece's left-wing government. After refusing to raise its current \u20ac89 billion ceiling on emergency lending over the weekend, the ECB took steps Monday that could theoretically make it more difficult for Greek banks to borrow, presumably to put more heat on Greece's negotiators. Should Athens default on a payment due to its European creditors later this month, it's plausible the central bank will close off the tap for good. It's also possible Greek banks will simply run out of cash in the coming days if the ECB just stands by and refuses to increase its cap on loans.\n\n\n\nIf Greece leaves, what's the best-case scenario?\n\nSome argue that finally ditching the euro would be a blessing in disguise. The thinking goes like this: European policymaking\u2014from its tight-fisted central banking philosophy to its demands for austerity\u2014has acted like a vice crushing the Greek economy, and at this point, any deal that would keep the country in the euro would only prolong the misery. Leaving would be difficult, but liberating. Greece would default on its European debts and introduce a new currency. The new drachma would depreciate quickly, giving the economy a shot of adrenaline by helping Greek businesses sell more exports\u2014who doesn\u2019t love good cheap olive oil?\u2014while luring more tourists to Santorini for affordable beach vacations. Yes, Greeks would see their bank accounts largely wiped out as their euro savings were converted into less valuable drachmas. And yes, prices of imported food, which Greeks rely on heavily, would rise. But there might be light at the end of the tunnel. As long as it's part of the euro, on the other hand, Greece's future is just a pitch-black slog with 25 percent unemployment.\n\n\"It\u2019s becoming hard to see any path that doesn\u2019t lead to Grexit,\" Krugman wrote recently. \"It is also, although this is still something few want to accept, becoming increasingly obvious that Grexit is Greece\u2019s best hope. Otherwise, where is recovery ever supposed to come from?\"\n\nGrexit enthusiasts, particularly Mark Weisbrot of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, often suggest that Greece could follow in the footsteps of Argentina, the poster child for surviving and even thriving after a massive default. In many ways, it's a seemingly tidy historical comparison. Much as Greece today finds itself stuck deep in debt with a depressed economy and a currency it can't control, during the 1990s Argentina tied its currency's value to the dollar, and later fell into a painful recession that forced it to accept a bailout from the International Monetary Fund in order to keep paying its creditors. But in 2001 and early 2002, the country changed course, defaulting on its loans and breaking the dollar peg, letting the peso fall in value.\n\nThe immediate aftermath was miserable\u2014the economy crashed hard, leaving more than half the country's urban population in poverty. Food prices skyrocketed. Imported medications became scarce. There were street protests and riots. But while the upheaval was violent, it was also relatively brief. Aided by its cheaper currency, Argentina's economy recovered by 2005, which allowed the country to sit down with lenders and restructure its debts. From there it posted years of strong growth.\n\n\u201cIt is worth noting that the social consequences of Argentina\u2019s recovery were enormous,\u201d Weisbrot wrote in 2012. \u201cEven though the economy had a brief downturn during the world recession in 2009, employment in Argentina is at record levels. Poverty and extreme poverty have been reduced by two-thirds, and social spending has nearly tripled in real terms, since the default.\u201d\n\nCould Greece pull off a similar feat? Maybe so.\n\nAll that sounds pretty good. But what's the worst-case scenario?\n\nImagine all the riots, drug shortages, and widespread destitution, but without Argentina's happy ending.\n\nBleak, right?\n\nAs James Stewart outlined at the New York Times, there are a number of reasons to think that a Greek euro exit wouldn't work out quite so well as Argentina's adventure with default. Perhaps most important of all: Argentina is a major agricultural power that was lucky enough to start its recovery just as a massive commodities boom, fueled by China's insatiable appetite, was taking off. Argentina exported a lot of soy and corn, which had the twin benefits of boosting growth directly while bringing much-needed foreign exchange into the country at a time when it was difficult for Argentina to access international capital markets.\n\nGreece, in contrast, is not a major exporter and may not be poised to become one, especially if it's forced out of the European Union and its trade pacts. Worse yet, as Stewart notes, its most important exports by far are refined petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel, which require imported crude to produce. Since oil is priced in dollars on the international market, a falling drachma wouldn't make Greek refiners much more competitive or profitable.\n\nMeanwhile, it's no sure thing that a cheap currency will help much with tourism, especially if there are mass protests mobbing the streets due to a financial crisis. Tear gas has a way of scaring off vacationers.\n\nWeisbrot argues that economists and journalists have overestimated the contribution that the worldwide commodity boom made to Argentina's recovery. The real reason the country began to grow so quickly after its crises, he believes, is that defaulting on its IMF debt and letting its currency float at market rates allowed the country to abandon austerity policies that were weighing it down, much as Greece is being suffocated today. But his theory has some notable critics, including Yanis Varoufakis, Greece's just-resigned firebrand finance minister, who called the idea that his country could \"pull off an Argentina\" \"profoundly wrong.\"\n\nGreece would have plenty of other issues to worry about aside from exports. Joseph Gagnon of the Peterson Institute for International Economics notes that Greek corporations and banks will still owe debts denominated in euros, which will become harder to pay as the drachma devalues, possibly leading to bankruptcies. Meanwhile, if the government decides to reverse the spending cuts it's made in recent years and run a deficit, it will likely have to finance it by printing money, which could lead to severe inflation. This is to say nothing of the more mundane but significant technical challenges of introducing a whole new currency, which is more complicated than simply breaking a peg. As University of California\u2013Berkeley economist Barry Eichengreen wrote years ago while speculating about a potential breakup of the euro, \u201cComputers will have to be reprogrammed. Vending machines will have to be modified. Payment machines will have to be serviced to prevent motorists from being trapped in subterranean parking garages.\u201d\n\nThen, of course, there's the question of Greece's debts to Europe, which won't necessarily disappear, even if the government stops paying them back. Economists Carmen Reinhart, of Harvard University's Kennedy School, told me that could make it difficult for Greece to find new buyers for its debt in the future. She and Christoph Trebesch, of the University of Munich, have found that in the wake of sovereign defaults, countries tend to start growing fairly quickly and regain their credit ratings\u2014but typically only once they've restructured their old loans and resolved whether and how much they will repay their lenders.\n\n\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like a wet rag, but I think the prospects of growth without resolution of the debt situation are very limited with and without a euro,\" Reinhart told me. \"You\u2019re not going to have potential new creditors lining up to make new loans to Greece when the rules of the game are just not known.\"", "score": 1, "label": "Democrat"}, "event": "articles", "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:20:24.658+0000"}
