He will be part of Fox News\u2019 primetime debate with the top 10 candidates on Aug. 6 in Cleveland. Fiorina is one of six candidates in the preliminary debate that will be held that same day at 5 p.m.\n\nAn initial demand for an outsider isn\u2019t new in a presidential race: Ross Perot\u2019s independent candidacy caught fire in 1992, and outsider businessmen candidates like Steve Forbes in 1996 and Herman Cain in the 2012 polled strongly for a time, before fizzling.\n\nCarson believes 2016 will be a breakthrough year, when an outsider is elected to the White House.\n\n\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen as I travel the country and see the size of the crowds and the enthusiasm of the crowds, I do believe this is the breakthrough year,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what Thomas Jefferson said. He said just before we turn into another form of government, the people would awaken and they would regain control. I certainly hope this is it.\u201d\n\nCarson on Wednesday took a further stance against the Washington political class, signing the \u201cU.S. term limits\u201d pledge to advocate for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on members of Congress.\n\n\u201cWhen our Constitution was put together, and reflected a republic type of government, representatives of the people, conditions were not cushy by any stretch of the imagination,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSo, nobody even expected somebody to want to do it more than once.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, it has morphed into something very different now with lots of power, good salary, all kinds of supports and perks,\u201d he continued. \u201cTherefore, we need to rethink this. There are a lot of reforms we need to rethink. We do have to adjust with the times. So this, I think, is just a natural adjustment, given what\u2019s happened in Washington, D.C. \u201c\n\nCarson also talked about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton who, as a former secretary of state, senator and first lady, is no political outsider.\n\nFellow Republican 2016 candidate and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) called for Clinton to return her campaign donations from Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s largest abortion provider, after undercover videos were released showing officials discussing selling aborted fetal body parts.\n\nCarson said he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary for Clinton to return the money, considering her allegiance with the group\n\n\u201cI think Hillary Clinton should be Hillary Clinton,\u201d Carson said. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen so far, she is a political animal with a very different value system than I have. I think that works well because if I am the nominee the contrast between us will be very substantial. The people will not have to scratch their heads and try to figure out which way to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cObviously, Hillary Clinton proclaims great admiration for Margaret Sanger, who founded Planned Parenthood, who was a racist and believed in eugenics,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t understand, quite frankly, how she could be supportive of that if she is who she claims to be. If in fact she finds that acceptable, then she would obviously find accepting money from them acceptable.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:43:38.913+0000", "event": "articles"}

The mahogany-paneled, McClelland\u2019s scotch and rum and \u2018Mad Men\u2019 world is disappearing \u2026 as they struggle to figure out the altered parameters of manliness and resist becoming house-dudes.\u201d She ended her statement with a quote from comedian Sarah Silverman: \u201cDear men, just because we don\u2019t need you anymore doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t want you. Love forever, women.\u201d\n\nIf leftists, who prefer to use males as punching bags, had their way, men would take this as their cue to hang up their manhood, bow their heads and make way for a new social order that has no place for traditional masculinity. First lady Michele Obama got into the act when she explained that \u201cwomen are smarter than men\u201d at an August women\u2019s forum. Her statement was met with laughter from the crowd. She then added that the men in the audience \u201ccan\u2019t complain because you\u2019re outnumbered today.\u201d\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nThe NBA\u2019s first-ever female union leader, former trial attorney Michele Roberts, shared her aggressive attitude toward men to the male-only union that elected her to represent them: \u201cMy past is littered with the bones of men who were foolish enough to think I was someone they could sleep on.\u201d\n\nIn a column titled \u201cMen, Who Needs Them?,\u201d New York Times\u2019 op-ed contributor Greg Hampikian wrote, \u201cIf all the men on earth died tonight, the species could continue on frozen sperm. If the women disappear, it\u2019s extinction.\u201d\n\nA January feature in Time declared, \u201cMen Are Obsolete.\u201d Feminist Hanna Rosin argued in the piece that men are done in the way that \u201cwe\u2019ve historically come to define them\u2014entitled to power, destined for leadership, arrogant, confused by anything that isn\u2019t them. \u2026 They are obsolete.\u201d\n\nWho needs a \u201cWar on Women\u201d when there is already a war on men?\n\nBeing a man in today\u2019s America is not as simple or straightforward as it once was. Historically, boys knew that when they grew up they were expected to provide for a wife and family. While men were responsible for earning an income for the family, the women were to maintain the household and nurture the children. This basic pattern spans thousands of years of human history. But in the last 40 years, the role of women has vastly changed (as has their station), and they are now a powerful part of the American workforce. For better or for worse, feminists have been outspoken advocates for this transition, which has offered women a support system to wade through these changes.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nBut it has been a different story for men.\n\nExcept for the fact that their honor has been under attack, men have largely been ignored. Men have been told that they are disposable and akin to an accessory.\n\n[...]\n\nFEMINISM\u2019S IMPACT\n\nToday\u2019s radical feminism was born from Marxism. And its disciples believe that, in order to establish a Marxist society, men need to be marginalized.\n\nA vivid example of this is found in feminist scholars Daphne Patai and Noretta Koertge\u2019s book, \u201cProfessing Feminism: Cautionary Tales From the Strange World of Women\u2019s Studies.\u201d In it they contend, \u201cFeminist theory provides a doctrine of original sin: The world\u2019s evils originate in male supremacy. It regards the male\u2019s (usually: the white male\u2019s) insistence on maintaining his own power as the passkey that unlocks the mysteries of individual actions and institutional behavior. And it offers a prescription for radical change that is as simple as it is drastic: Reject whatever is tainted with patriarchy and replace it with something embodying gynecentric values.\u201d\n\nRadical leftist and author Sharon Smith put it plainly at the Socialism 2012 conference in Chicago. \u201cThere is a simple reason why the upper echelons of the corporate and political world are still overwhelmingly white and male, and that is because of racism and sexism, pure and simple,\u201d Smith announced. \u201cWe have a white, male inner circle running society, and blacks and women just don\u2019t get invited in.\u201d\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nWhat may be most sobering is the very real detrimental impact that radical feminism is having on men. Women have earned nearly 10 million more college degrees than men since 1982, according to the Department of Education. A study by Reach Advisors found that in most major cities the average median income for single, childless women between 22 and 30 was 8 percent higher than that of their male counterparts. Today, 24 percent of wives earn more than their husbands\u2014four times greater than in the 1960s. And the U.S. Census Bureau reports that between 1970 and 2010 the median earnings of men fell 19 percent.\n\nWhile these achievements among women should be recognized, some of those gains for women came at a serious cost to millions of innocent men, not the least of which is the ripple effect that has gone largely unexamined. Perhaps clinical psychiatrist Paul Dobransky, M.D. put it best when he wrote in Psychology Today, \u201cMen know women are powerful, and we don\u2019t mind that one bit. It empowers us that you\u2019re empowered. Unless, that is, you disempower us in order to feel empowered.\u201d\n\nAuthor Suzanne Venker\u2019s \u201cThe Flipside of Feminism: What Conservative Women Know and Men Can\u2019t Say\u201d takes a similar tack, explaining, \u201cWhen women usurp men\u2019s role in society, as they do now, it messes up the order of things. Most men don\u2019t want to compete with the women they love; they want to take care of them. It makes men feel important and boosts their self-esteem.\u201d\n\nTraditionally, according to Dr. Warren Farrell, author of \u201cThe Myth of Male Power,\u201d men could generate a sense of purpose in three ways: preparing for war, preparing for work and being a father who provides for and protects his family. Today, men are largely not being trained for war and \u201cbeing a sole breadwinner is no longer synonymous with masculinity.\u201d\n\nSo how do today\u2019s boys envision themselves as future dads?\n\n[...]\n\n********************************\n\nWant answers?

(AP) \u2014 Promising to fight what he deems \u201cobscene levels\u201d of income disparity and a campaign finance system that is a \u201creal disgrace,\u201d independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said Wednesday he will run for president as a Democrat.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Sanders confirmed his plans to formally join the race Thursday.\n\nMONTPELIER, Vt. (@AP) \u2014 Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders says 'I am running for president' in interview with AP. \u2014 TheBlazeNOW (@TheBlazeNOW) April 30, 2015\n\nThe self-described \u201cdemocratic socialist\u201d enters the race as a robust liberal alternative to Hillary Rodham Clinton, and he pledged to do more than simply raise progressive issues or nudge the former secretary of state to the left in a campaign in which she is heavily favored.\n\n\u201cPeople should not underestimate me,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI\u2019ve run outside of the two-party system, defeating Democrats and Republicans, taking on big-money candidates and, you know, I think the message that has resonated in Vermont is a message that can resonate all over this country.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople should not underestimate me.\u201d Share:\n\nAs he has for months in prospective campaign stops in the early voting states, and throughout his political career, the former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, on Wednesday assailed an economic system that he said has devolved over the past 40 years and eradicated the nation\u2019s middle class.\n\n\u201cWhat we have seen is that while the average person is working longer hours for lower wages, we have seen a huge increase in income and wealth inequality, which is now reaching obscene levels,\u201d Sanders told the AP.\n\n\u201cThis is a rigged economy, which works for the rich and the powerful, and is not working for ordinary Americans. \u2026 You know, this country just does not belong to a handful of billionaires.\u201d\n\nThe son of an immigrant from Poland who sold paint for a living in Brooklyn, Sanders has for decades championed working-class Americans. He lost several statewide races in the 1970s before he was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981, and went on to represent Vermont in the U.S. House for 16 years before his election to the Senate in 2006.\n\nAn independent in the Senate, he caucuses with Democrats in Washington and he is likely to attract some interest from voters who have unsuccessfully sought to draft Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to join the race.\n\nBut Sanders rejected the idea his appeal is limited to voters on the left, boldly predicting Wednesday that his message would appeal to both fellow independents and Republicans.\n\nSanders said he would release \u201cvery specific proposals\u201d to raise taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations, as well as offer tuition-free education at all public colleges and universities. He touched on his past opposition to free-trade agreements, his support for heavier regulations of Wall Street and the nation\u2019s banking industry, and his vote against the Keystone XL oil pipeline as a preview of his campaign.\n\n\u201cSo to me, the question is whose views come closer to representing the vast majority of working people in this country,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd you know what? I think my views do.\u201d\n\nThe 73-year-old Sanders starts his campaign as an undisputed underdog against Clinton. Sanders said he has known the former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state for more than two decades. \u201cI respect her and like her,\u201d he said.\n\nHe noted he has \u201cnever run a negative ad in my life,\u201d but still drew a distinction with Clinton in the interview, promising to talk \u201cvery strongly about the need not to get involved in perpetual warfare in the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cI voted against the war in Iraq,\u201d he said. \u201cSecretary Clinton voted for it when she was in the Senate.\u201d\n\nClinton is hosting a series of fundraisers this week, starting what could be an effort that raises more than $1 billion. Sanders said he will make money and politics a central theme of his campaign, including a call for a constitutional amendment to overturn the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 Citizens United decision, which he blames for unleashing a torrent of money from wealthy donors into politics.\n\n\u201cWhat you\u2019re looking at here is a real disgrace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is an undermining of American democracy.\n\n\u201cBut can we raise the hundreds of millions of dollars that we need, primarily through small campaign contributions to run a strong campaign? And I have concluded that I think there is a real chance that we can do that.\u201d\n\nSanders is the first major challenger to enter the race against Clinton, who earlier this month became the first Democrat to formally declare her intention to run for president. He is likely to be joined in the coming months by former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and ex-Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.\n\n\u2014", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:43:57.666+0000", "event": "articles"}

Martin O\u2019Malley, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chaffee have expressed interest in entering the Democratic primary, and Vice President Joe Biden has not ruled out another bid of his own. Many progressives have pushed for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to enter the race, despite her repeated denials that she will run.\n\nClinton\u2019s populist comment about how \u201cthe deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,\u201d suggests she is reaching out early to would-be Warren supporters.\n\nClinton\u2019s online presence quickly underwent a revamp Sunday afternoon, including taking out the teasing \u201cTBD\u201d from her Twitter bio and replacing it with \u201c2016 presidential candidate.\u201d\n\nShe is set to make her first official campaign appearance in Iowa, the early presidential contest state where she faired poorly in 2008, and where a new Quinnipiac University poll has her essentially in a dead heat with several potential Republican rivals.\n\nA separate Gallup poll found that Clinton\u2019s favorability rating is at its lowest point in seven years, standing at 48 percent. A year ago, her favorability was 59 percent.\n\nClinton came in third in Iowa in 2008, losing to then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. She came back to win the New Hampshire primary and move forward in a prolonged Democratic contest against Obama before ultimately dropping out and endorsing him, then going on to serve one term as his secretary of state.\n\nAside from fighting her rivals running for the White House, Clinton will also have to fend off what has become a sort of permanent machinery against her in Congress in the form of an ongoing investigation into her role in the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, that left four Americans dead.\n\nThere are also the matters of her conducting government communications through a private server, and the millions of dollars from foreign governments and foreign donations that flowed into the Clinton Foundation while she was running the State Department \u2014 in violation of an ethics agreement she signed when she joined the Obama administration.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), who chairs the House Select Committee on Benghazi, said last month he wants Clinton to testify on her decision to use her personal email while in office, and then the decision to delete thousands of those emails on her own without any oversight from the government on which emails should have been archived as part of her work record.\n\nThe email matter has already become a problem for Clinton, as many pundits have said it reinforces the view among many that both she and her husband routinely act as if the rules don\u2019t apply to them.\n\nThe Republican National Committee seized on that perception Sunday, saying Clinton has \u201cleft a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed policies\u201d during her \u201cdecades as a Washington insider\u201d and brought up both the email and foreign donations issues.\n\n\u201cAmericans need a president they can trust and voters do not trust Hillary Clinton. Over decades as a Washington insider, Clinton has left a trail of secrecy, scandal and failed policies that can\u2019t be erased from voters\u2019 minds,\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Preibus said in a statement. \u201cThe Clintons believe they can play by a different set of rules and think they\u2019re above transparency, accountability, and ethics. Our next president must represent a higher standard, and that is not Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nGowdy also wants Clinton to testify on her efforts to keep Americans safe in Benghazi, and on how she reacted to the attack. Republicans have said Clinton and others in the Obama administration initially tried to play off the attack as a spontaneous reaction to an anti-Muslim video, instead of a planned terrorist attack.\n\nRepublicans have also pushed the Obama administration to investigate Clinton for her use of personal email. Earlier this month, Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) asked Attorney General nominee Loretta Lynch if she would investigate Clinton if she is confirmed.\n\nBeyond the Benghazi attacks, Clinton will have to deal with further scrutiny of her record as secretary of state. She reached out to Syrian President Bashar Assad and was the chief figure supporting the \u201creset button\u201d with Russia \u2013 all of which will be cast as failures by Republicans and also possibly by her Democratic opponents.\n\nOn the other hand, Clinton can also point out that she was part of the national security team that oversaw the operation to kill Osama bin Laden, while she also led the way for a nuclear missile reduction treaty with Russia, known as the START treaty.\n\nIn recent weeks, Clinton\u2019s likely Democratic rivals have stepped up in criticism of her, first with O\u2019Malley calling for more answers about her email; Webb criticizing her foreign policy as secretary of state; and Chafee saying her 2002 support for the Iraq War disqualifies her from being president.\n\nShe did receive a boost from Obama on the eve of her announcement: In Panama on Saturday, he told reporters he thinks Clinton \u201cwould be an excellent president.\u201d\n\nPete Kasperowicz and Madeleine Morgenstern contributed to this report.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:43:59.853+0000", "event": "articles"}

Barack Obama called the $9 trillion under then-President George W. Bush \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cunpatriotic.\u201d When Obama came to office, the national debt was $10.6 trillion.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office said earlier this year that on the debt is 74 percent of the gross domestic product, and is on the path to reach 106 percent of the GDP by 2039. The CBO said that 74 percent is the highest amount of debt held by the public since 1950. Debt was 39 percent of the GDP in 2008.\n\nThe national debt reached the milestone of $18 trillion on Friday, according to the Treasury Department. As TheBlaze previously reported, that was a jump of about $40 billion from two days earlier. The Thanksgiving holiday wasn\u2019t counted in the Treasury Department chart.\n\n\u201cThe thing that has attracted so much attention from both critics of the administration and some deficit hawks in the last couple of years was the concerns shared by both Democrats and Republicans about the growth in the short term deficit,\u201d Earnest told TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cWe cut the deficit by two-thirds since the president took office,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s the fastest sustained rate of deficit reduction since the end of World War II. We\u2019ve made tremendous progress on this.\u201d\n\nThe fiscal year 2009 deficit was $1.4 trillion. That came amid the economic downturn climbing significantly from the $458 billion deficit in fiscal year 2008. The fiscal year 2015 deficit is projected $564 billion, up from $483 billion in fiscal year 2014.\n\nThe national debt is how much the government has borrowed. The federal deficit is how much more the government is spending outpaces revenue.\n\n\u201cIn the context of these debates, many advocates were talking about the need to lower our deficits to below 3 percent of GDP. I can tell you last year the deficit was 2.8 percent of GDP,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThat very ambitious goal that many deficit hawks did not believe could be achieved has been attained in a much quicker time period than was previously believed possible.\u201d\n\nWhen campaigning for president on July 3, 2008 in Fargo, N.D., Obama criticized the Bush debt.\n\n\u201cThe problem is, is that the way Bush has done it over the last eight years is to take out a credit card from the Bank of China in the name of our children, driving up our national debt from $5 trillion for the first 42 presidents \u2013 number 43 added $4 trillion by his lonesome, so that we now have over $9 trillion of debt that we are going to have to pay back, $30,000 for every man, woman and child,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s irresponsible. It\u2019s unpatriotic.\u201d\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus called the $18 trillion national debt a \u201csad milestone\u201d for America.\n\n\u201cBy his own reasoning then, President Obama has reached a new level of irresponsibility,\u201d Priebus said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cHe has the worst record of any president when it comes to putting America deeper in debt. Spending more money than we have is immoral; it hurts future generations who will be left to pay off the bills.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:44:06.101+0000", "event": "articles"}

Yet Trump led the poll with 23 percent, besting the the runner-up \u2014 Sen. Ted Cruz \u2014 with 13 percent.\n\nAnd on Sunday, he was back, splashed across the weekend news shows, dismissing the latest firestorm to consume his campaign and explaining how he cherishes women and would be their strongest advocate if elected. \u201cI\u2019m leading by double digits, so maybe I shouldn\u2019t change,\u201d he boasted.\n\nThe latest controversy started Thursday night when Fox News\u2019 Kelly recounted Trump\u2019s history of incendiary comments toward women. Angry over what he considered unfair treatment at the debate, Trump told CNN on Friday night that Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d\n\nThe remark cost Trump a prime-time speaking slot at the RedState Gathering, the Atlanta conference where several other presidential candidates spoke to about 1,000 conservative activists.\n\nBut Trump refused to back down, insisting Sunday that only \u201ca deviant\u201d would interpret his comment beyond a harmless barb.\n\n\u201cI apologize when I\u2019m wrong, but I haven\u2019t been wrong. I said nothing wrong,\u201d said Trump, who spoke to four Sunday news shows, skipping only Fox News, the network with which he is feuding.\n\nThe flap is just the latest from Trump\u2019s unconventional, insurgent campaign, which has excited many anti-establishment conservatives while confounding party leaders already facing the prospects of a bruising fight among 17 candidates.\n\nSome have responded by sharpening their critiques, questioning Trump\u2019s electability, his conservative credentials, policy ideas and personality.\n\nFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, the only woman running for the GOP nomination, appeared most adept at seizing on the comments as she strives to break into the top 10.\n\n\u201cI think women of all kinds are really sort of horrified by this,\u201d she said, arguing that there was a difference between being politically incorrect and insulting.\n\nShe also questioned Trump\u2019s suitability for office, suggesting the businessman may be unprepared for the pressure that comes with being president.\n\n\u201cI think you cannot have a president who is thin-skinned.

I have no idea what his real philosophy is, other than that he is for promoting himself.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush, the presidential favorite for many top Republican donors, said at RedState that Trump\u2019s bombast would hurt the GOP\u2019s chances with women, who already tilt toward Democrats in presidential elections. \u201cDo we want to win? Do we want to insult 53 percent of all voters?\u201d the former Florida governor asked.\n\nOther candidates bemoaned the challenge of preaching their message when all their precious free TV time is spent being asked about Trump.\n\n\u201cAt this point, I mean, we\u2019ve got to focus on our message.

On Sunday, he took a more measured approach.\n\n\u201cI think the rest of us are doing what we\u2019re supposed to do and that\u2019s focus on getting a message out, which is sometimes hard to do because all the air in the balloon is going to Donald Trump right now,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump, who has refused to rule out a third party run if he falls short of the GOP nomination, was asked about those Republicans wondering what it will take to get him out of their party. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything.

Mandatory deportation of all \u201ccriminal aliens.\u201d Tripling the force of immigration officers by eliminating tax credit payments to immigrant families residing illegally in the U.S.\n\nHe said that families with U.S.-born children could return quickly if deemed worthy by the government. \u201cWe\u2019re going to try and bring them back rapidly, the good ones,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe will expedite it so people can come back in.

Still, Sam Pimm, executive director of the Run Ben Run super PAC, and veteran of Republican campaigns, understands why pundits and even voters might not be sure about the doctor\u2019s electability.\n\nPimm points to a strong outpouring of support and strong organization of volunteers going door-to-door and making phone calls already on board. He is counting on that grassroots support to propel Carson ahead in early states to gain more support.\n\n\u201cMy answer to that is that if Carson can break through in early primaries, then the people who like him will be ready to jump on board,\u201d Pimm told TheBlaze.\n\nThe super PAC is a continuation of the draft committee that gained 500,000 signatures to encourage Carson to enter the campaign. This is phase two of that, Pimm said. It is separate from the campaign.\n\nDespite the perception of an underdog status, Carson, a famed neurosurgeon, has consistently been a top tier candidate in national polls.\n\nThis week, a Monmouth University Poll, showed Carson even led every GOP candidate by a slim margin in one poll.

{"entityId": 50, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden left the seclusion of the Delaware home where he\u2019s been weighing a presidential run to meet Saturday with Elizabeth Warren \u2014 another influential Democrat who has faced calls to enter the 2016 race.\n\nThe unusual weekend huddle with Warren, a Massachusetts senator, took place at the Naval Observatory, the vice president\u2019s official residence, said an individual familiar with the meeting. An Obama administration official said Biden had traveled at the last minute to Washington for a private meeting and planned to return to Delaware the same day. Both of the individuals spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the meeting publicly.\n\nBiden\u2019s meeting with Warren was the latest sign that the vice president is seriously considering entering the race, and that he\u2019s increasingly discussing it with Democratic leaders outside of his small cadre of longtime advisers.\n\nA rising star in the party, Warren was the subject of an intense lobbying campaign by a group called Draft Warren that sought to persuade her to enter the race. Warren ruled out running in 2016, and a super PAC similarly named Draft Biden later emerged and has been laying the groundwork for a potential Biden candidacy.\n\nWarren, a vocal advocate for economic fairness and Wall Street reform, has notably refrained from endorsing Hillary Rodham Clinton, Sen. Bernie Sanders or the other candidates. She retains the vocal support of many in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, making her endorsement one of the most highly sought in the primary.\n\nBiden\u2019s quick trip to Washington wasn\u2019t on his official public schedule, which listed him as remaining in Delaware through Sunday. He\u2019s spent the past several days at his home in a secluded, wooded suburb of Wilmington spending time with family \u2014 but also meeting with his longtime political aides to assess what it would take to launch a viable presidential campaign against well-funded Democratic opponents with a huge head start.\n\nSpending time with Biden in Delaware has been longtime Biden confidantes Mike Donilon and former Sen. Ted Kaufman, along with his sister, Valerie Owens Biden, who has played a top role in all his previous campaigns. The Associated Press first reported on the Delaware meeting, while CNN first disclosed the session with Warren.\n\nAlthough Biden has yet to make a decision, his advisers have started gaming out mechanics like fundraising, ballot deadlines and an early primary state strategy. Another key consideration is the personal consequences for Biden and his family, who are still mourning the death of the vice president\u2019s son, Beau Biden, a few months ago.\n\nA look at the deliberations:\n\nTIMING\n\nBiden\u2019s team has settled on a one-month window in September in which he could potentially announce plans to run.\n\nThe longer he waits, the less time he has to build a formidable campaign. But competing events on the administration\u2019s calendar make it difficult to launch in the next couple of weeks, making it more likely an announcement would wait until late September, aides said.\n\nIf Biden\u2019s not in by Oct. 1, it will be increasingly difficult for him to run, people who have spoken to Biden recently said. He\u2019ll need at least two full months to get the petition signatures and delegates lined up by the beginning of December to qualify for the ballot in early primary states.\n\nBiden\u2019s aides are also eyeing the first Democratic primary debate \u2014 on Oct. 13 \u2014 as potentially a make-or-break moment. That first debate is expected to attract a huge audience among Democratic primary voters, giving Biden a powerful opportunity to establish himself as a credible alternative to Clinton.\n\nMONEY\n\nClinton and Sanders have already amassed millions of dollars while securing support from many of the party\u2019s top fundraisers.\n\nWith that reality in mind, his political advisers have discussed $5 million in hard money \u2014 direct campaign contributions \u2014 as a bare minimum of what they\u2019d likely need in the first two months to open campaign offices and compete in the first primary contests. Separately, Draft Biden has set a goal to raise $2.5 million to $3 million in the next six or so weeks.\n\nAs a super PAC, Draft Biden is exempt from contribution limits, and could pay for pro-Biden television advertising. But the trappings of his current job make campaigning extremely expensive for Biden. When the vice president travels for political events, his campaign has to reimburse the government for much of the cost of Air Force Two.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Biden could attract enough major donors and bundlers to fund a competitive campaign. After all, many of the party\u2019s top fundraisers are already committed to Clinton.\n\nTHE MAP\n\nAiming to prove Biden would be competitive in key primary states, Draft Biden has been organizing and recruiting Democratic talent in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. This week Steve Schale, who ran Obama\u2019s presidential campaign in Florida, joined the super PAC, becoming the most senior Obama campaign staffer to publicly support a Biden run.\n\nBiden\u2019s team has said it\u2019s optimistic about South Carolina, which holds the third primary contest and where Biden has deep political roots. Aiming to lock up support there, Clinton\u2019s campaign has dispatched top advisers John Podesta and James Carville to campaign for her in South Carolina.\n\nIn a bout of encouraging news for Biden this week, a Quinnipiac University poll of three battleground states \u2014 Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 found Biden faring as well as or better than Clinton against the top Republican candidates. In Ohio, 48 percent said they\u2019d support Biden over Republican Donald Trump, giving Biden a 10-point lead over the GOP front-runner.\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n(H/T: Drudge Report)\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Dave Urbanski (@DaveVUrbanski) on Twitter", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:44:28.306+0000", "event": "articles"}

The first Muslims came to America as a result of the Muslims capturing them and sending them to the Dutch traders.\u201d\n\nBarton said that beyond their heavy involvement in the slave trade, America was at war with the Barbary pirates shortly after the founding of the country, but those were \u201cthe two biggest contributions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the fabric,\u201d Beck said with heavy sarcasm. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s practically the whole blanket.\u201d\n\nBarton added that there were a number of Muslims whose activities were recorded in the 1800\u2032s, but it might be a stretch to say they are part of the \u201cfabric of the country.\u201d One such Muslim helped the American military raise camels, he said.\n\n\u201cIn 1856 the American military is engaged in all sorts of Indian wars in western lands,\u201d Barton explained. \u201cThe secretary of war at that time was Jefferson Davis. Five years later, he would become part of the secession and the president of the Confederacy. But at that time, he\u2019s secretary of war.

You\u2019re selling people into slavery. You\u2019re saying you can use woman any way you want. America, it doesn\u2019t look like we have many standards, but we have a few basic standards. Slavery is wrong. Sexual slavery is wrong. Beheading people is wrong. Forcing them to submit to your ideology is wrong. And America will stand united on that, and we\u2019re coming for you.

We do not want part of your religious war,\u201d Beck concluded. \u201cYou are trying to separate the Middle East, Sunni against Shia. You are trying to take over the movement of a once great and powerful religion, one that gave the world so much. \u2026 We have no fight with the Muslim people. But you want to bring it to our shores, you want to bring it to our people, you want to bring it to our journalists? Make no mistake: we will pound you into glass.

This happened before Franken was selected to the U.S. Senate.\n\n\u201cI have tremendous respect for McCain but I don\u2019t buy the war hero thing,\u201d Franken said at the time. \u201cAnybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I\u2019m concerned he sat out the war.\u201d\n\nFranken\u2019s thoughts were part of a post on Salon.com in January of 2000 in a story titled, \u201cWhat\u2019s at Stake in the 2000 Elections?\u201d\n\nTheBlaze reached out to Senator Franken\u2019s office for comment about the last paragraph. His press secretary, Michael Dale-Stein, responded by saying it was all for fun.\n\n\u201cIt was a joke, one that Sen. Franken told Sen. McCain when he was a guest on Sen. Franken\u2019s radio show in 2004, during which he also called Sen. McCain a hero with tremendous political courage,\u201d Dale-Sten told TheBlaze.\n\nNoting that the original statement was from a print story from 2000, we asked Dale-Stein for additional clarification. \u201cThat line in the Salon piece was a joke; a joke that Senator Franken repeated to Senator McCain in 2004 on Air America,\u201d the press secretary said.\n\nFranken\u2019s office provided the following transcript from the 2004 radio interview, as well as a clip of another time the senator used the same language in his book, \u201cLies: And the Lying Liars Who Tell Them.\u201d\n\nDuring the 2008 campaign cycle, Retired U.S. Army General Wesley Clark appeared on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation as a surrogate for Barack Obama. Clark did use the word \u201chero\u201d to describe McCain\u2019s POW experience, stating, \u201dI certainly honor his service as a prisoner of war. He was a hero to me and to hundreds of thousands and millions of others in the armed forces, as a prisoner of war.\u201d\n\nBut Clark also made a statement about how the Arizona senator ended up a prisoner of war.\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think riding in a fighter plane and getting shot down is a qualification to be president,\u201d Clark told CBS\u2019 Bob Schieffer.\n\nWatch the video:\n\nAlso from 2008, after the primaries were decided and Barack Obama was facing John McCain in the general election, comic Chris Rock tore into McCain during one of his comedy specials.\n\nRock mocked McCain\u2019s age (he was 72 years old at the time), and then talked about McCain\u2019s five and a half years as a POW.\n\n\u201cHe a war hero. He a war hero. He a war hero that got captured,\u201d Rock said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lotta guys in jail that got captured. I don\u2019t wanna vote for the guy that got captured.

Stewart, citing security concerns, says the campaign will provide details of the \u201cbrief trip\u201d only after Huckabee returns.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s trip comes just weeks after he drew international headlines for declaring that the deal \u201cis marching the Israelis to the door of the oven.\u201d Several American Jewish politicians, the Anti-Defamation League and some Israeli leaders chided Huckabee for the Holocaust reference.

And she picked up on that, saying there is \u201csomething wrong\u201d when hedge fund managers pay lower tax rates than typical workers and when students and their families are forced into debt to pay for education and skills training.\n\nAlthough she is running in what is expected to be the most expensive election in history, Clinton embraced the idea of a constitutional amendment, if that\u2019s what it takes, to address the Supreme Court decision removing campaign-finance obstacles for big-money interests.\n\nClinton is opening her campaign with small events such as the community college meeting and leaving big rallies for later.\n\nFresh from a two-day road trip from New York, Clinton visited a coffee ship in the Mississippi River town of LeClaire in the morning.\n\nHer 2016 debut is reminiscent of the \u201clistening tour\u201d that opened her 1999 campaign for a New York Senate seat, when she ventured into small upstate towns to convene meetings with voters and local leaders.\n\nIn Iowa, Clinton aims to overcome her disappointing third-place finish in the 2008 caucuses.\n\nHer events Tuesday and Wednesday focus heavily on pocketbook economic issues in small-town Iowa, and Clinton was expected to connect with local officials, community leaders and Democratic activists.\n\nAt the LeClaire coffee shop earlier she ordered a Masala chai and a Carmellow latte, along with some water with lemon, and chatted with patrons and Mayor Bob Scannell, an independent. \u201cI always vote for the person who I think will do best for the country, and she has my vote,\u201d he said.\n\nClinton is taking a low-key approach to raising money for now, forgoing the celebrity-studded fundraisers that marked her husband\u2019s presidency, as well as the high-dollar private events put on this year by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, a potential GOP rival.\n\nInstead, Clinton\u2019s initial appeals for money will be for small-dollar donations collected over the Internet instead of in swanky fundraising blowouts in New York, Los Angeles and Silicon Valley.\n\nAdvisers have set a modest goal of raising $100 million for the primary campaign and will not initially accept donations for the general election.\n\n\u201cEveryone knows that over time Hillary Clinton will raise enough to be competitive,\u201d said Tom Nides, a top Wall Street supporter and former State Department adviser to Clinton. \u201cHer objective is not to raise money to prove that she can.

Later in the day, both presidents joined Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton at another Democratic luminary\u2019s birthday party.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said a spry-looking Clinton, donning light blue pants and a dark shirt, after Obama made his putt on the first hole at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs. The former president then kneeled down to scope out his own putt before joining Obama on a golf cart to be driven to the second hole.\n\nOccasional golf partners, Obama and Clinton had crossed paths the day before as both played separately on another golf course on the Vineyard. Rounding out their foursome on the waterside course Saturday were former Ambassador Ron Kirk and civil rights figure Vernon Jordan. Both Clintons were on the guest list for Jordan\u2019s 80th birthday party on Saturday night, along with the president, first lady Michelle Obama and daughters Sasha and Malia.\n\nFor former President Clinton, the photo-op comes as his wife, Obama\u2019s former secretary of state, struggles to demonstrate to the party that her candidacy is as infallible as was once believed. Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s poll numbers have dipped as criticism of her use of a private email server for government business mounts, leading some Democrats to give a renewed look at Vice President Joe Biden as a potential 2016 challenger to the former first lady.\n\nAs the current leader of the Democratic Party, Obama\u2019s preference in the race has been the source of intense interest, as Democrats assess which of the current or potential candidates poses the best prospect for securing his legacy and carrying it forward. Obama hasn\u2019t tipped his hand, praising both Clinton and Biden effusively. He isn\u2019t expected to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary.\n\nReporters covering Obama\u2019s vacation here were given a brief peek from a distance, with a baseball-capped Obama taking practice shots. But Saturday night\u2019s soiree took place in private, with a number of other big-name corporate, civil rights and political leaders in attendance.\n\nAn attorney and business executive, Jordan advised President Clinton and played a prominent role in the civil rights movement. He\u2019s known the Obamas for decades. Last year both Obama and Clinton attended a party Jordan hosted on the island, where Jordan and his wife summer each year.\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton, who also planned to hold campaign fundraisers while on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, arrived later in the day from Iowa, where on Saturday she insisted she never sent or received emails marked classified through her home email server. She accused her Republican opponents and GOP lawmakers of partisanship as the email affair continued to overshadow her campaign.\n\nObama and his family vacation every August on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, and he\u2019s spent most of this year\u2019s trip on the golf course, at the beach and dining at the island\u2019s upscale restaurants.

You have a stake in these folks working and paying taxes, these young people, to support your retirement. So this is good the economy as well as for society.\u201d\n\nObama spoke in Nashville at Casa Azafran, a community center and home to a number of immigrant-related nonprofits. Obama\u2019s did a question-and-answer session with immigrants and immigration activists in the Nashville area.\n\nLast month, the president announced sweeping executive actions that would shield 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\nObama said he does not believe another president will roll back the unilateral actions that he took.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that a future administration might try to reverse some of our policies. But I\u2019ll be honest with you, I think the American people basically have a good hear and want to treat people fairly,\u201d Obama said. \u201cEvery survey shows that if in fact, someone has come out, subjected themselves to a background check, registered, paid their taxes, that the American people support allowing them to stay. So, I think any administration that tried to punish people for doing the right thing would not have the support of the American people.\u201d\n\nObama explained that in the past immigration was never \u201cneat and orderly\u201d:\n\nUnless you\u2019re a member of a Native American tribe, you came here from someplace else or your people did. I know sometimes folks talk about, \u2018We came here the right way rather than wrong way.\u2019 It\u2019s true that previous generations came through Ellis Island or they came through Angel Island. There are other ways of arriving here. I think sometimes we overstate the degree to which that was some really elaborate, bureaucratic process. There\u2019s a reason, for example, these days a lot of people named Smith used to be named Smithowsky or Smitharia.\n\nHe said that often there was little paper work at Ellis Island and people slipped through under \u201canglicized\u201d names.\n\nIn response to a question about civility, Obama said it must work both ways:\n\nI\u2019ve been at the receiving end of people really angry at me about not just these executive actions, but have been ginned up by some of the conservative talk shows to think that I\u2019m usurping my authority, despite the fact that every previous president has exercised this authority, or that I\u2019m favoring immigrants over red-blooded Americans, so that\u2019s a lot of the criticism that\u2019s directed at me. What\u2019s also true is that sometimes advocates of immigrants have suggested that anybody who is concerned about the impact of immigration or asks questions about comprehensive immigration reform, that they must be racist or they must be anti-immigrant. That\u2019s not true either.\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cThe good book says don\u2019t throw stones at glass houses, or make sure we\u2019re looking at the log in our eye before we are pointing out the mote in other folks eyes.\u201d\n\nObama went on to leave out some information on the forecast for wages, if the Senate immigration bill had passed.\n\n\u201cThere are good people who believe in immigration but are concerned new immigrants will depress wages, particularly in low wage sectors of the economy,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThose are legitimate questions and we have to be just as civil in addressing those questions as we expect people to be when we are talking to them. I think the facts are on our side. I think studies have shown that over time immigrants aren\u2019t lowering wages but in fact improving the economy and over time boosting wages and jobs for everyone.\u201d\n\nThe key phrase would be \u201cover time,\u201d which he used twice. The Congressional Budget Office reported last year that under the Obama-backed Senate immigration reform bill, which provided a pathway to citizenship, an influx of newly legalized immigrants would depress wages for about a decade and lead to a short term increase in unemployment.\n\n\u201cAs noted, the additional people who would become residents under the legislation would earn lower wages, on average, than other residents, which would pull down the average wage and per capita GNP,\u201d the CBO report states, but said wages would begin to increase after 2025. Further, the same CBO report said the passage of the 2013 legislation would \u201cslightly raise the unemployment rate through 2020.\u201d\n\nThe CBO report however did say the Senate bill, if enacted, would boost the economy long term and reduce the federal deficit.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:45:18.249+0000", "event": "articles"}

And Obama has figured that you can do an awful lot to this country, and the Republicans will do what they are best at doing, which is playing catch-up and living with it.\u201d\n\nBut Steyn said that someone has to stop the out-of-control spending because we are racing towards the \u201ctotal collapse of the dollar.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe minute the dollar collapses, you won\u2019t be able to go to Walmart and live the life you used to live,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crash will be brutal and destructive, and it\u2019s why it\u2019s better to fight it now, and it\u2019s why it\u2019s better to insist that instead of Republicans being happy to go off the cliff in third gear, and offering that as an alternative, that they actually try to move people off this fatalism. Because the fatalism is un-American, Glenn.\u201d\n\nSteyn also emphasized the importance of winning the culture.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s make some feature films. Let\u2019s get a TV studio going. Let\u2019s actually get back in the game of where ideas live,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause in a Democratic society, politics reflects the culture.

Both the Times and Politico reported he would shield about 5 million people from deportation.\n\nA new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 48 percent of Americans said they disapprove of Obama taking executive action, while 38 percent said they approve. Even among Latinos, just 43 percent approve, while 37 percent oppose.\n\nOn Wednesday night, 18 House and Senate Democrats will meet with Obama at the White House to discuss the executive action, White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. No Republicans will be at the meeting.\n\nFollowing Thursday\u2019s prime-time announcement, Obama will head to Las Vegas to speak Friday at Del Sol High School about the immigration. He spoke there two years ago about how he wanted Congress to reform the immigration system.\n\nIn June, Obama asked Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson for an in-depth review about what executive action he could legally take without Congress on immigration. Some Republicans have argued such unilateral action is unconstitutional.\n\nObama himself previously cast doubt on what he could do without Congress.\n\nLast November, Obama responded to a heckler in San Francisco who was demanding he take executive action: \u201cIf I could solve all these problems without passing laws in Congress, then I would do so. But we\u2019re also a nation of laws, that\u2019s part of our tradition. And so, the easy way out is to try to yell and pretend that I can do something by violating our laws.\u201d\n\nTwo months earlier in an interview with Telemundo, Obama said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have them operate under a cloud, under a shadow. But if we start broadening that, then essentially I would be ignoring the law in a way that I think would be very difficult to defend legally. So that\u2019s not an option.\u201d\n\nAsked about that specific comment Tuesday, Josh Earnest noted that the departments of Justice and Homeland Security have since undertaken the review of what the president could do.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:45:55.900+0000", "event": "articles"}

Steve Daines, who is giving up his House seat to run for Senate. Republicans need to gain a net of six seats in the election to take control of the Senate, and Walsh faced a tough race against Daines before the plagiarism allegations.\n\nLee Newspapers of Montana first reported Walsh\u2019s departure from the race.\n\nHis decision allows the Montana Democratic Party to hold a nominating convention to choose a replacement candidate before the Aug. 20 deadline to do so. The convention will be comprised of Democratic leaders from each county\u2019s party committee, along with federal and statewide elected officials and the party\u2019s executive board. They will nominate potential candidates who will have a chance to speak before the convention before voting gets underway.\n\nThe nominee who receives a majority of votes will be selected as the replacement candidate, according to the party\u2019s rules.\n\nWalsh already had announced his candidacy for the seat when Gov. Steve Bullock appointed him in February to replace Max Baucus, who resigned from the Senate to become ambassador to China. Republicans blasted Bullock\u2019s appointment of his lieutenant governor as a political move designed to gain an advantage in the elections.\n\nThe New York Times revealed the extensive use of unattributed material in Walsh\u2019s paper about the spread of democracy in the Middle East. Walsh originally called it an \u201cunintentional mistake\u201d and told The Associated Press part of the blame may lie in his being treated for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder following his deployment in Iraq.\n\nHe later said he was not blaming PTSD for his mistake.\n\nThe pressure on Walsh\u2019s campaign grew after the revelations, with the editorial boards of Montana\u2019s three largest daily newspapers calling for him to withdraw his candidacy over the past two weeks.\n\n\u201cIf the Democrats want to hold on to the Max Baucus Senate seat, their best hope is for Walsh to step aside by Aug. 11 and for a new candidate to take his place on the ballot for a fresh start,\u201d the Great Falls Tribune wrote on July 27.\n\nWalsh is the only U.S. senator who served in the Iraq war. He capped a 33 years in the Montana National Guard, his career rising to state adjutant general before he took his first elected office in 2013 as Bullock\u2019s lieutenant governor in 2013.\n\nWalsh received the Master of Strategic Studies degree from the war college at age 47, a year before he became adjutant general overseeing the Guard and the state Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.\n\n\u2014", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:46:11.418+0000", "event": "articles"}

The special session is expected to last up to a week.\n\nThe decision to hold a special session was triggered by a ruling by a circuit court judge, Terry Lewis, who had ruled in early July that the current congressional map was illegal and ordered legislators on Friday to draw up a new map by Aug. 15.\n\nVoters in 2010 passed a so-called \u201cFair Districts\u201d amendment that says legislators cannot draw up districts to favor incumbents or a political party. A coalition of groups, including the League of Women Voters, has contended that the Republican consultants used a \u201cshadow\u201d process to draw districts that benefited Republicans.\n\nLewis agreed in July and ruled that the consultants had helped make a \u201cmockery\u201d of the process. He ruled that two of the state\u2019s 27 districts were drawn to benefit the GOP. Lewis also stated that once a new map is drawn, he will then consider whether to order a special election for the redrawn districts. Legislative lawyers have argued, however, that Lewis lacks the authority to order a special election for members of Congress.\n\nIn his emailed statement, Weatherford made it clear that while the Legislature will work up a new map in the summer session, it will fight any ruling ordering a special election. He noted that voters have already cast ballots for the Aug. 26 primary and that the NAACP has already stated that voters could be \u201cirreparably harmed\u201d if the state used a special election to elect members of Congress.\n\n\u201cWe continue to maintain our strong objection to any attempt to disrupt the current election process,\u201d Weatherford wrote.\n\nDuring a special session, legislators will have to redraw the two districts cited by Lewis: A sprawling district that stretches from Jacksonville to Orlando represented by U.S. Rep. Corrine Brown, a Democrat, and a central Florida district that is home to U.S. Rep. Dan Webster, a Republican. Any efforts to redraw these two districts would likely result in changes to other districts in central Florida.\n\nBrown, despite her party affiliation, is against the judge\u2019s order. The Democratic lawmaker said the ruling \u201cis certainly not in the best interests of Florida voters\u201d and argued only the governor, not a judge, has authority to convene a special session, according to the Florida Times-Union.\n\nShe added in an emailed statement that the existing district lines \u201cwere already approved in a bipartisan fashion in the state legislature, and were only approved after numerous statewide hearings,\u201d the Times-Union added.\n\nIt appears Brown is concerned about dismantling black-represented districts and had a letter from Congressional Black Caucus Chair U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, to bolster her contention: \u201cThere are instances where these types of lawsuits may be warranted. However, the recent Florida lawsuit aimed at dismantling the 5th Congressional district is not one,\u201d Fudge wrote, according to the Times-Union.\n\nThe decision to hold a special session so close to elections is out of the routine. Some legislators are currently in the middle of campaigning for their party primaries. Lawmakers are also barred from raising money during special sessions.\n\nDespite the ruling, legislative leaders opted not to appeal. But they asked Lewis to delay implementing on a new map until after this year\u2019s elections in order to avoid confusion at the polls. But Lewis stated Friday that right now he could not agree to that. He wrote that to do so would be telling voters \u201cthey have been deprived of the equal right of having a say in who represents their interests in Congress for two years.\u201d\n\nLewis, however, left open the possibility that further evidence could prompt him to change his mind.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:46:12.380+0000", "event": "articles"}

But if you stand by the Constitution, you\u2019re a radical that\u2019s trying to destroy America. I can get that from CNN. I can get that from MSNBC. I can get that from Barack Obama. I don\u2019t need that from the leadership of the GOP.\u201d\n\nStewart said he is \u201canything but an inside the beltway guy,\u201d and he understands the frustration.\n\n\u201cOK, so tell me what the plan is, because I don\u2019t understand this vote,\u201d Beck said.\n\n\u201cWe call it the 12 in 12 plan \u2014 12 weeks, 12 major pieces of legislation,\u201d Stewart began. \u201cWe start with Keystone, which is very important in energy independence and also job creation. But we can\u2019t go to our summit or move anywhere else beyond next week without coming back to border security, and looking at what we did with defunding amnesty.

[It] can\u2019t wait wait till February or even late January.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet me ask you this,\u201d Beck said. \u201cJohn Boehner is, you know, best buddies, tongue down each other\u2019s throat with the Jeb Bush kind of people, and Jeb Bush will not agree on the amnesty thing. \u2026 Do you really think the progressive Republicans are going to be on board for actual border security?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do. I do,\u201d Stewart responded. \u201cAnd by the way, Jeb Bush is not our nominee, thankfully.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll believe it when I see it,\u201d Beck said. \u201cI\u2019ve only got about a minute left. Give me the [complete list of] 12 topics that you say \u2026 you\u2019re going to be able to get through in 12 weeks, or you hope to get through in 12 weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeystone Pipeline, border security, REINS Act, which is to pull back the regulatory agencies who have become the most powerful force in Washington. Tax reform. I want to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the IRS, Lois Lerner and others. We\u2019ll continue to work to repeal Obamacare, and also have a replacement for that, expecting and hoping the Supreme Court actually finds the exchanges are unconstitutional. \u2026 Unborn Child Act, which is prohibits abortion for those unborn children who actually can feel pain. And we know now scientifically that they do. Audit the Fed. Some reforms in the EPA. And finally, the Antiquities Act, which deals with federal land out here in the west and the president\u2019s ability to use a law that has nothing to do with that in order to claim federal land.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you get all that done, I will throw a parade for you,\u201d Beck concluded. \u201cWe saw [the same opportunities] with the same people, the same promises, the same bull crap. \u2026 I have to tell you, between John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, I think you are in some sort of an acid trip that you think you can get this done.

Burwell is expected to determine whether residents in the 37 states that do not have state health insurance marketplaces are eligible for federal subsidies.\n\n\u201cWe are not going to go backwards. There is something deeply cynical about the attempts to roll back progress,\u201d the president said, speaking at the Catholic Health Association\u2019s annual conference in Washington, D.C. \u201dOnce you see millions of people have health care, once you see all the bad things didn\u2019t happen, let\u2019s move on. It seems so cynical to take health care away from millions of people.\u201d\n\nObama said the the Affordable Care Act is about what kind of country America wants to be.\n\n\u201cThat America is not a place where we simply ignore the poor or turn away from the sick,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s a place sustained by the idea that I am my brother\u2019s keeper and I am my sister\u2019s keeper.

The matter eventually led to litigation, notably by the Christian owners of Hobby Lobby, who charged that the mandate violated their religious freedom. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby last year.\n\nLitigation continues in other cases, including four where religious freedom plaintiffs have gotten the upper hand on the administration, according to the Beckett Fund for Religious Liberty. The Supreme Court told the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider an earlier decision siding with the government against the Michigan Catholic Conference in a case regarding the HHS mandate. Lower courts have also provided some relief from the mandate to Little Sisters of the Poor in Colorado; Wheaton College in Illinois; Notre Dame University in Indiana; and Archbishop David Zubik and the Diocese of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe White House contends that five years into the law, 16 million more Americans have health insurance.\n\n\u201cFive years in, what we\u2019re talking about is no longer just a law. This isn\u2019t about the Affordable Care Act. This isn\u2019t about Obamacare,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about myths or rumors that won\u2019t go away. This is reality. This is health care in America.\u201d\n\nAddressing other warnings, Obama repeated the words \u201cin reality\u201d to say more people now have insurance they like and that the economy has experienced job growth since the law was passed.\n\nObama said improvements still need to be made.\n\n\u201c\u201dWe have to protect the coverage and sign more people up,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe need more governors to expand Medicaid which was part of the overall plan.\u201d\n\nObama said the law has quantifiable success in newly insured people and \u201cthe number of lives saved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen there are the outcomes that are harder to calculate \u2013 yes, in the tally of pain and tragedy and bankruptcies that have been averted, but also in the security of a parent who can afford to take her kid to the doctor,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe dignity of a grandfather who can get the preventive care he needs.

{"entityId": 159, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Though most members of Congress are generally supportive of the air strikes against Islamic State terrorists in Iraq, many say President Barack Obama has a constitutional obligation to get congressional approval if the operation is prolonged. Obama, so far, has not given a timeframe.\n\nConstitutional law experts disagree on whether the president must get congressional authorization at all, under either his constitutional authority or under the War Powers Act.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s not a violation now, it will be if it continues without congressional authorization,\u201d Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, told TheBlaze. \u201cIf it happens to rise to the level of war, it will require congressional authorization. There is debate about how large a force has to be before it\u2019s a war, but ongoing air strikes over weeks and months would require congressional authorization.\u201d\n\nAs commander-in-chief, the president does not need to get congressional approval to continue the attacks because the Islamic State poses a viable threat to the United States, said Jon Yoo, a former Justice Department attorney during the Bush administration specializing in national security matters.\n\n\u201cThe practical limitation on the president\u2019s commander-in-chief power is Congress\u2019s power over the purse and its sole right to raise and support the military,\u201d Yoo, now a law professor at University of California at Berkeley, told TheBlaze. \u201cWithout Congress\u2019s support, President Obama cannot long afford the costs of extended air operations over Iraq.\u201d\n\nYoo does not anticipate such a showdown in this case.\n\n\u201cDespite the muted complaints of Democratic isolationists and Rand Paul supporters, the majority in Congress I believe want the president to be more aggressive in Iraq, not less, and funding should be readily approved,\u201d Yoo added. \u201cNo constitutional conflict will result.\u201d\n\nThe airstrikes commenced late last week in concurrence with a humanitarian effort to help Christians and Yazidis facing persecution and potential genocide in the country.\n\nThe House voted overwhelmingly in late July, 370-40, calling for Obama to get congressional approval for any sustained troop presence. But it was a non-binding resolution.\n\nMeanwhile, most of the warnings to Obama have come from prominent members of his own party. Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said earlier this week Obama should get congressional approval. \u201cThis is especially the case since the president has indicated that our renewed military engagement in Iraq could be a long-term project,\u201d Kaine said.\n\nAlso this week, House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), said, \u201cAll of us agree that boots on the ground are not in the offing, at this point in time, nor should they be \u2026 without further consultation and action by the Congress.\u201d\n\nBeyond the Constitution, there is the War Powers Act, that some conservative contend is not a constitutional law. The 1973 law, enacted over the veto of President Richard Nixon, says that the president can only send combat troops when where there are imminent hostilities for 60 days before he has to get congressional authorization to continue.\n\nOn this point, both Somin and Yoo also disagree.\n\nYoo said this is in part because Congress already authorized the use of force in Iraq.\n\n\u201cThe 2002 authorization to use military force against Iraq is still on the books, and provides the president with continuing legal support,\u201d Yoo said. \u201cThe AUMF is not just limited to removing Saddam Hussein.\u201d\n\nThe authorization states: \u201cThe president is authorized to use the armed forces of the United States as he determines to be necessary and appropriate in order to (1) defend the national security of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq; and (2) enforce all relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding Iraq.\u201d\n\nSomin contends that Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress authority over land and naval forces and controlling deployment. Therefore, the War Powers Act, he said, is perfectly constitutional and does obligate the president to involve Congress.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said last week that Obama will abide by the War Powers Act and has kept Congress engaged.\n\n\u201cConsistent with those consultations, the administration will comply with any applicable reporting requirements in the War Powers Resolution,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cSometimes these War Power notifications are classified, sometimes they aren\u2019t\u2014in this case, if one is necessary and if our lawyers determine that it is necessary, I would anticipate that is something we likely would be able to release publicly.\u201d\n\nAs a matter of policy, Somin has no problem with taking the fight to the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t myself think it\u2019s a problem to go after ISIS with air strikes from a policy standpoint. I think it\u2019s is better legally and politically if Congress authorizes it,\u201d Somin said. \u201cISIS is more of a threat to the U.S. than Moammar Gadhafi was in 2011. This is better than the case for striking Syria because in Syria both sides were arguably just as bad. Whatever the flaws in the Iraqi government, they and the Kurds are better morally and better for American interests than ISIS.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:47:15.945+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 166, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 There\u2019s a whole year of campaigning, positioning and politicking to go before the next campaign for president kicks off with the Iowa Caucus in early 2016. Ten things to look out for next year that might tell us something about how that campaign to come (which is really already underway) may shake out.\n\n1. Courtrooms Before Campaigns\n\nThree Republican governors who appear likely to run for president face legal issues at home that could derail a campaign before it gets started. Texas Gov. Rick Perry was indicted in August on two felony counts of abuse of power for publicly threatening to veto funding for public corruption prosecutors, and then making good on that threat.\n\nAn investigation into alleged illegal coordination between Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s 2012 recall campaign and conservative groups is on hold pending action from the state Supreme Court, while federal prosecutors in New Jersey continue to investigate what role Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s administration played, if any, in tying up traffic on the George Washington Bridge in 2013.\n\n2. Middle-Class Economics\n\nThe stock market is up, unemployment is down and economists are giddy about prospects for America\u2019s economy to grow in 2015. But while economic indicators are glowing, how middle class voters benefit amid the recovery will shape the presidential campaign. So far, many have not: the typical American family\u2019s income is 8 percent lower than it was before the recession hit in 2007. That helps, in part, explain President Barack Obama\u2019s stagnant approval ratings, and could be a problem for Hillary Rodham Clinton or any other Democrat expected to defend his, and therefore the party\u2019s management, of the economy.\n\n3. Iowa Straw Poll\n\nThe Iowa Republican Party\u2019s presidential straw poll has come under sharp scrutiny in the past two campaigns after elevating candidates out of step with the larger Iowa and national GOP. The event, held the summer before the winter caucuses, is also a source of tension among campaigns which pay a steep price to take part in what is nominally a fundraiser for the state party. Gov. Terry Branstad, Iowa\u2019s six-term governor, wants to end it, while the Iowa Republican Party chairman and central committee have the votes to keep it going. The committee is expected to decide at its Jan. 10 meeting the fate of the 40-year fixture on the presidential campaign calendar.\n\n4. GOP Governors and Medicaid\n\nTwo years into the Affordable Care Act, Republican governors remain divided over whether to adopt a key provision of the law that provides health insurance to poor uninsured people via Medicaid. Possible GOP White House prospects, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, accepted what\u2019s known as Medicaid expansion. Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal refused, citing concern over the cost. Others, including Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, adopted hybrid programs that expand insurance coverage with limits. How voters view Obamacare and its impacts in states with different approaches to its implementation is sure to figure in the party\u2019s presidential primary debates.\n\n5. Right to Work\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker faces the prospect of another public fight with organized labor early in 2015 should the state\u2019s GOP-controlled legislature try to pass a \u201cright to work\u201d law, which would make private labor union membership optional. Walker\u2019s successful effort to curtail the union rights of public employees led to weeks of visible and vocal protests in Madison during his first term, something he\u2019s eager to avoid as he weighs if and when to enter the race for president. But it is a priority for Republican lawmakers who expanded their majorities in the midterm elections and aren\u2019t as tied to the law\u2019s presidential political implications as their ambitious governor.\n\n6. Republican Debates\n\nAfter a prolonged 2012 primary season that left their presidential nominee bloodied, the Republican National Committee is making significant changes to its debate schedule ahead of the presidential primary season. Party leaders plan to dramatically reduce the number of debates and assert more control over the selection of moderators.\n\nStill, logistical questions remain for a 2016 primary field that could feature well more than a dozen high-profile contenders. When the debates begin, candidates may struggle to speak for more than a few minutes on a stage featuring so many podiums.\n\n7. Immigration Actions\n\nPerhaps no issue will riddle Republicans as much as immigration in the next presidential campaign. GOP hopefuls must balance an appeal to conservatives who detest anything they view as \u201camnesty\u201d for people living in the U.S. illegally, while also reaching out to the nation\u2019s fast-growing Hispanic population.\n\nRepublicans in Congress successfully pushed to fund the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the nation\u2019s immigration enforcement, only through next February, creating a moment in which they can try to challenge Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration while in control of both houses of Congress. Some GOP lawmakers are also at work drafting business-friendly bills to boost visas for farm and high-tech workers. Republicans running for president will be asked if they back their party\u2019s actions in Congress, and if not, be expected to propose their own solutions.\n\n8. Common Core\n\nIn a Republican primary where the candidates may have more similarities than differences, the party\u2019s debate over the Common Core education standards could be explosive. Once endorsed by state leaders in both parties, some conservatives have attacked the voluntary standards as a government takeover of education. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush may have more on the line than anyone, having dedicated much of his political career to education and refusing to withdraw his support for Common Core. One-time supporters, such as Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, have reversed course and become vocal critics. The issue could emerge as a deal breaker among many conservatives who hold great sway in Republican primaries.\n\n9. Clinton and the Economy\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton drew snickers this past summer when, while promoting a book for which she was handsomely paid, she said she and husband Bill Clinton were \u201cdead broke\u201d when they left the White House. She continues to give speeches that command fees of $200,000 or more, traveling to them by private jet. With an income that places her among the top 1 percent of Americans, and close ties to Wall Street dating to her time as a senator from New York, how Clinton shapes her economic message will be watched by a party with a renewed focus on income inequality and economic anxieties for middle-class families.\n\n10. WWWD: What Will Warren Do?\n\nMassachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has, for months, told anyone able to ask that she \u201cis not running for president.\u201d That has not stopped hopeful liberals in the Democratic Party from talking up a Warren campaign. Will it be enough for them if Warren were to declare that she \u201cwill not\u201d run for president? Or will their hopes for an insurgent campaign from the left linger deep into 2015, should the populist senator stick with her grammatically flexible description of her plans for 2016?\n\n____\n\nAssociated Press writers Steve Peoples and David Scott in Washington; Jill Colvin in Newark, New Jersey; Nicholas Riccardi in Denver; Michael J.

I will never understand that kind of greed.\u201d\n\nSanders\u2019 remarks came on the same day that Americans for Prosperity, a conservative activists organization backed heavily by the Kochs, heard from several Republican White House hopefuls.\n\nSanders typically does not mention Clinton or any Republican candidates by name, but relishes telling his audiences that he stands out for refusing any support from Super PACs, the political committees that can accept the unlimited sums as long as they don\u2019t coordinate directly with candidates\u2019 principal campaign committees.\n\nHe says he has more than 400,000 individual contributors who have chipped in an average of $31.20. \u201cThis is a people\u2019s campaign,\u201d he said in North Charleston.\n\nThe rally Saturday night concluded a two-day swing in South Carolina, which hosts the South\u2019s first primary, weeks after Iowa and New Hampshire start the nominating contest.\n\nSouth Carolina is the first of the early voting states to feature a large number of African-American voters. Sanders and his aides have acknowledged that he must increase his support among African-Americans, here and nationally, if he hopes to turn his surprising momentum into a serious challenge against Clinton.\n\nIn each of his South Carolina stops, Sanders attempted to link his progressive agenda to concerns and challenges prevalent in the black community.

A House selected committee continues to investigate.\n\nIn response to a question from TheBlaze, McCarthy insisted that violating the separation of powers \u2013 which the House of Representatives is suing the Obama administration over \u2013 is not the only area where Obama must be held accountable.\n\n\u201cOnce you know what impeachable offenses are, when you know what high crimes and misdemeanors are, you look at a president who doesn\u2019t defend Americans under terrorist siege for hours notwithstanding that he knew from the earliest part of the assault that a terrorist attack was underway,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then you go through other things like Fast and Furious, where you had a Justice Department that actually armed violent Mexican crime syndicates intentionally to try to make cases, separation of powers is a big problem, but it\u2019s hardly the only problem.\u201d\n\nParticipating in a forum Tuesday sponsored by the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, McCarthy \u2013 the author of a book on impeaching Obama \u2013 sat at a table with House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) \u2013 whose committee would be the first to review an impeachment inquiry of any federal official.\n\nBut neither McCarthy nor Goodlatte advocated for impeachment, even though McCarthy thinks it\u2019s legally warranted.\n\n\u201cThe only real reason to ever go down the road of impeachment would be to remove a president,\u201d McCarthy said.\n\n\u201cIf the president can\u2019t be removed from power, I think it\u2019s actually a tactical error to begin your way down that road, because what we know would happen would be if the president were impeached in the House and inevitably won his impeachment trial in the Senate, that would be spun by the White House and the media as a vindication of the way that Obama has governed for the last six years,\u201d McCarthy continued. \u201cSo far from cracking down executive lawlessness, which is the goal, you would in the end inadvertently more of it.\u201d\n\nStill, McCarthy said the power of the purse and impeachment were the only real tools Congress has against executive lawlessness. He was critical of the House lawsuit that alleges Obama\u2019s executive overreach violates separation of powers.\n\n\u201cThe interesting thing is we are talking about a president who is lawless, which is the reason you\u2019re in court in the first place,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThe premise of the lawsuit is that the president is going to honor the judgment of the case against him.\u201d\n\nGoodlatte, as the Judiciary chairman, is the point man and defended the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIt was the decision of the leadership that a lawsuit would be appropriate,\u201d Goodlatte said. \u201cI happen to think it\u2019s important to get the courts more engaged in protecting the separation of powers and engaged in the protecting the rule of law. If you have the courts on the sidelines saying \u2018these are political controversies between the Congress and the executive, we are going to stay out of it,\u2019 you don\u2019t bring to bear all the forces that can hold a president in check.\u201d\n\nHe pointed that the House sought executive branch accountability in other case, such as litigating the subpoenaed documents regarding the Operation Fast and Furious, a botched Justice Department program that allowed about 2,000 guns to flow from the U.S. to Mexican drug trafficking organizations.\n\n\u201cThe more of these you do, the more the ultimate judgment, the ultimate check, the judgment of the people can be brought to bear,\u201d Goodlatte said.\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:47:31.779+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 176, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "If you were responsible for making sure every eligible vote in your state counts, without any double votes or manipulation, how would you do it?\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, several states have attempted to tighten up voting requirements in order to safeguard their elections from fraud. The court determined it was unconstitutional to require certain states get federal approval before changing their election laws. The ruling allowed states to take matters into their own hands to institute measures that ensure the integrity of their elections.\n\nBut some states are coming under fire for those changes, while others aren\u2019t.\n\nOne such example came in February, when the Ohio legislature agreed to eliminate the \u201cgolden week\u201d at the beginning of the election period where Ohioans can both register to vote and cast an in-person absentee ballot.\n\n\u201cThere was a calculated attempt on behalf of political operatives to register and vote simultaneously when they were not eligible to do so, Ohio decided to change the law so that couldn\u2019t happen again,\u201d J. Christian Adams, a former Justice Department official and counsel at the Election Law Center, told TheBlaze.\n\nOpponents of such protective measures characterize the efforts as \u201cdiscriminatory\u201d restrictions that will \u201cdisenfranchise\u201d certain groups of voters. An excerpt from New York Times editorial board Sunday sums up this side of the argument:\n\nRepublican officials \u2026 around the country are battling down to the wire to preserve strict and discriminatory new voting laws that could disenfranchise hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans,\u201d the opinion reads. \u201cSimilar laws have been aggressively pushed in many states by Republican lawmakers who say they are preventing voter fraud, promoting electoral \u2018integrity\u2019 and increasing voter turnout. None of that is true.\n\nFederal and state court rulings in Texas, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have agreed with the NYT editorial opinion: \u201cThere is virtually no in-person voter fraud; the purpose of these laws is to suppress voting.\u201d\n\nBut Republican voting experts say that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth, citing recent high-profile examples that have raised questions about the real voting fraud numbers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ironic that folks are anxious to return the law to a situation where it\u2019s easy to commit voter fraud,\u201d Adams said. \u201cHow much voter fraud is OK? Is one unit acceptable? Five units? One hundred units? How many instances do we have to have, and whose vote should be sacrificed?\u201d\n\nReinforcing the point, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted released evidence in July \u201cthat a single vote can determine the outcome of an election.\u201d Sixteen local races and four local issues on the ballot in the 2014 primary election were decided by one vote or through a tie breaker.\n\n\u201cIn less than a year, 63 races in Ohio have been decided by one vote. This underscores the importance of election access and integrity, and why it is so important to make it easy to vote and hard to cheat,\u201d Husted said.\n\nNevertheless, federal offices \u2014 partnering with leftist advocacy groups \u2014 filed legal motions to either stay or remove some state voting laws. In the memo filed in a North Carolina suit, the Justice Department argued that \u201cunverified voters nevertheless represent a low level of possible fraud in view of the nearly half a million people who use (same day registration),\u201d and claimed, \u201cthe provisions at issue were motivated by a discriminatory purpose.\u201d\n\nBut the numbers simply don\u2019t support the Democratic argument that Republicans have an agenda to suppress black voters in order to gain an electoral advantage in states like North Carolina.\n\nIn 2008 (when Democrats won the state) and 2012 (when Republicans won), African-Americans made up 23 percent of the electorate, according to the Washington Post. But when George W. Bush won the state by 12 points in 2004, exit polls showed 26 percent of the electorate was African-American.\n\nNot all states seem to merit close scrutiny of their voting laws. Historically blue states \u2014 including ones that have stricter laws than some swing states \u2014 do not get the same level of scrutiny and legal action.\n\nNew York, Delaware, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Connecticut are among some of the historically blue states that lean Democratic in presidential elections but have no early voting or require an excuse for an absentee ballot. New Hampshire is a prime example: The state\u2019s strict new voter identification law going into effect in 2015 eliminates student IDs \u2014 and state-issued voter identification cards \u2014 as valid forms of ID. The Justice Department has yet to file a suit in that historically Democratic state.\n\nVoting experts say this disparity between how voting rights advocates chase after laws in certain states versus others is highlighted best by the \u201cnonsensical\u201d arguments coming from the Justice Department in the North Carolina case, with respect to early voting opportunities.\n\n\u201cThe way they\u2019ve structured their argument is, if you have any early voting and then you cut it back at all, you\u2019ve violated the law. But if you have no early voting, you haven\u2019t violated the law,\u201d said Robert Popper, a senior attorney with the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch. \u201cThat makes no sense, but that is their argument.\u201d\n\nPopper said this is one of the Justice Department\u2019s primary tactics for targeting red or swing states.\n\n\u201cThe way they set it up is as suspicious as a layman would think,\u201d Popper told TheBlaze. \u201cTo argue, \u2018If you have [early voting] then take it away, you violate the law, but if you never had it, then you aren\u2019t breaking the law. Frankly, that\u2019s as kooky as it sounds.\u201d\n\nAnd some voting process changes in primarily blue or swing states have gone completely uncontested by the Justice Department or by leftist advocacy groups, when it appears the decision may help a Democratic cause. Last year, Colorado\u2019s Democratic-controlled state legislature approved \u2014 and Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper signed \u2014 a bill drastically changing the voting process in the Centennial State: getting rid of all traditional polling stations and mailing each voter a ballot instead.\n\nThe law also established same-day registration, \u201cwhich allows someone to appear at a government office and register and vote on the same day without showing photo ID or any other verifiable evidence that establishes identity,\u201d National Review points out. \u201cIf they register online a few days before, no human being ever has to show up to register or vote. A few keystrokes can create a voter and a \u2018valid\u2019 ballot.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s upcoming U.S. Senate race between Democratic Sen. Mark Udall and Republican Cory Gardner is crucial, since the outcome could determine the balance of the Senate. The most recent Colorado Senate race in 2010 was determined by an 11,000-vote margin.\n\n\u201cThese worries aren\u2019t theoretical. This last election, El Paso County caught a person who registered five times using false information. County officials caught him, but only because they had 29 days before the election to investigate the registration fraud,\u201d Colorado State Attorney Scott Gellar said. \u201cUnder an election-day registration scheme, this person would have been able to vote several times.\u201d\n\nColorado\u2019s El Paso County clerk, Wayne Williams, said the new law \u201ctakes us back to the corruption of 19th-century Tammany Hall,\u201d and will degrade public confidence in the voting process and ballot integrity.\n\nHans von Spakovsky, a former Federal Election Commission official who leads the conservative Heritage Foundation\u2019s Election Law Reform Initiative, said the state-by-state scrutiny from the Justice Department and leftist advocacy groups boils down to an intimidation and fear-mongering tactic.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, they want to use this to scare their base,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know they try to make this argument, \u2018Republicans are trying to suppress your vote, therefore you need to go vote,\u2019 and it helps them to try to raise money.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd frankly, most of the recent convictions for voter fraud have all been democrats,\u201d von Spakovsky continued. \u201cAnd so you have to wonder, are they against putting in place rules that will deter and prevent voter fraud because it will make it harder for them to commit it?\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Elizabeth Kreft (@elizabethakreft) on Twitter", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:47:36.045+0000", "event": "articles"}

But they couldn\u2019t name any senior Republicans when pressed.\n\nFurther, White House press secretary Josh Earnest expressed doubt about whether House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) was sincere when he said impeachment is not on the table.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the speaker said on a number of occasions that there would not be steps taken by Republicans to shut down the government over health care,\u201d Earnest said of Boehner, adding, \u201cMaybe you need to ask him a little bit more about whether impeachment is on the table or not.\u201d\n\nSome conservatives have called for impeaching Obama regarding executive overreach on issues such as Obamacare, immigration and guns without congressional authorization. The Democratic National Committee and Organizing for America have consistently used impeachment in fundraising emails to warn donors about what could happen if Republicans win more seats in the House and gain control of the Senate.\n\nThe topic first made news Friday after Dan Pfeiffer, a counselor to the president, told a Christian Science Monitor breakfast: \u201cI would not discount that possibility. I think Speaker Boehner, by going down the path of this lawsuit, has opened the door to Republicans possibly considering impeachment at some in the future.\u201d\n\nAsked about the comment, Earnest said, \u201cThere are senior members of the Republican Party, or prominent voices in the Republican Party who are calling for exactly that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWho? Sarah Palin?\u201d CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked, referring to the 2008 GOP vice presidential candidate who called for Obama\u2019s impeachment.\n\n\u201cShe mentioned it,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nAcosta followed, \u201cIs anyone in the Republican leadership talking about that?\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of fundraising emails with the word impeachment in them.

Have you been studying the possibility of him being impeached?\u201d\n\nEarnest didn\u2019t have a specific answer, and pivoted to how the important issues are reforming the Veterans Administration and addressing the border crisis.\n\n\u201cHere we are, one week before Congress is about to leave town and there is not a discernible path that Congress is going to make progress on this,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cInstead, we see Republicans giddy about the prospect of passing legislation along a party line vote to pursue a taxpayer funded lawsuit agains the president of the United States merely for doing his job.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the briefing, Earnest was critical of Boehner for saying there would not be a vote on immigration reform. Sirius XM radio reporter Jared Rizzi asked: \u201cYou quoted the speaker about immigration. The speaker has also said he is not interested in impeaching the president. So why do you believe what the speaker says about immigration but not when it comes to impeachment?\u201d\n\nEarnest said there is reason to be skeptical of what Boehner says on topics.\n\n\u201cI do believe that the speaker said on a number of occasions that there would not be steps taken by Republicans to shut down the government over health care,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cWe did see that that happened.

The promise of equality and freedom is one that all of us have to work for, at all times. I know this as a survivor of the Japanese American internment, which each day drives me only to strive harder to help fulfill that promise for future generations.\n\nI recently was asked by a reporter about Justice Clarence Thomas\u2019s dissent in the marriage equality cases, in which he wrote words that really got under my skin, by suggesting that the government cannot take away human dignity through slavery, or though internment. In my mind that suggested that this meant he felt the government therefore shouldn\u2019t be held accountable, or should do nothing in the face of gross violations of dignity. When asked by a reporter about the opinion, I was still seething, and I referred to him as a \u201cclown in blackface\u201d to suggest that he had abdicated and abandoned his heritage. This was not intended to be racist, but rather to evoke a history of racism in the theatrical arts. While I continue to vehemently disagree with Justice Thomas, the words I chose, said in the heat of anger, were not carefully considered.\n\nI am reminded, especially on this July 4th holiday, that though we have the freedom to speak our minds, we must use that freedom judiciously. Each of us, as humans, have hot-button topics that can set-us off, and Justice Thomas had hit mine, that is clear. But my choice of words was regrettable, not because I do not believe Justice Thomas is deeply wrong, but because they were ad hominem and uncivil, and for that I am sorry.\n\nI often ask fans to keep the level of discourse on this page and in comments high, and to remember that we all love this country and for what it stands for, even if we often disagree passionately about how to achieve those goals. I did not live up to my own high standards in this instance.\n\nI hope all of you have a wonderful, safe and joyously free July 4t, the first where all married couples in the U.S. can enjoy the full liberties of matrimony equally.

{"entityId": 210, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The U.S. may not have \u201crisen from recession\u201d quite as rousingly as President Barack Obama suggested in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. Seven years after that severe downturn began, household income hasn\u2019t recovered and healthy job growth is complicated by the poor quality, and pay, of many of those jobs.\n\nIt\u2019s always problematic when a president takes credit for an improving economy, just as it is when he\u2019s blamed for things going bad. A leader can only do so much, for better or worse, and there are two sides to every economy. But after an election in which Obama largely held off on chest-beating, he claimed credit in bold terms for what is going right.\n\nAlso in his speech, Obama skimmed over the cost to taxpayers of free community college tuition and invited closer scrutiny with his claims about U.S. support for Syrian moderates and about his record of public-lands preservation.\n\nA look at some of his claims, and the facts and the political climate behind them, in his speech:\n\nOBAMA:\n\n-\u201dAt this moment \u2013 with a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry and booming energy production \u2013 we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth.\u201d\n\nObama: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the fastest economic growth in over a decade\u2026\" \u2014 TheBlazeNOW (@TheBlazeNOW) January 21, 2015\n\nTHE FACTS: By many measures, the economy is still recovering from the deep scars left by the Great Recession.\n\nJob growth has been healthy, but fueled in part by lower-paying jobs in areas such as retail and restaurants, which have replaced many higher-paying positions in manufacturing and construction. Part-time jobs also remain elevated: There are still 1.7 million fewer workers with full-time jobs than when the recession began in December 2007.\n\nAnd the faster hiring hasn\u2019t pushed up wages much. They have been growing at a tepid pace of about 2 percent a year since the recession ended 5 1/2 years ago. That\u2019s barely ahead of inflation and below the annual pace of about 3.5 percent to 4 percent that is typical of a fully healthy economy.\n\nThat has left the income of the typical household below its pre-recession level. Inflation-adjusted median household income reached $53,880 in November 2014, according to an analysis of government data by Sentier Research. That is about 4 percent higher than when it bottomed out in 2011. But it is still 4.5 percent lower than the $56,447 median income in December 2007, the month the recession began.\n\nBooming energy production is indeed a reality, but that\u2019s a phenomenon many years in the making, with the development of cost-effective extraction from fracking and other means playing into the rise of the U.S. as an energy production giant.\n\n\u2014\n\nOBAMA: \u201cI am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college \u2013 to zero.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Zero for qualifying students; an estimated $60 billion over 10 years to the treasury.\n\nObama confronts a Republican-controlled Congress that can be expected to be wary of a new program costing that much. Moreover, the proposal requires states to contribute about a quarter of the money, and getting them to go along is bound to be tough. Many states refused to expand Medicaid under the health care law, for example, even though Washington is picking up the entire cost in the first years.\n\nOn the other hand, community college is an issue close to home for state government, perhaps more appealing than partnering with Washington on the health law, so the idea could have a fighting chance if it can get through Congress. Educators are divided on its merits, with some worrying that aid for a community college education could divert students and scholarships away from four-year schools.\n\n\u2014\n\nOBAMA: \u201cWe\u2019ve set aside more public lands and waters than any administration in history.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: Waters is the key word here. Before expanding the Pacific Remote Islands National Monument last year from almost 87,000 square miles to more than 490,000 square miles, Obama had protected far fewer acres than his four predecessors, including President George W. Bush.\n\nExpansion of the massive Pacific islands monument puts Obama on top. It\u2019s nearly all water, however, and the move has limited practical implications. While it bans commercial fishing, deep-sea mining and other extraction of underwater resources, little fishing or drilling occur in the mid-ocean region now.\n\n\u2014\n\nOBAMA: \u201cThanks to a growing economy, the recovery is touching more and more lives. Wages are finally starting to rise again. We know that more small-business owners plan to raise their employees\u2019 pay than at any time since 2007.\u201d\n\nTHE FACTS: A survey of small businesses by the National Federation of Independent Business does show that a rising proportion plans to raise wages. But plans to raise pay aren\u2019t the same as actually raising them.\n\nAverage hourly earnings rose just 1.7 percent in December from 12 months earlier, according to the Labor Department. That\u2019s about half the rate that is typical of a healthy economy and actually lower than the previous month. Economists generally expect wage gains to accelerate this year, as unemployment continues to fall and businesses are forced to offer higher pay to attract workers. But there is scant evidence that it is happening yet.\n\n\u2014\n\nOBAMA: \u201cIn Iraq and Syria, American leadership? \u2013 including our military power \u2013 is stopping ISIL\u2019s advance. Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We\u2019re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort.\u201d\n\nObama calls on Congress to pass resolution to \"authorize the use of force against ISIL.\" \u2014 TheBlazeNOW (@TheBlazeNOW) January 21, 2015\n\nTHE FACTS: The U.S. also has been slow to set up long-promised training for the moderate Syrian opposition, and has yet to begin the actual vetting of the rebels. Also, despite persistent pleas from the rebels, the U.S. hasn\u2019t sent the more lethal weapons they want. U.S. officials have expressed concerns that the weapons could end up in the hands of insurgents.\n\nMilitary leaders, however, agree that coalition airstrikes and the military effort in Syria and Iraq have stopped the momentum of the Islamic State group, or ISIL, made it hard for the insurgents to communicate and travel, and hurt their oil revenues.\n\n\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Kimberly Hefling, Dina Cappiello and Lolita C.

I\u2019m running for president of the United States because I\u2019m ready to be commander-in chief on day one,\u201d Graham told the crowd. He later added. \u201dOur allies feel the weakness of American leadership. Our adversaries are taking advantage of it.\u201d\n\nGraham was an early and staunch supporter of the invasion of Iraq in 2002 and the 2007 troop surge. He has been a consistent critic of Obama administration for not being strong enough on Iraq, Afghanistan and the general war on terrorism. He even lumped Paul and Obama together in criticizing the proposed nuclear deal with Iran.\n\n\u201cThe world is exploding in terror and violence but the biggest threat of all is the nuclear ambitions of the radical Islamist who control Iran. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no moderates in Iran running their government,\u201d Graham said Monday. \u201cIf the United States isn\u2019t firm in our intention to deny them such weapons, Iran will trigger a nuclear arms race in the least stable region on earth, making it more likely that the people who aspire to genocide will have the most effective means to commit it.\u201d\n\nHe was also among the most aggressive senators in seeking the truth about the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks that killed four Americans, including U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens. After the administration swapped five Taliban detainees for the return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, Graham invoked impeachment if Obama made any more such deals without informing Congress.\n\nHowever, on domestic issues, he has caused much angst among conservatives.\n\nGraham has been a leading Republican supporter of providing a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States, seeking to pass climate change legislation and advocating tax hikes to reduce the debt. He also prompted anger from conservatives for supporting President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nominees. He is a close ally of 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, the Arizona senator who also raises the ire of the right.\n\nGraham was first elected to the Senate in 2002 in a very conservative state, filling the seat of the polarizing Sen. Strom Thurmond.\n\nGraham is the ninth announced candidate to enter the Republican nominating contest, and more are expected to join the crowded field. Though he barely registers in most polls, South Carolina is the first southern primary, and since 1980 has picked the winner of the Republican presidential nominating contest, with the exception of 2012.\n\nThat alone doesn\u2019t necessarily make him a favorite in the state, where he faced six primary opponents in the 2014 Republican Senate primary.\n\nBut he touted himself as a conservative in his announcement, and invoked Ronald Reagan\u2019s peace through strength doctrine that helped win the Cold War. Graham said only security through strength would be achievable in the war on radical Islam.\n\n\u201cWe will never enjoy peaceful co-existence with radical Islam whose followers want to destroy our way of life,\u201d Graham said. \u201cSecurity through strength will protect us.\u201d\n\nGraham was first elected to Congress in 1994, winning an open House seat, the first Republican to win that district since 1877. It was in the House where he gained national prominence in the 1998 impeachment and 1999 Senate trial of President Bill Clinton on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice as part of the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He was among the House Republican impeachment managers, playing the role of a prosecutor in unsuccessfully trying to persuade the Senate jury to remove the president from office.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:48:33.537+0000", "event": "articles"}

It also has the potential to become a political risk for Hillary Rodham Clinton as she moves toward a second presidential campaign.\n\nThe former secretary of state has struggled with some recent bad headlines over large donations given to the foundation by foreign governments in the past two years, and the $200 million-plus the organization has raised since 2013, ahead of her anticipated White House campaign.\n\nRepublicans contend that foreign governments donating to a foundation led by a potential U.S. president creates unacceptable conflicts of interests. Also, the involvement of big money reinforces a long-standing narrative pushed by the GOP of the Clintons as a couple who frequently mix business and politics.\n\n\u201cUnless Hillary Clinton immediately reinstates the ban on foreign countries giving to her foundation and returns the millions of dollars these governments have already donated, she\u2019s setting an incredibly dangerous precedent,\u201d said the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus. \u201cThe American people are not about to elect a president in Hillary Clinton who could expose them to the demands of foreign governments because they dumped massive sums of cash into her foundation.\u201d\n\nThe foundation, which is scheduled to hold events in Morocco and Greece this spring, defended its financial support and addressed how it might function if Clinton runs for president. If she seeks office again, something taken as a given by most, the foundation said it would ensure its policies and practices are \u201cappropriate, just as we did when she served as secretary of state.\u201d\n\nIn 2009, when Clinton became President Barack Obama\u2019s chief diplomat, the foundation stopped raising money from foreign governments. The fundraising involving non-U.S. entities resumed in 2013, after she left his administration.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal last week reported the foundation had received money in 2014 from the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Oman and others. The Washington Post reported the charity has raised nearly $2 billion since the former president started it in 2001. About one-third of its donations of $1 million or more come from foreign governments or non-U.S. entities, the newspaper found.\n\nDemocrats say the Clintons can defend their work at the foundation because of its track record and history of tackling some of the world\u2019s biggest problems, from AIDS and clean water to hunger, educational opportunities and the protection of endangered wildlife.\n\n\u201cThe foundation has done amazing work,\u201d said Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, a Democrat who campaigned with Bill Clinton last year. \u201cIt has been a unifying force in our national affairs and in our international affairs.\u201d\n\nThey also note that the foundation voluntarily discloses its donors \u2013 nonprofits are not required to do \u2013 and say there is no evidence the Clintons have used it to enrich themselves. Nearly 90 percent of the foundation\u2019s money goes toward its programming.\n\n\u201cIf your criticism \u2026 is that she raised too much money for her charity to help people around the globe, OK, I\u2019ll take that,\u201d said Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a longtime Clinton friend and former board member of the foundation.\n\nYet the influx of corporate and foreign money just before a potential Hillary Clinton campaign has caused some anxiety within her party.\n\n\u201cThere was a reason they stopped taking foreign government donations when Hillary was secretary of state,\u201d said Mike Carberry, a Johnson County, Iowa, supervisor and former county Democratic chairman. He said the foundation should reinstate the policies used from 2009 to 2013. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem right.\u201d\n\nThe foundation has strong ties with several corporations and other large foundations. Last September\u2019s annual meeting in New York was sponsored by an array of companies that regularly lobby the federal government, including financial firms HSBC Bank USA, Barclays and Deutsche Bank, as well as Fortune 500 companies such as Coca-Cola, Microsoft, Monsanto, Procter & Gamble and ExxonMobil.\n\nGoldman Sachs, whose corporate officers have played leading roles in the Treasury Department in recent years, has worked with the Clinton Foundation on the 10,000 Women Initiative aimed at helping female entrepreneurs around the globe access capital.\n\nMany of the same donors to the Clintons\u2019 political campaigns have given money to the foundation. Dennis Cheng, a former Hillary Clinton campaign fundraiser, recently left the foundation as its chief development officer and is expected to be a top fundraiser for her expected campaign.\n\nThe examination of the foundation\u2019s finances come as many Democrats want Clinton to take on a more populist economic agenda that would demand more oversight of Wall Street firms. It also follows efforts by Democrats to scrutinize Republican Mitt Romney\u2019s business practices in 2012 and tie Republican candidates to millions of dollars provided by the Koch Brothers and their business interests.\n\nBeyond the headlines, many Democrats say it shows the need for Clinton to begin actively campaigning and build an apparatus better suited to rapidly respond to these types of critiques.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a vacuum,\u201d said Tom Henderson, the chairman of the Polk County, Iowa, Democrats, who noted potential candidates such as former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb are visiting soon. \u201cShe isn\u2019t doing anything\u201d in Iowa, he said.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:48:56.273+0000", "event": "articles"}

He cited the attempted ban on .50-caliber ammunition and weapons, a bill restricting magazines to 10 rounds and a statewide gun owner ID program.\n\nChristie reiterated the frustration he has with the \u201canti-gun\u201d legislature he has to deal with in New Jersey.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the news for anybody who\u2019s governor or president, you\u2019re not emperor or dictator,\u201d Christie added.\n\nAt one point, the man held up his cell phone and asked the governor about a 1995 ad where Christie attacked his opponent for supporting a repeal of the assault weapons ban in New Jersey. Christie responded, \u201cIf you haven\u2019t changed your mind once in 20 years on any issue, then I tell you, you\u2019re not a thinking, breathing, living human being.\u201d\n\nThe entire back and forth between voter and candidate (who did not give his identity to reporters on the scene) reportedly took almost five minutes.

But throughout the 27-minute speech to the Washington D.C. Republican Party Straw Poll event, many in the crowd were louder than Carson in expressing their approval for the 2016 presidential candidate\u2019s thoughts about education, fiscal responsibility and national security.\n\nAbout halfway through the speech, a campaign advance man said the mic was working, and brought it to Carson. It worked for about one sentence, and Carson said, \u201cTake it back. We\u2019re doing OK.\u201d\n\nThe famed neurosurgeon did better than OK in the straw poll, easily winning by 44 percent of the vote.

You don\u2019t have to scream and shout in order to be a person of principle.\u201d\n\nCarson talked about Iran and Cuba as examples where he would be a tougher negotiator than the Obama administration.\n\n\u201cThe world is very complex,\u201d Carson said. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost an enormous amount of influence in the world because we are not people of our word and because we back down.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration has argued that it would be irresponsible for the United States to back out of the Iran nuclear deal in part because allies such as Britain, France and Germany, as well as the United Nations Security Council, have endorsed the plan.\n\nCarson contends that the United States should again be in a position to lead allies rather than be led.\n\n\u201cOnce we have the kind of leadership that gains respect throughout the world, including our allies, you will find that they will go along with us rather than oppose us,\u201d Carson said. \u201cSo you have to repair that relationship before you go around and start trying to reverse everything. \u201c\n\nNevertheless, Carson said he believes that Congress can stop the Iran nuclear deal if it has the will.\n\n\u201cOf course it\u2019s reversible,\u201d Carson said. \u201cI\u2019m very hopeful that our Congress will not agree with this. If in fact, they truly are Americans, as opposed to blind followers of the president, I think we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nAnother front where Carson said he would be a tougher negotiator was with Cuba, which opened an embassy in Washington Monday, while the United States opened an embassy in Havana.\n\n\u201cI would not have normalized relations with them at this time. I don\u2019t have any problems with normalizing the relationship, but not without getting anything back,\u201d Carson said.\n\nHe then pointed out that Cuban President Raul Castro is in his 80s. Castro is 84.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be there forever,\u201d Carson told TheBlaze. \u201cThey are going to have new leadership, and that is going to be a good time to really get into negotiations about bringing them into the Western Hemisphere culture.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:49:06.657+0000", "event": "articles"}

And I think her time in the position of secretary of state is demonstrably one that lacks accomplishment but that also has some real blemishes on it.\u201d\n\nFiorina then delivered a slew of statements about Hillary Clinton\u2019s history and some of the problems she sees with the candidate\u2019s background:\n\nIt\u2019s a problem when you mislead the American people for a month about what really happened in Benghazi. It\u2019s a problem when you believe that Vladimir Putin can be thwarted by a red reset button. I\u2019ve met Vladimir Putin, I\u2019ve sat across the table from him. There\u2019s no way a red reset button is gonna work. It\u2019s a problem when our relationship with Israel has deteriorated so badly. It\u2019s a problem when terrorism is on the rise and not on the wane, as she and the president try and convince the American people.\n\nBrzezinski waited for Fiorina to finish and fired back, questioning her own background, which includes a failed 2010 U.S. Senate run and a period of time as CEO of Hewlett-Packard that saw the company shed jobs and fire her.\n\n\u201cAre you really the right person to be criticizing Hillary Clinton\u2019s accomplishments or lack thereof?\u201d Brzezinski asked.\n\nFiorina barely got out the words, \u201cWell, you\u2019ve clearly been reading the Democratic talking points\u2026\u201d when she was interrupted by Brzezinski.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m reading Fortune, I\u2019m reading the New York Times,\u201d said Brzezinski.\n\nFiorina responded with her own resume highlights, \u201dWe accomplished a lot at Hewlett-Packard. We doubled the size of the company to almost ninety billion dollars, we quadrupled the growth rate from two percent to nine percent, we tripled the rate of innovation to eleven patents a day, we quadrupled cash flow, we went from lagging to leading.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski steered the conversation away from Fiorina to panelist and former Treasury Department official, Steve Rattner.\n\nRattner and Fiorina briefly tussled about the merger of Hewlett-Packard and Compaq Computers (which happened under Fiorina\u2019s watch) was a success or a failure. Rattner sees it as a failure while Fiorina insists \u201ceveryone now acknowledges it was a successful merger with Compaq.\u201d\n\nThings calmed down a bit near the end of the segment. Brzezinski complimented Fiorina on some of the \u201cincredible things\u201d she has done for women before asking, \u201cDo you think Hillary Clinton has opened doors for women?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course,\u201d answered Fiorina, calling Mrs. Clinton \u201can example and inspiration for many women.\u201d\n\nAfter she complimented Clinton, Fiorina circled back to her earlier points, \u201cIf we are going to have a real conversation about tapping the potential of men and women, then we also have to be able to talk beyond gender and talk about track record and accomplishments and policies.\u201d\n\nBrzezinski wrapped the segment with a simple, \u201cFair enough.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Mike Opelka (@Stuntbrain) on Twitter.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:49:07.659+0000", "event": "articles"}

Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke founded the group, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has classified as a hate group.\n\nIn a written statement, Scalise aide Moira Bagley Smith confirmed that Scalise addressed the group as it gathered at a New Orleans-area hotel near the neighborhoods that both Scalise and Duke represented during separate stints as state lawmakers.\n\nSmith said in her statement that Scalise spoke only to rally support for conservative fiscal policies in Louisiana, not to endorse the mission and views of his audience. Smith\u2019s statement came after a liberal Louisiana blogger, Lamar White Jr., first reported the 12-year-old story using online postings from members.\n\n\u201cThroughout his career in public service, Mr. Scalise has spoken to hundreds of different groups with a broad range of viewpoints,\u201d Smith wrote. \u201cIn every case, he was building support for his policies, not the other way around.

Many strategists say both parties must figure out how to reach beyond their respective bases.\n\nScalise, 49, ascended to his leadership post in June in the chain of events that followed then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor\u2019s surprise defeat in a Republican primary.\n\nScalise won the whip race with the solid backing of House conservatives, particularly Southerners who wanted a greater leadership voice considering the region\u2019s role in giving Republicans their largest House majority since President Herbert Hoover\u2019s administration at the start of the Great Depression.\n\nHe won his seat in a 2008 special election after helping build a more cohesive Republican caucus in a Louisiana statehouse that historically had not operated along party lines.

But what may be more surprising is that the liberal editorial boards of both the New York Times and the Washington Post shared the view Tuesday.\n\nAt least as far as legacy media goes, these are the three most influential editorial pages unusually speaking with one mind on the legal troubles of a political figure who can be polarizing.\n\nThe New York Times called Perry \u201cone of the least thoughtful and most damaging state leaders in America, having done great harm to immigrants, abortion clinics and people without health insurance during his 14 years in office.\u201d\n\nBut with that preface, the newspaper continued: \u201cBut bad political judgment is not necessarily a felony, and the indictment handed up against him on Friday \u2014 given the facts so far \u2014 appears to be the product of an overzealous prosecution.\u201d\n\nA Travis County Texas grand jury indicted Perry on two felony counts of abuse of power and coercion of a public official after Perry first threatened, then made good on his threat, to veto $7.5 million in state funding to the Public Integrity Unit headed by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg. Lehmberg was arrested for driving with a blood alcohol level of more than three times the legal limit and afterward became violent with the police and had to be restrained. She was sentenced to 45 days in jail. Perry said he would veto funding for the unit if Lehmberg didn\u2019t resign, which she did not. Perry said he was standing up for the rule of law and would cast the same veto again.\n\n\u201cMr. Perry should have left the matter to the courts, where both a criminal and a civil attempt to have her removed failed, or to the voters,\u201d the Times editorial said. \u201cBut his ill-advised veto still doesn\u2019t seem to rise to the level of a criminal act.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post editorial likewise criticized Perry for opposing Medicaid expansion and his handling of immigration, but also pointed out that Lehmberg\u2019s office was investigating alleged diversion of state cancer research funds to Perry\u2019s political allies.\n\n\u201cMany people would find it reasonable to pursue the ouster of such a person from such a position,\u201d the Post editorial said. \u201cWhen Ms. Lehmberg refused to go, Mr. Perry carried out his veto.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat everyone should recognize is that this particular kerfuffle fell within the bounds of partisan politics, which, as the saying goes, ain\u2019t beanbag,\u201d the Post continued. \u201cThe grand jury, however, would criminalize Mr. Perry\u2019s conduct by twisting the pertinent statutes into a pair of pretzels.\u201d\n\nPerry, in his third term, is not up for re-election in Texas, but has been sounding like a potential candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial Monday said Perry was indicted for the \u201chigh crime of exercising his constitutional right to free speech and his legal power to veto legislation.\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually when prosecutors want to use the criminal statutes to cripple a political opponent, they come up with at least some claims of personal or political venality,\u201d the Journal said. \u201cIn this case the D.A.\u2019s office is trying to criminalize the normal process of constitutional government. \u2026 Even if Mr. Perry was motivated by political animus toward the public-integrity unit, which has a history of politicized prosecutions, so what?

{"entityId": 289, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush raised $114.4 million in the first six months of the year to fuel his White House ambitions, a historic amount that takes full advantage of the nation\u2019s evolving campaign finance laws.\n\nNo candidate for president has benefited from so much money so early in a campaign, and the total is sure to eclipse the fundraising of each of the other 16 major competitors for the Republican nomination.\n\n\u201cPeople have been willing to take a look, and he\u2019s overcome the people who have said, \u2018Not another Bush,\u2019\u201d said Bill Kunkler, a Chicago construction company executive and Bush donor. \u201cPeople are looking at him as a guy who did it on his own, and who stands on his own.\u201d\n\nThe former Republican governor of Florida is taking a unique approach to a presidential bid, delegating many operations to an affiliated group that is free of limits on how much money a traditional campaign can raise from individual donors.\n\nThe affiliated group, a super PAC called Right to Rise, has been active since January. Run by a trusted Bush strategist, it said Thursday it had raised $103 million between January and the end of June.\n\nRight to Rise is not subject to the limits placed on donors to Bush\u2019s campaign, and he spent the past six months traveling the country to attend fundraisers for the super PAC. The suggested donation at Right to Rise events was often as much as $100,000.\n\nThe rest, $11.4 million, came to Bush\u2019s formal campaign in the 16 days between its kickoff and the end of June. Contributions to the formal campaign are limited to checks of no more than $2,700 for the primary and general election.\n\nThat amounts to an average of roughly $710,000 a day, which the campaign touted as more than the $562,000 per day average raised by Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton since she launched her campaign April 12. Clinton\u2019s campaign haul in that time totaled $45 million.\n\nBush\u2019s campaign must provide additional fundraising details, including the names of donors and how much they gave, to federal regulators by Wednesday night.\n\n\u201cJeb is encouraged and grateful for the tremendous early support and enthusiasm his candidacy has generated since he launched his campaign,\u201d New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, the Bush campaign national finance chairman, said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are confident our campaign will have the resources needed to get Jeb\u2019s conservative record, message and vision for the future out to voters across the country,\u201d he said.\n\nLike Bush, several other GOP candidates have said ahead of that deadline how much their campaigns have raised. Among them, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz raised $14.2 million, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson raised $10.5 million and former technology executive Carly Fiorina raised $1.4 million.\n\nThe son and brother of two presidents, Bush came to the race with a deep roster of experienced fundraisers and likely donors. With their help, he traveled the country raising money for Right to Rise after saying in December he planned to explore a campaign.\n\nThe super PAC is based in Los Angeles, where its leader, Mike Murphy, lives. It plans to handle a huge part of the costly work of running for president, including buying TV, online and radio commercials, conducting polling and even doing some organizing tasks such as voter outreach in early primary states.\n\nBy law, it can\u2019t take direction from the campaign, and the two operations have limits on how they can communicate.\n\nRight to Rise already is advertising on Bush\u2019s behalf. It has spent $47,000 so far on digital media, according to documents filed this week with the Federal Election Commission. The group has also inquired with broadcast and cable stations in the early primary states about booking TV ad time.\n\nBush\u2019s official campaign bank account, although notably smaller than the super PAC\u2019s, is important because it will pay for his travel and employee salaries and give him a pot of money from which to craft messages exactly as he sees fit.\n\n\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writer Steve Peoples contributed to this report.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:50:26.592+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 291, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Voters across the country voted on major issues that could have direct impact on their lives such as taxes on gasoline, prison sentences and the matter of keeping your doctor if you like your doctor.\n\nThough some were meaty matters, it was easy to get lost in the news of Republican capturing control of the Senate and key governors races. Further, state ballot initiatives that legalized marijuana and raised the minimum wage grabbed most headlines on referenda. But health care, abortion and gun rights were also on the ballot.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of ballot issues with potential national consequences that passed under the radar Tuesday.\n\n1. If You Like Your Doctor in this State\u2026\n\nVoters in South Dakota approved a measure to ensure patients have their choice of doctor \u2013 a pushback against a chief concern about Obamacare.\n\nUnder the ballot initiative approved Tuesday, doctors that agree to the conditions of the insurance plans, such as payments, could not be restricted from joining the insurer\u2019s network. Patients pay less for in-network providers than for those outside the network of an insurance plan. The state\u2019s medical association and hospitals favored the initiative, while insurance companies opposed it.\n\n2. Lighter Sentences\n\nCalifornia voters rolled back the prison sentences for nonviolent felony convictions. The initiative changed from a felony to a misdemeanor: petty theft, receiving stolen property and forging or writing bad checks for $950 or less. The initiative approved by voters also required decreased sentences for certain drug possession offenses.\n\n3. Voting on Taxes\n\nTennessee doesn\u2019t have an income tax, and now it\u2019s it will be extremely difficult to impose one. Voters in the state approved a state constitutional amendment Tuesday to ban the imposition of an income tax, a proposal that comes up every few years when the state legislature is looking for more revenue.\n\nGeorgia voters approved a freeze on state income taxes to prohibit the state legislature from hiking taxes and requiring a popular vote to determine if people are willing to pay more.\n\nMassachusetts moved toward shedding its image as \u201ctaxachachusetts\u201d when voters approved a measure to eliminate the automatic increase in the state\u2019s gasoline tax, which is currently tied to inflation. Instead, the state legislature would have to actively raise the tax.\n\nNot every state wanted a tax cut. Illinois voters approved a \u201cmillionaires tax,\u201d which will impose an additional 3 percent tax on those earning more than $1 million.\n\n4. Mixed Results on Abortion\n\nOf three states where abortion was left to voters, only Tennessee approved a measure that comes close to a restriction. The Tennessee ballot language stated \u201cnothing in Constitution of Tennessee secures or protects right to abortion or requires the funding of an abortion\u201d and that the state lawmakers can \u201cenact, amend or repeal statutes regarding abortion.\u201d In other words, state law now gives the Tennessee legislature permission to restrict abortion.\n\nTwo other states rejected anti-abortion measures.\n\nIn Colorado, voters rejected a measure to change the state\u2019s criminal code to define a fetus as a \u201cperson\u201d or \u201cchild.\u201d North Dakota voted down a measure to guarantee the \u201cinalienable right to life of every human being at every stage of development must be recognized and protected.\u201d\n\n5. Victory for Gun Control\n\nVoters in Washington state backed Initiative 594, backed by gun control groups funded by Michael Bloomberg. The law strengthens background checks on gun purchasers to include gun shows and online sales. It marked a rare win for gun control advocates at the ballot box. Voters there also rejected a competing measure, Initiative 591, backed by the National Rifle Association, to prohibit any state background laws stricter than federal laws.\n\nHowever, in Alabama, voters decided to codify the \u201cright to bare arms\u201d in their state constitution. The measure also confronts the potential for international limitations on gun rights. The ballot language reads, \u201cevery citizen has a fundamental right to bear arms and that any restriction on this right would be subject to strict scrutiny; and to provide that no international treaty or law shall prohibit, limit, or otherwise interfere with a citizen\u2019s fundamental right to bear arms.\u201d\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:50:28.598+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 294, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 With frustration mounting, President Barack Obama sought Thursday to quell doubts he\u2019ll use his presidential powers to act on immigration, telling Hispanics and immigration activists it\u2019s \u201cnot a question of if but when.\u201d\n\nAt the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute\u2019s annual gala, Obama warned activists that his eventual actions will spark intense political opposition that could threaten the durability of what he does. In a partisan pitch a month before Election Day, he urged Hispanics across the U.S. to use their votes to improve prospects in the future for a legislative fix.\n\nThe president was reportedly interrupted twice by an audience member, identified as \u201cundocumented activist\u201c Blanca Hernandez, during his speech. Both times she yelled, \u201cWe need relief now,\u201d as she objected to deportations under Obama.\n\n\u201cIf anybody wants to know where my heart is, or whether I want to have this fight, let me put those questions to rest right now: I am not going to give up this fight until it gets done,\u201d Obama said.\n\nHernandez was reportedly escorted out by security.\n\nOnce hailed as a champion for Hispanic rights, Obama\u2019s relationship with the Hispanic community has become strained since he decided last month to abandon his earlier pledge to act quickly after summer\u2019s end to help some immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Instead, he said he\u2019d wait until after the Nov. 4 elections, exasperating immigration activists who accused the president of putting politics ahead of their families and said they had waited far too long already.\n\nWith the elections nearing, Obama sought to parlay impatience into motivation for Hispanic voters to elect politicians who will enact more sweeping reforms to fix the U.S. immigration system. Arguing that no executive action on immigration could be as comprehensive as what Congress could do, he urged Hispanics at the black-tie dinner to go into their communities to ensure voters don\u2019t stay home.\n\n\u201cYes we can \u2013 if we vote,\u201d he said, first in Spanish and then in English, in a twist on his 2008 campaign slogan.\n\nThe White House has been coy about what unilateral actions Obama and his administration are considering, and legal experts differ about just how far Obama can go without Congress. Immigration activists are calling for Obama to act aggressively to free a sizeable portion of the 11.5 million immigrants here illegally from fear of deportation.\n\nSuch a possibility has incensed Republicans who say Obama\u2019s willingness to ignore existing laws is the key reason they\u2019re reluctant to work with him to pass new ones.\n\n\u201cThe president\u2019s promise isn\u2019t about making the best policy or enforcing the law \u2013 it\u2019s an admission that his pledge to not uphold the law in the future would be bad for his party now,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.\n\nA supportive crowd offered the president a mostly warm reception, although a group of demonstrators gathered outside the convention center in protest of Obama\u2019s delay.\n\nAnd at the podium, Obama was gently nudged by Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., who said Hispanics were looking to Obama \u201cfor big, bold, unapologetic\u201d relief without delay.\n\n\u201cWe need major reforms, we need them now,\u201d he said, \u201cand Mr. President, we need your help.\u201d\n\n(H/T: Huffington Post)", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:50:36.918+0000", "event": "articles"}

And Senate Republicans skittish over politically dangerous cuts to Medicare blocked a House move that called for giving subsidies to future retirees to purchase health insurance on the open market instead of a guaranteed package of Medicare coverage.\n\nUnder Washington\u2019s arcane budget process, lawmakers first adopt a budget that\u2019s essentially a visionary document and follow it up with binding legislation to set agency budgets, cut or raise taxes, and make changes to so-called mandatory programs like Medicare and food stamps, whose budgets run as if on autopilot.\n\nRepublicans tout the long-term economic benefits of a balanced budget and say it\u2019s better to tackle the long-term financial problems of programs like Medicare and Medicaid sooner rather than later.\n\nBudget Committee Chairman Tom Price, R-Ga., said the GOP plan \u201cwill not only get Washington\u2019s fiscal house in order but pave the way for stronger economic growth, more jobs and more opportunity. It invests in our nation\u2019s priorities, ensures a strong national defense and saves and strengthens and protects important programs like Medicare and Social Security.\u201d\n\nBut Democrats say the GOP plan unfairly targets the middle class and the poor while leaving in place lucrative tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy.\n\n\u201cThe Republican budget moves this country in exactly the wrong direction,\u201d said Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who Thursday announced a run for the Democratic presidential nomination. \u201cAt a time of massive wealth and income inequality, it gives huge tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, while making devastating cuts to education, Medicare, affordable housing and prescription drug coverage.\u201d\n\nThis year, Republicans are focused mostly on finally delivering legislation to President Barack Obama that would repeal the bulk of his signature health care law. Successful action on Thursday\u2019s budget plan would permit a health care repeal to advance through the Senate without threat of a Democratic filibuster. Obama is sure to veto the measure, which is scheduled to advance by late July.\n\nWhile assuming expiration of health insurance subsidies and repeal of the expansion of Medicaid coverage under the health care law, the measure relies on about $2 trillion worth of cuts to health care providers and tax hikes enacted under the 2010 law to promise balance over the coming decade.\n\n\u201cThe Affordable Care Act is still here, the revenue is still here, and the Republican budget assumes that revenue for the purpose of achieving balance,\u201d said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md. \u201cThat leaves people\u2019s heads spinning and it means the budget is not in balance.\u201d\n\nSeparately, the House moved ahead on spending bills for the departments of Veterans Affairs and Energy. Both measures face veto threats because they fall short of Obama\u2019s budget request, even as Republicans are skirting next year\u2019s budget limits on the Pentagon by $38 billion by padding off-budget war accounts.\n\nObama insists he\u2019ll block Republicans from boosting the Defense Department\u2019s budget unless they agree to relief for domestic programs as well. The Pentagon and domestic agencies alike are being hit by automatic spending cuts known as sequestration, which are the result of Washington\u2019s collective failure to come up with enough deficit savings to replace them.\n\nThe GOP budget also promises cuts to domestic agency operating budgets that are passed by Congress each year that are deeper than the already-unrealistic levels required under sequestration. Such budgets would be cut by about $500 billion over 10 years.\n\nTwo of the Senate\u2019s Republican presidential hopefuls, Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the Senate\u2019s budget last month as too timid, while Florida\u2019s Republican Sen. Marco Rubio endorsed it.\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:50:56.732+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 321, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 Abandoning his pledge to act by the end of summer, President Barack Obama has decided to delay any executive action on immigration until after the November congressional elections, White House officials said.\n\nThe move is certain to infuriate immigration advocates while offering relief to some vulnerable Democrats in tough Senate re-election contests.\n\nTwo White House officials said Obama concluded that circumventing Congress through executive actions on immigration during the campaign would politicize the issue and hurt future efforts to pass a broad overhaul.\n\nObama had said earlier this week he would be \u201cmaking an announcement soon\u201d regarding the issue.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the president\u2019s decision before it was announced, said Obama made his decision Friday as he returned to Washington from a NATO summit in Wales.\n\nWH official confirms Obama to delay immigration action before midterms, says Obama will take action before end of year \u2014 Zeke Miller (@ZekeJMiller) September 6, 2014\n\nThey said Obama called a few allies from Air Force One and informed them of his decision, and that the president made more calls from the White House on Saturday.\n\nThe officials said Obama had no specific timeline to act, but that he still would take his executive steps before the end of the year.\n\nIn a Rose Garden speech on June 30, Obama said he had directed Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder to give him recommendations for executive action by the end of summer. Obama also pledged to \u201cadopt those recommendations without further delay.\u201d\n\nObama faced competing pressures from immigration advocacy groups that wanted prompt action and from Democrats worried that acting now would energize Republican opposition against vulnerable Senate Democrats. Among those considered most at risk were Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina.\n\nObama advisers were not convinced that any presidential action would affect the elections. But the officials said the discussions around the timing grew more pronounced within the past few weeks.\n\nUltimately, the advisers drew a lesson from 1994 when Democratic losses were blamed on votes for gun control legislation, undermining any interest in passing future gun measures.\n\nWhite House officials said aides realized that if Obama\u2019s immigration action was deemed responsible for Democratic losses this year, it could hurt any attempt to pass a broad overhaul later on.\n\nPartisan fighting erupted recently over how to address the increased flow of unaccompanied minors from Central America at the U.S. border with Mexico. The officials said the White House had not envisioned such a battle when Obama made his pledge June 30.\n\nObama asked for $3.7 billion to address the border crisis. The Republican-controlled House, however, passed a measure that only gave Obama a fraction of what he sought and made it easier to deport the young migrants arriving at the border, a provision opposed by Democrats and immigration advocates. In the end, Congress adjourned without a final bill.\n\nThe number of minors caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States has been declining since June. That decrease and Congress\u2019 absence from Washington during August has taken attention away from the border for now.\n\nStill, the dispute over how to deal with the surge of Central American border crossers threatened to spill over into the larger debate over immigration and the fate of 11 million immigrants in the United States who either entered illegally or overstayed their visas and have been in the U.S. for some time.\n\nThe Democratic-led Senate last year passed a broad overhaul of immigration that boosted border security, increased visas for legal immigrants and a provided a path to citizenship for immigrants illegally in the country.\n\nBut the Republican-controlled House balked at acting on any broad measure and House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, informed Obama earlier this year that the House would not act in 2014. That led Obama to declare he would act on his own.\n\n\u201cMy intention is, in the absence of \u2026 action by Congress, I\u2019m going to do what I can\u2026\u201d Share:\n\nDuring a news conference Friday in Wales, Obama reiterated his determination to act on his own even as he avoided making a commitment on timing. He also spelled out ambitious objectives for his executive actions.\n\nObama said that without legislation from Congress, he would take steps to increase border security, upgrade the processing of border crossers and encourage legal immigration. He also said he would offer immigrants who have been illegally in the United States for some time a way to become legal residents, pay taxes, pay a fine and learn English.\n\n\u201cI want to be very clear: My intention is, in the absence of \u2026 action by Congress, I\u2019m going to do what I can do within the legal constraints of my office, because it\u2019s the right thing to do for the country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe extent of Obama\u2019s authority is a matter of debate among legal experts and in Congress. Some Democrats say it would be best for Obama to let Congress act.\n\nBut pro-immigrant groups called on Obama to stick to his end-of-summer deadline, and weighed in with a strongly worded appeal to him on Friday.\n\n\u201cBeing a leader requires making difficult and courageous decisions,\u201d said the letter, whose signers included the National Council of La Raza and the League of United Latin American Citizens. \u201cIt is your time to lead, Mr. President.\u201d\n\nThis story has been updated.\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:51:15.543+0000", "event": "articles"}

However, a spokesman for the Limbaugh program said the program\u2019s own investigation found it was founded by Angelo Carusone, executive vice president of Media Matters for America.\n\nRush Limbaugh Show spokesperson Brian Glicklich said the investigation of the group has been going on since it began in 2012.\n\n\u201cSince they started, this small group of people has bullied and harassed small businesses through their petitions,\u201d Glicklich told TheBlaze. \u201cAt some point, you just have to put the facts out there.\u201d\n\nGlicklich said he doesn\u2019t know if there is any coordination between the group and the DCCC.\n\nCarusone, of Media Matters, contends the effort is a grassroots effort.\n\n\u201cRush Limbaugh\u2019s show has reportedly lost millions of dollars in revenue for radio companies, thousands of advertisers big and small refuse to run ads on the program and radio stations are dropping the show,\u201d Carusone told TheBlaze in a statement.\n\nCarusone further challenged the numbers.\n\n\u201cAfter initially insisting there were no troubles with advertisers, two years later Limbaugh\u2019s crisis team comes out with a report attributing this massive exodus to just 10 people?\u201d Carusone added. \u201cThe numbers just don\u2019t add up.

Rush Limbaugh is bad for business \u2014 and the only thing Limbaugh has to blame for that is his own repeated conduct.\u201d\n\nThe activists have been able to make their reach look larger by using automated tweeting software, which is in violation of Twitter rules, according to a release by Limbaugh\u2019s camp. The automated tweeting software allows them to send tweets faster.\n\nThe Limbaugh show is releasing the names of those top 10 tweeters, who account for 70 percent of all tweets.\n\nOne of the top tweeters is a professor at Kent State University. Another is a contributor to the liberal blog Daily Kos.\n\nThe DCCC appeal, sent to donors already inclined to disagree with Limbaugh, included an e-mail from former Georgetown University law student Sandra Fluke, whom Limbaugh used a derogatory term against in 2012.\n\nIn the email Fluke said, \u201cAs a previous target of Limbaugh\u2019s sexist attacks, take it from me: we need to stand together and call Rush out. The DCCC has a petition to tell advertisers to stop funding this repulsive commentary.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC said \u201cSign your name and demand that companies pull their advertising from Rush\u2019s program.\u201d\n\nThe DCCC reportedly surpassed their goal of 300,000 names.\n\nThe DCCC quoted Limbaugh saying, \u201cHow many of you guys, in your own experience with women, have learned that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018yes\u2019 if you know how to spot it?\u201d\n\nGlicklich said the DCCC is echoing the Stop Rush with a series of emails over the past several weeks.\n\n\u201cWhat the DCCC is doing is flat out reprehensible,\u201d Glicklich said. \u201cThey are interfering with private businesses, lying about what Rush said and using violence against women to get the vote out and raise money.

But with Republicans set to take full control of Congress next year, Obama is losing his last bulwark against a barrage of bills he doesn\u2019t like: the Senate.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t used the veto pen very often since I\u2019ve been in office,\u201d Obama said in an NPR interview airing Monday. \u201cNow, I suspect, there are going to be some times where I\u2019ve got to pull that pen out.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI\u2019m going to defend gains that we\u2019ve made in health care. I\u2019m going to defend gains that we\u2019ve made on environment and clean air and clean water.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s notice to the GOP came as he sought to set the tone for a year in which Congress and the president are on a near-certain collision course. Buoyed by decisive gains in last month\u2019s midterm elections, Republicans are itching to use their newfound Senate majority to derail Obama\u2019s plans on immigration, climate change and health care, to name a few.\n\nTo overturn Obama\u2019s veto, Republicans would need the votes of two-thirds of the House and Senate. Their majorities in both chambers are not that large, so they would still need to persuade some Democrats to defy the president.\n\nBut Obama said he was hopeful that at least on some issues, that won\u2019t be necessary, because there\u2019s overlap between his interests and those of congressional Republicans. On that point, at least, he\u2019s in agreement with incoming Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\n\u201cBipartisan jobs bills will see the light of day and will make it to the President\u2019s desk, and he\u2019ll have to make decisions about ideology versus creating jobs for the middle class,\u201d McConnell said in response to Obama\u2019s comments. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot we can get done together if the president puts his famous pen to use signing bills rather than vetoing legislation his liberal allies don\u2019t like.\u201d\n\nPotential areas for cooperation include tax reform and global trade deals \u2013 both issues where Obama and Republicans see at least partially eye to eye. Conversely, the likeliest points of friction surround Environmental Protection Agency regulations, the Keystone XL pipeline and Obama\u2019s unilateral steps on immigration, which let millions of people in the U.S. illegally avoid deportation and get work permits.\n\nIn the interview, recorded before Obama left Washington earlier this month for his annual Hawaii vacation, Obama also offered his most specific diagnosis to date of why Democrats fared so poorly in the midterms. He said he was \u201cobviously frustrated\u201d with the results.\n\n\u201cI think we had a great record for members of Congress to run on and I don\u2019t think we \u2013 myself and the Democratic Party \u2013 made as good of a case as we should have,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd you know, as a consequence, we had really low voter turnout, and the results were bad.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:51:45.087+0000", "event": "articles"}

Rick Perry on Sunday defended the veto that led a grand jury to indict him on two felony counts of abuse of power, noting that even some Democrats have questioned the move by prosecutors.\n\n\u201cI stood up for the rule of law in the state of Texas, and if I had to do it again I would make exactly the same decision,\u201d Perry, a potential candidate for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, said.\n\nAlready the longest-serving governor in state history, Perry has made it clear that he plans to complete his third and final term in January as planned. In an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d the governor noted that David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama, had called the indictment \u201csketchy\u201d while Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz had questioned the move.\n\n\u201cAcross the board you\u2019re seeing people weigh in and reflecting that this is way outside of the norm. This is not the way that we settle differences, political differences in this country,\u201d Perry said. \u201cYou don\u2019t do it with indictments. We settle our political differences at the ballot box.\u201d\n\nA Travis County grand jury on Friday indicted Perry for carrying out a threat to veto state funds to the local district attorney, an elected Democrat, unless she resigned following her arrest and conviction for drunken driving. That 2013 veto prompted a criminal investigation.\n\nPerry said he had lost confidence in the prosecutor and had been clear about his intentions to veto the funding. The governor said Sunday that the indictment reflected a larger problem of government agencies not following the rule of law, pointing to the Internal Revenue Service scandal in Washington and concerns about National Security Agency surveillance.\n\nSeveral Republicans have come to Perry\u2019s defense and the governor has received words of support from Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\u201cThis is the criminalization of just the legislative function and when you do that you weaken democracy. This is certainly a political attack, and this is very bad precedent,\u201d said Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, who appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d\n\nPerry is the first Texas governor since 1917 to be indicted. The charges came as he has sought to reintroduce himself to Republican leaders and rank-and-file party members eager to win back the White House. Several stumbles during his presidential bid in 2012 led to his early departure from the race.\n\nPerry\u2019s veto cut $7.5 million in funding to the state\u2019s ethics watchdog housed in the county district attorney\u2019s office. A state judge assigned a special prosecutor to investigate the veto following a complaint filed by a left-leaning watchdog group, which accused Perry of trying to leverage his power to force the resignation of District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg.\n\nThat unit of public corruption investigators is based in Austin, a liberal haven in the mostly conservative state. Voters in the county reliably elect a Democrat to serve as district attorney.\n\nPerry said Saturday he was confident that he would prevail and said those responsible for this \u201cfarce of a prosecution\u201d would be held accountable.\n\nMany Democrats criticized Perry\u2019s aggressive reaction to the indictment and accused him of trying to shift the blame.\n\nYet state Sen.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is raising money for an anti-abortion organization that plans to push his plan to end abortion without the need of overturning a Supreme Court decision or a constitutional amendment.\n\nInstead, Paul is arguing for using the words of the Constitution and the very language from the Roe v. Wade decision.\n\n\u201cNow the time to grovel before the Supreme Court is over,\u201d Paul said in the four-page letter sent out by the National Pro-Life Alliance. \u201cWorking from what the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade, pro-life lawmakers can pass a \u2018Life at Conception Act\u2019 and end abortion using the Constitution instead of amending it.\u201d\n\nThe 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling states: \u201cTexas urges that, apart from the Fourteenth Amendment, life begins at conception and is present throughout pregnancy, and that, therefore, the State has a compelling interest in protecting that life from and after conception. We need not resolve the difficult question of when life begins. When those trained in the respective disciplines of medicine, philosophy, and theology are unable to arrive at any consensus, the judiciary, at this point in the development of man\u2019s knowledge, is not in a position to speculate as to the answer.\u201d\n\nIt continues, \u201cIf this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant\u2019s case, of course, collapses, for the fetus\u2019 right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument. On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument 52 that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d\n\nPersonhood laws have been debated in state legislatures across the country. If passed, Paul\u2019s bill would define the unborn as persons protected by the 14th Amendment at the federal level.\n\nPaul argues that the Roe ruling itself opens the door for legislative action if law recognizes the unborn as people, thus protected by the Constitution, because even the ruling did not create the right to an abortion.\n\n\u201cWhen the Supreme Court handed down its now-infamous Roe v. Wade decision, it did so based on a new, previously undefined \u2018right to privacy\u2019 which it \u2018discovered\u2019 in so-called \u2018emanations\u2019 of \u2018penumbrae\u2019 of the Constitution,\u201d Paul wrote. \u201cOf course, as constitutional law, it was a disaster. But never once did the Supreme Court declare abortion itself to be a constitutional right.\u201d\n\nThough he has always taken a pro-life stance on abortion, Paul\u2019s strong libertarianism could potentially prompt social conservatives to be cautious about supporting him. However, with both the legislation \u2013 first proposed in 2013 \u2013 and now the fundraising letter, Paul is putting himself in a leadership role on the issue.\n\nIt\u2019s also a sign he is shoring up traditional Republican voters, even has he has stood out for trying to broaden the GOP base among young voters, minorities and other traditionally Democratic constituencies.\n\nThe National Pro-Life Alliance plans to do TV, radio and newspaper ads; lobby key members of Congress; run a series of newspaper columns and \u201can extensive direct mail and telephone campaign,\u201d Paul said in the letter.\n\nThe letter includes petitions to sign to go to House and Senate leaders and the resident\u2019s two U.S. senators and their House member. The organization is trying to get 1 million petitions sent to Congress.\n\nFor its part, Planned Parenthood, the nation\u2019s leading abortion provider and advocate, has used the proposal to attack Republican candidates in the 2014 midterm elections, such as Rep.

The two pieces of legislation are the first controversial bills of this session of Congress.\n\nFor Obama, who has only vetoed two bills since taking office in 2009, this is a shift and a potential signal to the GOP about how he will work with the new majority over the last two years of his presidency. White House spokesman Josh Earnest has already said Obama will continue to take executive actions in the \u201cfourth quarter\u201d of his presidency.\n\nThe Office of Budget and Management released two statements of administration policy saying only that the president\u2019s senior advisers believe he should veto a bill to build the Keystone XL pipeline, but definitively said Obama would veto another bill to eliminate the Obamacare 30-hour work week requirement, replacing it with a 40-hour week.\n\nVersions of both bills passed the House with bipartisan support last year. Earnest has previously indicated the president would veto the bills, but Wednesday marked the first formal statement of administration policy during the 114th Congress.\n\nThe bills are two of the first three bills the Republican Congress is taking up this session. The House passed the non-controversial \u201cHire our Heroes\u201d bill Tuesday with overwhelming bipartisan support to employ more veterans.\n\nRepublicans backing the legislation on the 30-hour workweek bill say the Obamacare language gives companies an incentive to cut worker hours to less than 30 hours per week.\n\nThe OMB said the workweek bill would \u201csignificantly increase the deficit, reduce the number of Americans with employer-based health insurance coverage, and create incentives for employers to shift their employees to part-time work \u2013 causing the problem it intends to solve.\u201d\n\nIt said the bill would \u201cweaken a provision of the Affordable Care Act\u201d and that \u201cthere is no evidence that this has caused a broad shift to part-time work to date.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf the president were presented with H.R. 30, he would veto it,\u201d the statement continued.\n\nAs for the Keystone bill, which has the support of a filibuster-proof 60 senators and 60 percent of the public, the OMB took a somewhat softer tone, saying, \u201cif presented to the president, his senior advisors would recommend that he veto this bill.\u201d\n\nStill, the statement said the administration strongly opposes Keystone, and should allow the traditional State Department review of cross border infrastructure projects to be completed.\n\n\u201cH.R. 3 seeks to circumvent longstanding and proven processes for determining whether cross-border pipelines serve the national interest by authorizing the Keystone XL pipeline project prior to the completion of the Presidential Permitting process,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIn doing so, it would cut short consideration of important issues relevant to the national interest. The bill also would authorize the project despite uncertainty due to ongoing litigation in Nebraska.\u201d\n\nSupporters of the Keystone pipeline project contend it will create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, while opponents argue extending it from Canada through several U.S. Western states would raise environmental concerns.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:52:58.718+0000", "event": "articles"}

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), a hero to progressives and the choice of some activists for president in 2016, has already tangled with President Barack Obama over the $1.1 trillion spending bill passed this month. Going into 2015, she appears likely to lead the charge for the left on another battle with the White House.\n\nObama is working to secure the Trans Pacific Partnership, a free trade deal with 11 other countries: Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.\n\nTrade is an area where Obama has said he hopes to be able to work with Republicans on and recently told his Export Council the deal would \u201ccreate a higher standard for trade in the fastest-growing, most populous and dynamic region in the world, the Asia Pacific region.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the odds of us being able to get a strong agreement are significantly higher than 50-50, whereas last year I think it was still sort of up for grabs,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBut Warren and two other freshmen senators want answers from U.S. Trade Representative Michael Forman, expressing fear that such an agreement \u201ccould make it harder for Congress and regulatory agencies to prevent future financial crises.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe investor-state settlement process permits for foreign companies to bypass American courts and challenge U.S. government policies before a panel of private attorneys that sits outside any domestic legal system,\u201d said a letter from Warren, her Massachusetts colleague Sen. Edward Markey and Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, all Democrats.\n\n\u201cIf the foreign company prevails, the panel can order compensation from American taxpayers without any review from American courts. The investor-state settlement process thus gives foreign companies a greater right to challenge U.S. government policies than their American allies,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe senators warned that \u201cmarket access rules\u201d in the agreement could limit the ability of the U.S. to regulate risky financial products: \u201cTo protect consumers and to address sources of systemic financial risk, Congress must maintain the flexibility to impose restrictions on harmful financial products and on the conduct or structure of financial firms.\u201d\n\nThe administration disagrees with the assessment of the TPP and has touted the trade agreement as an avenue to increase the export of products made in America, while also including strong labor and environmental standards among member countries.\n\nThe Obama administration would not do anything to undermine the financial reforms made through the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, said Jeff Zients, director of the president\u2019s National Economic Council, who seemed to reject outright the concerns of the three Democratic senators.\n\n\u201cAs for TPP, there is nothing in the proposed agreement that would have inhibited our decisive response to the recent financial crisis or that would dilute the important financial reforms we have implemented over the past four years,\u201d Zients wrote in a White House blog post. \u201cThere is also nothing that would prevent us from taking similar steps in the future. The president will not allow this agreement to undermine essential financial reforms.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, this agreement will raise standards and level the playing field for American companies to compete abroad, including for services suppliers, the largest sector of our economy,\u201d Zients continued.\n\nZients did not specify any individuals by name, but wrote two days after the senators\u2019 letter was sent that \u201cquestions have arisen over how we will protect the progress toward a safer financial system.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe United States wouldn\u2019t negotiate away its right to regulate in the public interest \u2013 with regard to public health and safety, the financial sector, the environment, or any other area,\u201d he wrote, casting the deal as a \u201conce-in-a-generation opportunity for America to set the rules for global trade in the 21st century.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:53:21.437+0000", "event": "articles"}

Young people are taught to hate. It doesn\u2019t come naturally to them.\u201d\n\nMuch of the three-day conference focused on how the United States has not kept pace with the social media messaging of terror groups like the Islamic State that have used Facebook and Twitter to recruit young people.\n\nThe president treaded carefully not to fault any single group for hateful rhetoric, and said discrimination feeds into terrorist recruitment narratives.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also seen, most recently in Europe, a rise in inexcusable acts of anti-Semitism, or in some cases, anti-Muslim sentiment or anti-immigrant sentiment,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWhen people spew hatred towards others because of their faith or because they\u2019re immigrants, it feeds into terrorist narratives. If entire communities feel they can never become a full part of the society in which they reside, it feeds a cycle of fear and resentment and a sense of injustice upon which extremists prey.

So we need to build and bolster bridges of communication and trust.\u201d\n\nObama said that all governments have a role to play to curb the propaganda and announced that the government of the United Arab Emirates is joining the United States in the effort to connect youth.\n\n\u201cAt minimum as a basic first step, countries have a responsibility to cut off funding that fuels hatred and corrupts young minds and endangers us all. We need to do more to help lift up voices of tolerance. and peace, especially online,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the United States is joining, for example, with the UAE to create a new digital communications hub to work with religious and civil society and community leaders to counter terrorist propaganda.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:53:25.365+0000", "event": "articles"}

So, we take this race very seriously, but we realize people who were ahead in the polls right now are very rarely the nominees, at least in recent times. We are playing the long game. We are putting in the effort in Iowa to do well there just as we are in the other early states.\u201d\n\nWalker dominated Iowa polls for much of 2015, but has not led since July.

Jeb Bush over the Iran nuclear deal. Asked whether he would rip up the deal on his first day in office, Bush answered, \u201cI would certainly look at it.\u201d\n\nWalker said he would get rid of the deal on day one and that no candidate should have to ponder the matter by January 2017.\n\n\u201cIf you think it\u2019s a bad deal, as I do, I think it\u2019s a horrible deal, then you should be prepared to do something about it,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThis is a bad deal.

You character. have you been ethical? Then what is your vision? That\u2019s the three keys,\u201d Chafee said told a small gathering at George Mason University in Arlington, Virginia. \u201cElections are about choices, and that\u2019s the way it should be, I\u2019m happy to join the choices out there.\u201d\n\nChafee\u2019s unusual political background includes being a Republican senator who refused to vote for George W.

This was an administration not to be trusted,\u201d he said.\n\nChafee is the son of a longtime Republican politician John Chafee, who was also a governor and U.S. senator for the small state. The senior Chafee also served as secretary of the Navy under President Richard Nixon.\n\nIn 2011, Chafee renamed the Christmas tree in the Rhode Island statehouse a \u201choliday tree,\u201d fearing that a Christmas tree would be considered offensive.\n\nLincoln Chafee was also a Republican city councilman and mayor in Warwick, Rhode Island and a state legislator. He was appointed to his father\u2019s Senate seat in 1999 upon John Chafee\u2019s death, then won it in his own right in 2000.\n\nA liberal-leaning Republican, Chafee voted against the invasion of Iraq and against the Bush tax cuts. In 2004, he wrote in George H.W. Bush\u2019s name for president instead of voting for President George W. Bush.\n\nSheldon Whitehouse ousted the younger Chafee in the 2006 Democratic wave. Chafee endorsed Barack Obama for president in 2008. In 2010, Chafee ran as an independent for governor. As an independent governor, Chafee spoke at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.\n\nChafee switched from an independent to a Democrat in 2013. According to NPR, Chafee\u2019s now-opponent in the presidential race, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, actually encouraged Chafee to switch parties.\n\n\u2014", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:53:33.022+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 435, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Ben Carson, the famed neurosurgeon who announced his 2016 exploratory committee this week to run for president, doesn\u2019t talk often about race. But his supporters argue it could be a big advantage for him.\n\n\u201cThere is no question he can win a general election,\u201d Vernon Robinson, campaign director of the National Draft Ben Carson for President Committee, told TheBlaze. \u201cThe question is can he win the primary.\u201d\n\nA mass email advertisement from the draft committee said: \u201cDid you know that Ben Carson, who is loved and revered in the black community, will automatically win the White House if he receives just 17 percent of the Black Vote! That\u2019s right, if Ben Carson receives just 17 percent of the black vote he wins every swing state.\u201d\n\nRobinson told TheBlaze that the 17 percent number is derived because the Democrats are accustomed to winning 90 percent or more of the black vote in a presidential race. Losing a significant portion could be devastating to Democrats in the Electoral College. Robinson argues that because of his background, Carson would have more credibility for campaigning in the black community than perhaps previous black GOP candidates, citing how the doctor went from poverty to being a pediatric neurosurgeon at Johns Hopkins University Hospital and running the Carson Scholars Fund, a national nonprofit to help youth escape poverty.\n\nCarson could manage to make at least a small difference in the black vote if his long shot candidacy is successful in winning the GOP nomination or if even if he is on the ticket as vice president, said Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t see a wholesale change if he is on the ticket, but it could help Republicans get their foot in the door in making their case to the black community about why Republicans are a better choice,\u201d Hagle told TheBlaze. \u201cOf course, Herman Cain was called all sorts of names by the left, a traitor to his race and so on. Carson will likely be called that too by some people who don\u2019t like Republicans and think Republicans are bad for their race. There is peer pressure.\u201d\n\nWith Carson all but declared, Robinson said that the draft committee \u2013 a superPAC \u2013 is in the process of changing its name. He thinks Carson stacks up well against likely Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton\n\nEven the Rev. Al Sharpton, a liberal activist and commentator, suggested that Clinton would have trouble inspiring black voters in 2016, expressing concern about the potential candidacy of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.). Last year, Carson\u2019s book \u201cOne Nation\u201d reportedly outsold Clinton\u2019s book \u201cHard Choices.\u201d\n\nHowever, in recent statewide races, black Republicans never even come close to a majority of the black vote, based on exit polling.\n\nFor instance, in 2014 South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott became the first ever black senator elected in the state\u2019s history, but carried just 10 percent of the black vote despite winning the election by a comfortable margin with 88 percent of the white vote.\n\nInterestingly enough, in 2006, three statewide black GOP candidates that lost their elections outperformed Scott in the black vote. Michael Steele won 25 percent of the black vote in the Maryland Senate race. Ken Blackwell won 20 percent of the black vote in the Ohio governor\u2019s race and Lynn Swann won 13 percent of the black vote in the Pennsylvania governor\u2019s race.\n\nRobinson faulted the Republican National Committee\u2019s outreach as doing little more than sending a representative to NAACP events or other large gatherings, as opposed to reaching out to black neighborhoods.\n\nIn the 2014 election, the draft Carson committee did a trial effort in African American outreach in the North Carolina Senate race, spending $321,000 on radio ads for three weeks in five media markets that primarily reached a black audience calling out Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan\u2019s position on abortion, school choice and other matters.\n\nRepublican Thom Tillis beat Hagan, but carried just over 3 percent of the black vote statewide. However, in the five markets the committee made an investment, Tillis carried about 12 percent of the black vote, Robinson said. Moreover, Sen. Elizabeth Dole, a Republican, carried just 1 percent of the black vote in 2008 in loosing to Hagan, so there was an improvement, Robinson said.\n\n\u201cWe moved the black electorate in North Carolina,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt would have been nice if we didn\u2019t have to do it all by our selves, if the party or conservative groups would have helped.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Carson explained in 2013 he doesn\u2019t talk about race because he operates on brains, which he said defines a person, not their skin color.\n\n\u201cYou see, when I take someone to the operating room and I peel down the scalp and take off the bone flap and open the dura, I\u2019m operating on the thing that makes the person who they are. It\u2019s not the covering that makes them who they are,\u201d Carson said.\n\nBeyond the vote of any single demographic, Carson faces obvious hurdles as a first time political candidate running for the nation\u2019s highest office. The announcement of his exploratory committee was overshadowed this week by a controversial statement he made on CNN about whether homosexuality is a choice, explaining, \u201cBecause a lot of people who go into prison, go into prison straight \u2014 and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d The next day, he followed with an apology.\n\nThe gaffe itself is not likely crippling to Carson\u2019s campaign, said Hagle, of the University of Iowa. But, it does demonstrate that he\u2019s not a seasoned political professional.\n\n\u201cHe hasn\u2019t run for office. That doesn\u2019t exclude him,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cThe gaffe is a bigger point because it shows he hasn\u2019t run for office and may not be fully aware what he\u2019s getting into.\u201d\n\nThe last time someone who never held high public office received a major party nomination was Wendell Willkie, a utility executive and 1940 Republican candidate who lost to President Franklin Roosevelt. Dwight Eisenhower never ran for office but was a hero of World War II with extensive leadership experience in the military and academia and won the 1952 presidential election.\n\n\u201cRoss Perot ran for president on his own platform and party, and didn\u2019t win but got quite a few votes,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cRepublicans like business experiences. The problem with Carson is he is a very smart guy but hasn\u2019t run anything.\u201d\n\nThat said, Hagle said there is a path for winning the nomination, although an unlikely one.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot of candidates in Iowa. It does not take as much to win here. So a candidate with 15 percent to 20 percent of the vote could still win if there are a lot of candidates,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cCaucuses are all about motivated voters coming out on the same day in the cold winter. A smaller group of activists that is intense can carry the day.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:54:13.274+0000", "event": "articles"}

Do you approve, yes or no?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn some ways I approve and some things I don\u2019t approve,\u201d Shaheen replied, sparking laughter from the audience.\n\nShe went on to argue that many times there aren\u2019t \u201csimple answers\u201d for policy makers.\n\nWatch the video below:\n\nShaheen\u2019s opponent is former Massachusetts Republican senator Scott Brown, who has criticized the Democrat for voting with Obama.\n\nObama\u2019s has a low approval rating nationwide, but likely voters in New Hampshire also give the president bad marks, which is probably why Shaheen wasn\u2019t ready to answer \u201cyes\u201d to the debate moderator\u2019s question.\n\nAs Shaheen did in a previous debate, she cast Brown as an outsider who doesn\u2019t understand New Hampshire. He repeatedly called her a rubber stamp for President Barack Obama\u2019s administration, reminding voters she has voted with Obama 99 percent of the time.\n\nShaheen emphasized other numbers, however, including hundreds of workers at a federal prison she helped open in northern New Hampshire, 1,200 people her office has helped avoid foreclosure and 129,000 veterans who can get health care closer to home thanks to a provision she and Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte sponsored.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a senator who\u2019s going to work for New Hampshire, who\u2019s going to make sure we address the concerns we hear from our constituents, who\u2019s going to be willing to work with Democrats, Republicans, independents \u2013 anybody in Washington who can help us get the job done for this state,\u201d she said.\n\nBrown responded, \u201cShe just described me,\u201d saying he was once the most bipartisan member of the Senate.\n\nWhen Shaheen later criticized him for not backing a comprehensive border security and immigration reform bill she and Ayotte supported, he said he opposed it because it would have given incentives to people who have been in the country illegally.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like to be an independent senator: You can disagree with your party,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to rubber-stamp a bill that doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBrown has been arguing that the rise of the Islamic State group in the Middle East points to the need for greater border security in the U.S., a position Shaheen called \u201cgrandstanding.\u201d And she said his attempt to tie concerns about the spread of the Ebola virus to border security were \u201cfear mongering.\u201d\n\nAsked about the Obama administration\u2019s decision to tighten the nation\u2019s defenses against Ebola by requiring that all arrivals from the disease-ravaged zone in West Africa pass through one of five U.S. airports, Shaheen said she\u2019s open to the idea of a travel ban only if it becomes clear that it would improve the situation. Brown said that a ban is overdue and that the administration has acted too slowly.\n\nGiven a chance to question each other, Shaheen asked Brown, \u201cWhy in the world would you support outsourcing American jobs?\u201d She said he voted to provide tax credits for companies that ship jobs overseas when New Hampshire was losing a high number of jobs to China.\n\nBrown, who denied voting to outsource jobs, said voters should consider other meanings of the word.\n\n\u201cYou said you\u2019d be an independent senator, but you outsourced that independence when you voted with the president over 99 percent of the time,\u201d he said.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:54:23.699+0000", "event": "articles"}

He answered that his Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \u201chas acknowledged that I think they underestimated what had been taking place in Syria.\u201d\n\nEarnest said the president wasn\u2019t blaming U.S. intelligence and several times said, \u201cthe president has complete confidence in the intelligence community.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverybody was surprised to see the rapid advance that ISIL was able to make from Syria across to the Iraqi border and how they were able to take over such large swaths of territory in Iraq did come as a surprise,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThat\u2019s something the president said several times and it\u2019s something senior members of the intelligence community have acknowledged as well.

It has also benefited from a sanctuary across the porous border in Syria, control of lucrative facilities there, such as oil wells, and regular movement of weapons and fighters between Syria and Iraq,\u201d McGurk told the House panel.\n\nKarl asked added that two months after McGurk\u2019s testimony to Congress, Obama called the Islamic State a \u201cJV team.\u201d\n\nKarl added that Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, chief of the Defense Intelligence Agency, made a similar warning before Congress in February.\n\nThe reporter pressed: \u201cDid the president hear this? Did he know? You mentioned Clapper. We know he heard what Clapper said, the head of the DNI. Do we know what these other top officials in his own administration were saying about the threat from ISIL?\u201d\n\nEarnest said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to get into what sort of private conversations the president had with the intelligence community.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:54:24.258+0000", "event": "articles"}

In some states, the issue of taxpayer dollars spent guarding presidential stump speeches has been prickly.\n\nWisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s political action committee announced it would cover travel expenses for Walker, including the state police that accompany him. Other governors simply say state police are required by law to guard them wherever they travel.\n\nOne Democratic contender, who left the statehouse this year, didn\u2019t have any real presidential travel under his belt while in office. Another large state is considering a change in the law to force future White House seekers to reimburse the state treasury.\n\nNo incumbent governor or recent ex-governor has formally declared their candidacy for 2016, but several have made their intentions clear (that\u2019s not including former Republican Govs. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas and Jeb Bush of Florida, both of whom left office in 2007 and would have no overlapping campaign activity for the 2016 cycle.)\n\nTheBlaze asked several governors and recent ex-governors who have signaled their intentions to run for president whether their respective states are covering the cost of their political travel, with expenses such as lodging and flights, and whether they\u2019ll reimburse their states for mandatory security costs.\n\nScott Walker\n\n\u201cTaxpayers are not paying any part of the governor\u2019s Our American Revival travel,\u201d said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Walker\u2019s PAC. \u201cAdditionally, Our American Revival is paying for all hotels, flights, rental cars and any other travel expenses for the troopers when they are on political trips.\u201d\n\nWisconsin taxpayers will still cover the salary costs for the state troopers accompanying Walker out of state, but Walker\u2019s PAC will reimburse the state for the troopers\u2019 travel, Strong said.\n\nBobby Jindal\n\nLouisiana Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal caused a bit of a stir recently after reports that the state spent $2.2 million on travel expenses related to his protective detail in the last fiscal year, up from $1.6 million in 2008 when Jindal took office, the Associated Press reported.\n\n\u201cThe state does not pay for the governor\u2019s unofficial travel,\u201d Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Louisiana governor\u2019s office, told TheBlaze in a written response.\n\nOn the question of reimbursing police, Reed said it\u2019s up to security to decide when and where to go in guarding the governor.\n\n\u201cThe state police has a legal duty to provide protection,\u201d Reed said. \u201cAs far as how, when, and where they do that \u2013 that\u2019s up to them. The governor trusts them to do their job \u2013 and he is grateful for their service.\u201d\n\nLincoln Chafee\n\nLincoln Chafee, the former Rhode Island governor running for the Democratic presidential nomination, did not visit early primary states while serving in the office from 2011 to 2015, at least not for campaign purposes, his spokeswoman said.\n\n\u201cGovernor Chafee did not visit Iowa while in office. He attended one New England governor\u2019s meeting in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire,\u201d Chafee spokesman Debbie Rich told TheBlaze.\n\nThe conference was a meeting of New England governors and premiers from eastern Canada in July 2014. Rich said Chafee did not engage in campaign activity while in office.\n\nMartin O\u2019Malley\n\nThe only other former Democratic governor expected to enter the presidential race, Martin O\u2019Malley of Maryland, has faced some scrutiny for spending $137,000 in the past fiscal year on out-of-state travel, according to NBC News 4 in Washington. All of that was used for his security detail as O\u2019Malley made at least 23 trips outside of Maryland in fiscal year 2014, including to Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nO\u2019Malley\u2019s fundraising group, O\u2019PAC, did not respond to multiple phone and email inquiries from TheBlaze.\n\nChris Christie\n\nBeyond planning his own likely presidential campaign, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was also the chairman of the Republican Governors Association in a year with several high-profile competitive gubernatorial contests.\n\nThe state of New Jersey spent $492,420 in the last year and $1.15 million over Christie\u2019s time in office for the Executive Protection Unit to guard the governor while he traveled throughout the country, according to a Watchdog.org analysis.\n\n\u201cThese are the same standards and practices that every other former governor has followed when it comes to their security detail,\u201d Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts told TheBlaze.\n\nRoberts referenced comments from Christie in 2012 when the governor was asked about the cost to taxpayers for out-of-state travel. Christie said then that he doesn\u2019t have a choice in whether the state police travel with him.\n\n\u201cNo more than when I go on vacation should I have to pay for them personally, should a campaign or political party have to pay for my protection, which is not determined by me or by the campaign but is determined by the policies of the state police based upon the threat matrix they\u2019re looking at, at the time regarding my personal safety and what they believe is the professional law enforcement approach to it,\u201d Christie said in 2012.\n\nRick Perry\n\nTexas lawmakers are considering a change in the law to force state officeholders to reimburse the state treasury for political travel.\n\nThis comes after the Texas Tribune reported the state spent an average of $1 million a year on former Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s out-of-state travel since he began a failed presidential campaign in 2011, until his final year in office in 2014. Perry is weighing another run for the White House in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to have conservative government, but you\u2019ve got a security detail, and travel expenses for that security detail [are] picked up by the state, and it\u2019s strictly political activity, there\u2019s no value for the state,\u201d state Rep. Lyle Larson, a San Antonio Republican who sponsored the bill, told the Tribune. \u201cThen they should reimburse regardless of what party affiliation.\u201d\n\nPerry received the same type of protection as previous administrations. Travis Considine, spokesman for RickPAC, said he thinks it\u2019s \u201cunfortunate\u201d that personal security for a governor would be an issue.\n\n\u201cTaxpayers did not pay for Governor Perry\u2019s political travel,\u201d Considine told TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cFor 14 years, Rick Perry was governor of Texas no matter where he went,\u201d Considine said. \u201cThe Department of Public Safety has a policy of providing security for governors and their families everywhere they travel, as they have done for several administrations. It\u2019s unfortunate that we live in a world where security is an issue, but the governor appreciated the men and women who protected him and his family during his service to our state.\n\nJohn Kasich\n\nAnother governor strongly hinting at running is John Kasich of the pivotal swing state of Ohio. Kasich\u2019s office did not respond to repeated phone calls and emails from TheBlaze.\n\nIn April, Kasich\u2019s supporters established the group New Day for America to raise money and cover the governor\u2019s travel to New Hampshire, Iowa and other states.\n\nEarlier this year, the Associated Press reported that the state covered the $3,462 cost for Kasich to travel to Washington for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s speech to Congress, but there have otherwise been few political dustups over Kasich\u2019s out-of-state trips.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:54:30.278+0000", "event": "articles"}

It also appeared on liberal outlets, and in many cases, was dismissed by them as a distraction or a non-story.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday night\u2019s edition of MSNBC\u2019s \u201cHardball,\u201d host Chris Matthews took on the topic with a balance uncharacteristic for the unabashedly left leaning network.\n\nOpening his show with a panel featuring the Washington Post\u2019s Carol Leonnig, Matt Schlapp of the American Conservative Union and Emily\u2019s List spokeswoman Jess McIntosh, Matthews spent more than 12 minutes on what he referred to as \u201cfront page news.\u201d\n\nMatthews wondered aloud about the validity of the controversy, \u201cIs this a major one, a minor one or one concocted by her critics?\u201d\n\nAfter quoting stories about the email controversy from the New York Times, the Washington Post and the Associated Press, Matthews asked McIntosh, \u201cWhere do you put this: No offense, small offense or a concoction?\u201d\n\nMcIntosh responded, \u201cEvery secretary of state prior to Hillary Clinton used a private account for their emails.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201d I think more importantly, can you possibly imagine any American family, at any kitchen table across the country, sitting down and saying, \u2018Wow, I am concerned that she used private accounts instead of state accounts. And where was the server located?\u2019 No! Because there are major economic questions that Americans are facing.\u201d\n\nMatthews interrupted McIntosh saying, \u201cNow you\u2019re changing the subject right now.\u201d\n\nThe conversation moved to whether McIntosh thought it was appropriate for Mrs. Clinton to set up her own private email server and be able to control all of her emails during the time she was secretary. Matthews wanted to know if it was OK that Clinton was the only one to decide \u201cwhen and if and what she was going to release to anybody asking for it.\u201d\n\nAgain, the Emily\u2019s List spokeswoman defended Clinton without answering Matthews\u2019 question, \u201cLots of public officials have set up their own servers, Jeb Bush did the same thing.\u201d\n\nMatthews continued to press her again, \u201cSo you think it\u2019s right for her to keep it all private, if she wants to?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said McIntosh, \u201cI mean, I think she should be able to disclose things that ought to be disclosed and keep things private that ought to be kept private.\u201d\n\nOnce again trying to get a specific answer about the issue of Clinton controlling her emails, Matthews asked, \u201cShould she be allowed to decide what she discloses?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think she should follow the letter and spirit of the law,\u201d said McIntosh.\n\nA frustrated Matthews kept pushing, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s their language that they use.

They include one request AP made five years ago and others pending since the summer of 2013.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, comes a day after Clinton broke her silence about her use of a private email account while secretary of state. The FOIA requests and lawsuit seek materials related to her public and private calendars, correspondence involving longtime aides likely to play key roles in her expected campaign for president, and Clinton-related emails about the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices.\n\n\u201cAfter careful deliberation and exhausting our other options, The Associated Press is taking the necessary legal steps to gain access to these important documents, which will shed light on actions by the State Department and former Secretary Clinton, a presumptive 2016 presidential candidate, during some of the most significant issues of our time,\u201d said Karen Kaiser, AP\u2019s general counsel.\n\n\u201cThe press is a proxy for the people, and AP will continue its pursuit of vital information that\u2019s in the public interest through this action and future open records requests,\u201d she said.\n\nState Department spokesman Alec Gerlach declined to comment. He had previously cited the department\u2019s heavy annual load of FOIA requests \u2013 19,000 last year \u2013 in saying that the department \u201cdoes its best to meet its FOIA responsibilities.\u201d He said the department takes requests \u201cfirst in, first out,\u201d but noted that timing depends on \u201cthe complexity of the request.\u201d\n\nMichael Oreskes, a senior managing editor at AP, said the news agency was planning to file additional requests under FOIA following the disclosure last week that Clinton used a private email account run on a server on her property outside New York while working at the State Department.\n\nClinton on Tuesday said she sent and received about 60,000 emails from her personal email address in her four years as President Barack Obama\u2019s secretary of state. She said roughly half were work-related, which she turned over to the State Department, while deleting tens of thousands more that were personal in nature.\n\nThe department says it will take several months to review the material Clinton turned over last year. Once the review is complete, the department said, the emails will be posted online.\n\nThe AP had sought Clinton-related correspondence before her use of a personal email account was publicly known, although Wednesday\u2019s court filing alleges that the State Department is responsible for including emails from that account in any public records request.\n\n\u201cState\u2019s failure to ensure that Secretary Clinton\u2019s governmental emails were retained and preserved by the agency, and its failure timely to seek out and search those emails in response to AP\u2019s requests, indicate at the very least that State has not engaged in the diligent, good-faith search that FOIA requires,\u201d says AP\u2019s legal filing.\n\nSpecifically, AP is seeking copies of Clinton\u2019s full schedules and calendars from her four years as secretary of state; documents related to her department\u2019s decision to grant a special position to longtime aide Huma Abedin; related correspondence from longtime advisers Philippe Reines and Cheryl Mills, who, like Abedin, are likely to play central roles in a Clinton presidential campaign; documents related to Clinton\u2019s and the agency\u2019s roles in the Osama bin Laden raid and National Security Agency surveillance practices; and documents related to her role overseeing a major Defense Department contractor.\n\nThe AP made most of its requests in the summer of 2013, although one was filed in March 2010. AP is also seeking attorney\u2019s fees related to the lawsuit.\n\nOther organizations have also sued the State Department recently after lengthy delays responding to public record requests.\n\nIn December, the conservative political advocacy group Citizens United filed suit sued the State Department for failing to disclose flight records showing who accompanied Clinton on overseas trips. Last week, the National Security Archive, an organization that gathers declassified government records, filed a lawsuit after waiting more than seven years for the State Department to release of details of former secretary of state Henry Kissinger\u2019s telephone conversations.\n\nThomas Blanton, director of the National Security Archive, predicted the State Department would speed up its review facing legal action, particularly given that Clinton has said that her email correspondence doesn\u2019t include classified material.\n\n\u201cWhen the government is under a court deadline, or really wants to review, they can whip through thousands of pages in a matter of weeks, which they should do here,\u201d Blanton said.\n\nThe State Department generally takes about 450 days to turn over records it considers to be part of complex requests under the Freedom of Information Act. That is seven times longer than the Justice Department and CIA, and 30 times longer than the Treasury Department.\n\nAn inspector general\u2019s report in 2012 criticized the State Department\u2019s practices as \u201cinefficient and ineffective,\u201d citing a heavy workload, small staff and interagency problems.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:55:04.787+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 467, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "MADISON, Wis. (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge to Wisconsin\u2019s voter identification law, allowing the law to stand and handing a victory to Gov. Scott Walker following a long fight by opponents who say it\u2019s a thinly veiled attempt to make it more difficult for Democratic backers to vote.\n\nThe law won\u2019t be enforced for an April 7 election because it\u2019s only two weeks away, but it will be in subsequent elections, the state attorney general said.\n\nWalker, a likely 2016 Republican presidential candidate, is a longtime proponent of voter ID requirements and signed Wisconsin\u2019s into law in 2011. But it was only in effect for one low-turnout primary in 2012 before legal challenges kept it on hold.\n\nThe Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to take up the case ends the legal fight, for now.\n\n\u201cThis is great news for Wisconsin voters,\u201d Walker said in a statement. \u201cAs we\u2019ve said, this is a common sense reform that protects the integrity of our voting process, making it easy to vote and hard to cheat.\u201d\n\nDemocratic critics, as well as a federal judge in Milwaukee who last year declared the law to be unconstitutional, say in-person voting fraud is extremely rare. In his ruling striking down the law, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman said there appears to have been one documented case of voter fraud in Wisconsin between 2004 and 2012, and that was committed by a man who obtained a ballot in the name of his deceased wife.\n\nOpponents of the law say its true intent is to make it more difficult for older, poor and minority voters who tend to support Democrats and are more likely not to have the proper ID.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union and allied groups persuaded Adelman to declare the law unconstitutional last year. But the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago later ruled that the law did not violate the Constitution.\n\nThe Supreme Court got involved last fall, temporarily blocking the state from requiring photo IDs in November\u2019s general election, in which Walker won another term. While the court did not comment Monday on why it declined to take the case, its decision is further evidence that it put the law on hold only because the election was close at hand and absentee ballots already had been mailed with no notification of the need to present photo IDs.\n\nFor much the same reasons, photo IDs will not be required for an election just two weeks away in which a state Supreme Court justice will be elected, said Republican Attorney General Brad Schimel.\n\n\u201cAbsentee ballots are already in the hands of voters, therefore, the law cannot be implemented for the April 7 election,\u201d Schimel said in a statement. \u201cThe Voter ID law will be in place for future elections \u2013 this decision is final.\u201d\n\nThe next statewide general election where the voter ID law will be in place is the February 2016 spring primary, although it\u2019s anticipated there may be local special elections before then where IDs will be required, said Kevin Kennedy, the state\u2019s chief elections officer.\n\nDale Ho, director of the ACLU\u2019s Voting Rights project, said he was pleased the law won\u2019t be in effect for the April 7 election and next steps were being evaluated to block the law permanently.\n\n\u201cThe last thing we need is laws that erect barriers for people who have been good voters for decades,\u201d said Andrea Kaminski, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin.\n\nWisconsin was one of four states in which a dispute over voting rules reached the Supreme Court last fall. The other states were North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.

Both believe that Jesus will return not as the Savior or Son of God but as a lieutenant to the Mahdi, and that he will force non-Muslims to convert or die.

Republicans are eager to avoid another Capitol Hill mess as they struggle to hang onto control of Congress and try to take back the White House next year.\n\nAlready they are deep into the blame game with Democrats over who would be responsible if a shutdown does happen. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has denounced Democrats\u2019 \u201cdangerously misguided strategy\u201d while House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California accuses Boehner and his Republicans of pursuing \u201cmanufactured crises.\u201d\n\nThe funding deadline does not even arrive until Sept. 30, but lawmakers face more immediate tests. Near the top of the list is renewing highway funding before the government loses authority July 31 to send much-needed transportation money to the states right in the middle of summer driving season.\n\nThe highway bill probably also will be the way lawmakers try to renew the disputed federal Export-Import Bank, which makes and underwrites loans to help foreign companies buy U.S. products. The bank\u2019s charter expired June 30 due to congressional inaction, a defeat for business and a victory for conservative activists who turned killing the obscure agency into an anti-government cause celebre.\n\nDepending on the progress of the Obama administration\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran, lawmakers could also facedebate on that issue. Leading Republicans have made clear that they are prepared to reject any deal the administration comes up with.\n\nSen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said Sunday, \u201cWell, we\u2019ve gone from dismantling their program to managing proliferation. I mean, that\u2019s our biggest concern, that\u2019s already done.\u201d\n\nAsked on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation\u201d what assurances he had received on this issue in discussions with Secretary of State John Kerry, Corker, a Tennessee Republican, replied, \u201cWell, obviously they\u2019re very anxious. I mean, I think they look at this as a legacy issue.\u201d\n\nCorker said he has told Kerry, \u2018Look, you create just as much as a legacy walking away from a bad deal as you do head-long rushing into breaking into a bad deal.\u2019 \u201c\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said Iran \u201cshould have faced a simple choice: they dismantle their nuclear program entirely, or they face economic devastation and military destruction of their nuclear facilities.\u201d\n\nBeyond the issue of Iran, the Senate opens its legislative session with consideration of a major bipartisan education overhaul bill that rewrites the much-maligned No Child Left Behind law by shifting responsibility from the federal government to the states for public school standards.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seven years overdue\u201d for a rewrite, said Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn, the bill\u2019s chief sponsor.\n\nThe House also is moving forward with its own, Republican-written education overhaul bill, revived after leadership had to pull it earlier this year when conservatives revolted.\n\nEven if both bills pass, though, it\u2019s uncertain whether Congress will be able to agree on a combined version to send to President Barack Obama. Indeed the prospects for any major legislative accomplishments arriving on Obama\u2019s desk in the remainder of the year look slim, though there\u2019s talk of the Senate following the House and moving forward on cybersecurity legislation.\n\nThat means that even though Obama was so buoyed when Congress sent him a major trade bill last month that he declared \u201cThis is so much fun, we should do it again,\u201d he may not get his wish.\n\nBut all issues are likely to be overshadowed by the government funding fight and suspense over how \u2014 or if \u2014 a shutdown can be avoided.\n\nDemocrats are pledging to oppose the annual spending bills to fund government agencies unless Republicans sit down with them to negotiate higher spending levels for domestic agencies. Republicans, who want more spending for the military but not domestic agencies, have so far refused.

Being involved in commenting is fun, but I want to get involved in the political track.\u201d\n\nWhile he\u2019s been critical of President Obama, Pearson would like to interview him.

So the agenda for all three days is going to show a wide array of combatting radicalization, violent extremism and terrorism in its many forms.\u201d\n\nWhen questions came up several times during a conference call with reporters, a senior administration official said the discussion will include other violent organization such as FARC, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. The official didn\u2019t name additional violent groups.\n\nAnother official said the Obama administration recognized that many groups call themselves Muslims, but stated: \u201cWe are not treating these people as part of a religion, we are treating them as terrorists.\u201d\n\nThe first day of the conference will focus on domestic response at the national level to violent extremist groups. The second day will focus on local community response, and include state and local law enforcement. The third day will focus on how nations can work together to combat extremist groups, and include foreign ministers and representatives from the United Nations and the European Union gathered at the State Department.\n\nPresident Barack Obama will deliver remarks at the summit Wednesday focused on domestic and international efforts to prevent radicalizing, recruiting or inspiring individuals or groups in the United States and abroad. Obama will also speak Thursday at the State Department on the summit\u2019s final day.\n\nThis summit is designed to make all stakeholders aware of the problems they face and what role they can play.

They were responding to questions by The Associated Press, which reviewed corporate documents.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to provide private details of the former president\u2019s finances on the record, said the entity was a \u201cpass-through\u201d company designed to channel payments to the former president.\n\nUnder federal ethics disclosure rules, declared candidates do not have to report assets worth less than $1,000. But the company\u2019s existence demonstrates the complexity of tracking the Clintons\u2019 finances as Hillary Clinton ramps up her presidential bid.\n\nWhile Bill Clinton\u2019s lucrative speeches have provided the bulk of the couple\u2019s income, earning as much as $50 million during his wife\u2019s four-year term as secretary of state in the Obama administration, the former president has also sought to branch out into other business activities in recent years. Little is known about the exact nature and financial worth of Bill Clinton\u2019s non-speech business interests.\n\nThe identities of several U.S and foreign-based companies and foundations that Bill Clinton worked for have been disclosed in Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent financial report as well as in earlier reports during her stint as secretary of state.\n\nUnder federal disclosure rules for spouses\u2019 earned income, Hillary Clinton was only obligated to identify the source of her spouse\u2019s income and confirm that he received more than $1,000. As a result, the precise amounts of Bill Clinton\u2019s earned income from consulting have not been disclosed, and it\u2019s not known how much was routed through WJC, LLC.\n\nWJC, LLC was set up in Delaware in 2008 and again in 2013 and in New York in 2009, according to documents obtained by The AP. The company did not appear among holdings in the Clintons\u2019 financial disclosure released last week or in previous Hillary Clinton disclosure reports between 2008 and 2013, when she resigned as secretary of state. Bill Clinton signed a document as its \u201cauthorizing person\u201d in a corporate filing in Delaware in 2013.\n\nA limited liability company is a commonly used business structure that provides tax advantages and limited legal protection for the assets of company owners and partners.\n\nThe purpose of Bill Clinton\u2019s U.S.-based company was not disclosed in any of the corporate filings in Delaware and New York, but State Department files recently reviewed by the AP show that WJC, LLC surfaced in emails from Bill Clinton\u2019s aides to the department\u2019s ethics officials.\n\nIn February 2009, Clinton\u2019s counselor, Douglas Band, asked State Department ethics officials to clear Bill Clinton\u2019s consulting work for three companies owned by influential Democratic party donors. Memos sent by Band proposed that Bill Clinton would provide \u201cconsulting services regarding geopolitical, economic and social trends affecting the entity and philanthropic opportunities\u201d through the WJC, LLC entity.\n\nState Department officials approved Bill Clinton\u2019s consulting work for longtime friend Steve Bing\u2019s Shangri-La Industries and another with Wasserman Investments, GP, a firm run by entertainment executive and Democratic party donor Casey Wasserman. The ethics officials turned down Bill Clinton\u2019s proposed work with a firm run by entertainment magnate and Democratic donor Haim Saban because of Saban\u2019s active role in Mideast political affairs.\n\nWJC, LLC was also cited by Band in a June 2011 memo sent to State Department ethics officials asking for clearance to allow Bill Clinton to advise Band\u2019s international consulting company, Teneo Strategy LLC. Band\u2019s request said Teneo would use \u201cconsulting services provided by President Clinton through WJC, LLC.\u201d State Department officials approved the three-year contract between the two companies.\n\nNone of the proposals detailed how much Bill Clinton would be paid.\n\nWhile Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2011 federal disclosure report did not mention WJC, LLC, it reported that Bill Clinton received \u201cnon-employee compensation over $1,000 from Teneo,\u201d but did not disclose a more precise amount. Federal disclosure rules require the spouses of filers to disclose the identity of any income sources over $1,000, but they do not have to provide exact figures.\n\nPass-through, or shell, companies became an issue in the 2012 presidential campaign when Republican candidate Mitt Romney disclosed a private equity entity worth $1.9 million despite failing to report the company on his previous federal disclosure.

The Hill noted Braley was gaffe-prone and ran a mostly negative campaign against Republican state Sen.

But, being a woman who had won statewide in the past, some in the GOP hoped to run a competitive race in a strategically important state. The Hill said she disappeared from the campaign trail and refused to debate Rep. Gary Peters (D-Mich.). She lost to Peters by 14 points in a state that re-elected a Republican governor.\n\n\u2022 Kentucky Democratic Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes\n\nDemocrats were practically salivating over the chance to beat McConnell this year, and money poured into Grimes\u2019 campaign. She even led McConnell at several points during the race and had the Clintons and other big-name Democrats stumped for her.

McConnell won by 15 points, and is headed toward almost certainly becoming the Senate majority leader.\n\n\u2022 New York Democratic House candidate Sean Eldridge\n\nEldridge brought personal wealth and business experience to the campaign against Rep. Chris Gibson (R-N.Y.). He spent $2.8 million of his own money into the campaign, the Hill reported, but wound up losing by 30 points.

There have been numerous examples of problematic Republican leadership, but we were hopeful our leaders got the voters\u2019 message. However, after our Speaker forced through the CRomnibus by passing it with Democratic votes and without time to read it, it seemed clear that we needed new leadership. There had been much discussion. But, until yesterday, no one had stepped up. I applaud my friend Rep. Ted Yoho for putting his name forward as an alternative to the status quo. Ted is a good man for whom I could vote, but I have heard from many supporters and also friends in Congress who have urged me to put forward my name for Speaker as well to increase our chances of change. That is why I am also offering my name as a candidate for Speaker. There is false information being floated that any Republican candidates in addition to the current Speaker will split the vote and give the Speaker\u2019s gavel to Congresswoman Pelosi. This is nothing but a scare tactic to keep the current regime in power. As long as Republicans vote for an adult American citizen for Speaker, no Democrat can win. Only if 59 Republicans voted \u201cPresent\u201d would there be a chance for a Democrat to win. To win the Speaker\u2019s race, an adult American citizen has to get a clear majority of all Members of Congress on the House floor voting for an eligible person. Voting \u201cPresent\u201d simply reduces the number of votes required to win a majority. If no one wins a majority on the first ballot, then we go to a second vote, then a third, until someone gets a majority. At this point, the Speaker\u2019s election is not about a particular candidate. It is about whether we keep the status quo or make the change the country demands. I am putting forward my name for consideration as Speaker and hope that with a new Speaker, be that me or someone else, we can fight for the ideals and principles that the voters wanted when they elected us in November.\n\nIn TheBlaze\u2019s Saturday poll on who should be the House Speaker, Gohmert snagged 16 percent of the vote, putting him firmly at No. 2 on the seven-person list.\n\nTheBlaze readers\u2019 favorite pick among the options provided: South Carolina Republican Trey Gowdy, whose nearly 10,000 votes gave him 70 percent of the poll participants.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Zach Noble (@thezachnoble) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:56:39.612+0000", "event": "articles"}

The director of the political office in the Bush administration testified before this committee, we know that there have been high-level Hatch Act violations under President Obama, and a federal judge has already rejected claims that an official like Mr. Simas enjoys a special immunity above and beyond Executive privilege.\u201d\n\nThe Hatch Act is a law that restricts certain political activities of federal officials while on taxpayer time to ensure that government business is separtate from partisan political activity.\n\nSecretary of Labor Hilda Solis and former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius have both been accused of violating the law to promote President Barack Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection campaign. The violations occurred before Simas took on his role in the White House.\n\nAfter the political office had been closed under Obama in 2011, it was reopened in January this year, and Simas was put in charge.\n\nThe proposed committee resolution says: \u201cWhereas, in a July 18, 2014 letter, the Committee informed White House Counsel, that his contention that Mr. Simas need not appear or testify before the Committee, despite having been compelled to do so by a lawfully issued subpoena, is contrary to well-established law and amounts to contumacious conduct. \u2026 Resolved, That the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform rejects the claim made by the White House that Mr. Simas is immune from congressional compulsion to testify on matters relating to his official duties.\u201d\n\nWhite House Counsel Neil Eggleston rejected a request, then rejected a subpoena for Simas to appear before the committee. Each time Eggleston asserted that Simas had immunity because he was a presidential advisor that was not confirmed by the Senate and thus could not be compelled to testify.\n\n\u201cYour rush to subpoena Mr. Simas illustrates the committee\u2019s refusal to pursue its oversight function in a responsible and deliberate manner. Moreover, the committee has fallen far short of justifying its request than an immediate presidential advisor testify at a hearing,\u201d Eggleston said in a letter to Issa Thursday.\n\nIssa points out that the George W. Bush administration made a similar contention to prevent then-White House Counsel Harriet Miers from testifying to a Democratic Congress and the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in a 2008 opinion rejected the claim of executive immunity.\n\n\u201cI expect our committee will reject President Obama\u2019s assertion that his White House should be afforded special treatment that House Democrats did not extend to Republican administrations when they were in the majority,\u201d Issa said.\n\nBut Eggleston said that doesn\u2019t apply in this case.\n\n\u201cI was advised by the Department of Justice that, after thoroughly considering the District Court\u2019s reasoning in Miers, the department continues to believe that the executive branch\u2019s longstanding position on immunity of immediate presidential advisors applies in the circumstances here and is correct as a matter of constitutional law,\u201d Eggleston said in the letter to Issa Thursday.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:57:12.648+0000", "event": "articles"}

The conversations, often fielded by Mr. Biden\u2019s chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, have taken place in hushed phone calls and over quiet lunches. In most cases they have grown out of an outpouring of sympathy for the vice president since the death of his 46-year-old son, Beau, in May.\n\nIn a Times column, Maureen Dowd repeated the reasoning, even relaying a conversation Joe and Beau had before Beau\u2019s recent death:\n\nJoe Biden is also talking to friends, family and donors about jumping in. The 72-year-old vice president has been having meetings at his Washington residence to explore the idea of taking on Hillary in Iowa and New Hampshire. [...] But going through the crucible of the loss of his oldest son, Beau, to brain cancer made the vice president consider the quest again. As a little boy, Beau helped get his father through the tragedy of losing his beautiful first wife and 13-month-old daughter in the car crash that injured Beau and his brother, Hunter. When Beau realized he was not going to make it, he asked his father if he had a minute to sit down and talk. \u201cOf course, honey,\u201d the vice president replied. At the table, Beau told his dad he was worried about him.

{"entityId": 550, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "As the investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails intensified on Wednesday, the Democratic presidential candidate\u2019s campaign attempted to reassure supporters there was no classified information on her private server and attacked her Republican opponents.\n\nAn email message from Clinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palemieri stated, \u201cYou might hear some news over the next few days about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails.\u201d\n\n\u201cHillary didn\u2019t send any classified materials over email: Hillary only used her personal account for unclassified email,\u201d Palemieri said in the message that went out Wednesday. \u201cNo information in her emails was marked classified at the time she sent or received them. She viewed classified materials in hard copy in her office or via other secure means while traveling, not on email.\u201d\n\nThe campaign announced Tuesday that Clinton was providing her private email server to the FBI, which is reviewing whether any classified information was sent or received on the private server while she served as secretary of state. At least two of the emails that came through Clinton\u2019s insecure home email server, were deemed \u201cTop Secret, Sensitive Compartmented Information,\u201d which is among the government\u2019s highest classifications, according to the inspector general of the intelligence community.\n\nThe talking points also go after Republican presidential candidates and Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.), chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s worth noting: Many of the Republican candidates for president have done the same things for which they\u2019re now criticizing Hillary,\u201d the talking points said. \u201cAs governor, Jeb Bush owned his own private server and his staff decided which emails he turned over as work-related from his private account. Bobby Jindal went a step further, using private email to communicate with his immediate staff but refusing to release his work-related emails. Scott Walker and Rick Perry had email issues themselves.\u201d\n\nThe message directs readers to a \u201cfact sheet\u201d about the email controversy.\n\nOn Benghazi, the Clinton campaign used the phrase \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the Benghazi committee? While you may hear from the Republican-led Benghazi committee about Hillary\u2019s emails, it is important to remember that the committee was formed to focus on learning lessons from Benghazi to help prevent future tragedies at our embassies and consulates around the globe,\u201d Palemieri\u2019s message said. \u201cInstead, the committee, led by Republican Representative Trey Gowdy, is spending nearly $6 million in taxpayer money to conduct a partisan witch-hunt designed to do political damage to Hillary in the run-up to the election.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not a surprise to see the Clinton campaign defense ignore \u201cinconvenient facts,\u201d Benghazi select committee spokesman Jamal Ware told TheBlaze.\n\n\u201cThe Intelligence Community Inspector General nominated by President Obama and confirmed by the Senate when it was controlled by Democrats determined emails on Secretary Clinton\u2019s server contained Top Secret, compartmented intelligence information, not the Benghazi Committee,\u201d Ware said.\n\n\u201cThat determination was confirmed by the proper interagency process and classification authorities, and its implications are being investigated by the FBI. It is not surprising then to see those around Secretary Clinton launch desperate political attacks against the Benghazi Committee to distract from these inconvenient facts,\u201d he added. \u201cThe Benghazi Committee uncovered her unusual email arrangement with herself, but it is Secretary Clinton who chose to set up this unprecedented arrangement, and she alone bears responsibility for the consequences of that choice.\u201d\n\nTheBlaze also reached out to the Republican presidential candidates attacked in the email, as well as Clinton\u2019s Democratic primary opponents about the email matter.\n\n\u201cWe followed the law and comply with all public records requests \u2014 which cannot be said about Secretary Clinton, who swore to protect the United States and its interests, but instead chose to be reckless with classified documents and our national security,\u201d Jindal spokeswoman Shannon Dirmann told TheBlaze. \u201cShe is one e-mail away from going to jail.\u201d\n\nA source close to the Walker campaign said: \u201cThe heart of the matter is whether Clinton\u2019s exclusive use of private email put classified information at risk. The Intelligence Community Inspector General\u2019s contention that top secret information was found on her private server proves Hillary Clinton put her own personal convenience ahead of the safety and security of the American people. Therefore, she cannot be trusted to be commander in chief.\u201d\n\nClinton\u2019s leading Democratic opponent is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, whose campaign was reluctant to weigh in.\n\n\u201cThe senator\u2019s focus remains on how to help the middle class and take on the billionaire class,\u201d Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs told TheBlaze.\n\nWhile the FBI is looking into the matter, the Clinton campaign further sought to ease concerns that this was a criminal investigation.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, there is absolutely no criminal inquiry into Hillary\u2019s email or email server. Any and all reports to that effect have been widely debunked,\u201d the message said. \u201cHillary directed her team to provide her email server and a thumb drive in order to cooperate with the review process and to ensure these materials were stored in a safe and secure manner.\u201d\n\nThe message added, \u201cLike other Secretaries of State who served before her, Hillary used a personal email address, and the rules of the State Department permitted it.\u201d\n\nIn this portion, the message does not mention that Clinton used a private server.\n\nBut the message repeated Clinton\u2019s earlier assertion about hindsight, saying, \u201cShe\u2019s already acknowledged that, in hindsight, it would have been better just to use separate work and personal email accounts. No one disputes that.\u201d\n\nThis post was updated to include comment from the presidential campaigns of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and Vermont Sen.

{"entityId": 555, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski\n\nBOSTON (AP) \u2014 Former U.S. Sen. Edward W. Brooke, a liberal Republican who became the first black in U.S. history to win popular election to the Senate, died Saturday. He was 95.\n\nBrooke died of natural causes at his Coral Gables, Florida, home, said Ralph Neas, a former Brooke aide. Brooke was surrounded by his family.\n\nBrooke was elected to the Senate in 1966, becoming the first black to sit in that branch from any state since Reconstruction and one of nine blacks who have ever served there \u2014 including Barack Obama.\n\nBrooke told The Associated Press he was \u201cthankful to God\u201d that he lived to see Obama\u2019s election. And the president was on hand in October 2009 when Brooke was presented with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award Congress has to honor civilians. Obama hailed Brooke as \u201ca man who\u2019s spent his life breaking barriers and bridging divides across this country.\u201d\n\nA Republican in a largely Democratic state, Brooke was one of Massachusetts\u2019 most popular political figures during most of his 12 years in the Senate.\n\nBrooke earned his reputation as a Senate liberal in part by becoming the first Republican senator to publicly urge President Richard Nixon to resign. He told ABC News that Nixon had \u201clost the confidence of the country and I don\u2019t know of anything he could do to turn it around.\u201d\n\nHe helped lead the forces in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment and was a defender of school busing to achieve racial integration, a bitterly divisive issue in Boston.\n\nHe also lent his name to the Brooke amendment to the federal housing act, passed in 1969, which limited to 25 percent the amount of income a family must pay for rent in public housing.\n\nHowever, late in his second term, Brooke divorced his wife of 31 years, Remigia, in a stormy proceeding that attracted national attention.\n\nRepercussions from the case spurred an investigation into his personal finances by the Senate Ethics Committee and a probe by the state welfare department and ultimately cost him the 1978 election. He was defeated by Democrat Rep. Paul E. Tsongas.\n\nIn a Boston Globe interview in 2000, he recalled the pain of losing his bid for a third term.\n\n\u201cIt was just a divorce case. It was never about my work in the Senate. There was never a charge that I committed a crime, or even nearly committed a crime,\u201d Brooke said. \u201cI would certainly not be truthful if I didn\u2019t say I was sorely hurt when the people of Massachusetts voted against me and didn\u2019t look beyond the allegations and didn\u2019t remember what I had tried to do for them.\u201d\n\nIn 2008, Barbara Walters said she had an affair with the then-married Brooke in the 1970s, but it ended before he lost the 1978 election. She called him \u201cexciting\u201d and \u201cbrilliant.\u201d\n\nThe first blacks served in the Senate in the 1870s, just after the Civil War, when senators were still selected by state legislatures rather than by popular election. Mississippi\u2019s postwar legislators sent two blacks to the Senate. Hiram R. Revels served about 14 months in 1870-71, and Blanche K. Bruce served a full six-year term from 1875 to 81.\n\nNot long before Obama was sworn in as president, Brooke told the AP that he had been frequently asked if he thought Obama could be elected.\n\n\u201c\u2026a man who\u2019s spent his life breaking barriers and bridging divides across this country.\u201d Share:\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d say I\u2019m the last person to say it couldn\u2019t happen. I\u2019ve already shown that white voters are open to voting for black candidates, so it made sense to me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThough I was pleased, I\u2019m not that surprised that he was able to pull it off. But I am thankful to God to live to see this happen.\u201d\n\nWhen Brooke received the congressional honor in Washington later in the year, he cited the issues facing Congress \u2014 health care, the economy and the wars overseas \u2014 and called on lawmakers to put their partisan differences aside.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to get together,\u201d Brooke said, turning his eyes to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. \u201cWe have no alternative.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) plans to spend part of Wednesday evening persuading a group of House republicans to oppose House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s proposed immigration package set to hit the House floor on Thursday, according to a Washington Post report.\n\nCiting \u201cseveral House members\u201d who plan to attend a 7 p.m. meeting at Cruz\u2019s office, the Post reports that Cruz is seemingly acting as an informal whip, meddling in the House\u2019s affairs in a bid to derail Boehner\u2019s immigration bill. Reps. Steve King (R-Iowa), Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.), Matt Salmon (R-Ariz.) and more than 12 other House Republicans reportedly plan to attend the meeting, which will be closed to the press.\n\nBoehner\u2019s House $659 million proposal makes it easier to deport young illegal immigrants and would also dispatch National Guard troops to the border. The measure would cost significantly less than the $3.7 billion President Barack Obama first requested.\n\nCruz has argued that Congress shouldn\u2019t pass any bill that doesn\u2019t fully repeal Obama\u2019s Deferred Action for Child Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to receive work permits.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, Cruz said the \u201conly way to stop the border crisis is to stop Obama\u2019s amnesty. It is disappointing the border security legislation unveiled today does not include language to end Obama\u2019s amnesty. Congress cannot hope to solve this problem without addressing the fundamental cause of it.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile in the Senate, lawmakers voted 63-33 on Wednesday to advance a $3.5 billion emergency spending bill over an initial procedural hurdle. But with Republicans and a few Democrats opposed, there was little expectation that the legislation would ultimately prevail with only days left before Congress\u2019 annual August recess.\n\nEven if it did, the Senate bill is at odds with a competing measure in the House that has a smaller price tag and includes contentious policy changes the Senate bill ignores. That measure drew a veto threat from the White House on Wednesday.\n\nRepublicans called the Senate measure a blank check for President Barack Obama\u2019s failed policies and demanded policy changes opposed by Democrats to send the migrants back home more quickly. The bill also includes hundreds of millions of dollars to fight western wildfires and $225 million to help Israeli self-defense, but lawmakers were making plans to deal with the money for Israel separately.\n\nStill, Republicans and Democrats alike said the crisis of tens of thousands of unaccompanied Central American youths crossing illegally into South Texas demanded a response. Some Republicans voted in favor of moving forward Wednesday, saying they wanted to open debate on the measure in order to be able to offer amendments, though Democrats were expected to oppose such efforts.\n\n\u201cMy constituents back home don\u2019t understand why in the world we would leave without fixing this problem,\u201d said Sen.

{"entityId": 582, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker has been surging in some recent Republican 2016 polls, but is rousing a new controversy in his home state, this time regarding Common Core.\n\nWalker\u2019s budget proposal calls for doing away with the Smarter Balanced test, the exam given to students in grades three through eight under Common Core, sparking objections from some school administrators in his state. However, for parents and teachers around the country opposed to the standards, Walker\u2019s positions could bode well in Republican primaries \u2014 unlike those of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has reiterated his support for Common Core. Meanwhile, other likely Republican candidates have done an about-face on the issue.\n\nAn NBC/Marist poll earlier this month found that Walker and Bush are the only candidates polling in double digits in all three of the earliest GOP contests, Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nThe Common Core K-12 math and English standards were developed by the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers and the Obama administration\u2019s Department of Education has tied its \u201cRace to the Top\u201d school grants to states that have adopted the standards. After initial widespread adoption of Common Core among most of the states, Indiana, South Carolina and Oklahoma last year dropped the standards altogether, while others are either reviewing them or making changes.\n\nHere\u2019s an overview of where the likely 2016 Republican candidates stand on Common Core:\n\nBobby Jindal\u2019s Aggressive Opposition\n\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, though not currently a top-tier GOP contender in most polls, has been the most active potential candidate in opposing Common Core. He led the state\u2019s lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education to stop making federal education dollars contingent on adopting the standards and has made several speeches about the controversial standards. Critics have been quick to point out, however, that Jindal was initially a supporter of the standards, though he has said that was before the federal government became involved.\n\nJeb Bush: Not Backing Down\n\nBush has thus far not backed down from his strong support for Common Core, though he has recently talked more broadly about some of the principles behind them, while avoiding calling the standards by their name.\n\nRand Paul: \u2018Rotten to the Core\u2019\n\nKentucky Sen. Rand Paul was one of the first potential opponents to warn Bush that his support for Common Core would be a problem in the Republican primaries. Paul\u2019s political action committee was clear on where the senator stands, having sent out fundraising email blasting Common Core, with the subject line, \u201cRotten to the Core.\u201d It also named Bush, Walker, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee as \u201cprominent backers\u201d of Common Core.\n\nScott Walker: From Repeal to Opposing Mandates\n\nWalker initially called for a legislative repeal of Common Core in Wisconsin, but scaled that back in December after he was elected to a second term, saying his goal is to remove \u201cany mandate or requirement that requires a school district to abide by Common Core standards.\u201d The proposal on the tests is his latest action regarding the standards.\n\nChris Christie: New \u2018Grave Concerns\u2019\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in 2013, \u201cWe are doing Common Core in New Jersey and we\u2019re going to continue.\u201d But last week in Iowa, Christie revealed second thoughts, saying the \u201centire nature\u201d of the standards changed when Obama began to tie education dollars to adopting the standards. Christie said Common Core should be a voluntary program and said he has \u201cgrave concerns\u201d about how the Obama administration has handled the matter.\n\nMike Huckabee: Common Core \u2018Morphed Into a Frankenstandard\u2019\n\nFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has long been criticized as a supporter of Common Core, but last month in Iowa, he said the standards are not what they were intended to be.\n\n\u201cFolks, what Common Core may have originally been was a governor-controlled states initiative to keep the fickle federal fingers of fate off of education,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cIt has morphed into a frankenstandard that nobody, including me, can support.\u201d\n\nHuckabee added, \u201cAnybody who tells you I support Common Core is incredibly less informed than he or she pretends to be or is just being plain dishonest because they really want to help somebody else.\u201d\n\nTed Cruz\u2019s Priority\n\nLast month, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz released his list of the top 10 Republican goals, with No. 9, \u201cWe need to repeal Common Core.\u201d He added that the federal government should not dictate education policy to states.\n\nMarco Rubio: \u2018Not Just With Common Core\u2019\n\nWhen asked about the topic, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Fox News last month that whether it\u2019s Common Core or another program, he is wary of federal intervention.\n\n\u201cMy concern \u2014 not just with Common Core, it\u2019s in general \u2014 is that we all of a sudden create some sort of standard that the federal government uses as a requirement to impose on the states,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nBen Carson: Keep it Local\n\nDr. Ben Carson, when asked about Common Core, said education is better handled at the local level rather than remotely. He added that the Constitution does not give the federal government a role in education.\n\nKasich: No \u2018Hysteria\u2019 for Repeal\n\nAside from Bush, Ohio Gov. John Kasich is the only other potential GOP contender who is standing firmly behind Common Core.\n\n\u201cWe have carried it out. We have higher standards. We want our kids to perform better and do better,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cThe standards are determined by our local school boards. There is total local control.

{"entityId": 587, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans will hold at least 246 House seats come January, according to election results Saturday, giving the GOP a commanding majority that matches the party\u2019s post-World War II high during Democratic President Harry S. Truman\u2019s administration.\n\nThe GOP retained control of two seats in runoffs in Louisiana, expanding the advantage for Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, who can afford defections from his increasingly conservative caucus and still get legislation passed. Combined with the Republican takeover of the Senate, Congress will be all-GOP for the final two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term.\n\nThe latest count gives the GOP a 246-188 majority. One race, in Arizona, is still outstanding.\n\nIn Louisiana\u2019s 5th Congressional District, which extends from the state\u2019s northeast into parishes bordering Mississippi, physician Ralph Abraham defeated Jamie Mayo, the Democratic mayor of Monroe. The incumbent, Vance McAllister, had failed to advance to the runoff. Elected less than a year ago, the married McAllister saw his career undermined after a video surfaced earlier this year showing him kissing another woman.\n\nIn the 6th Congressional District, in the Baton Rouge area, former state coastal restoration chief Garret Graves turned back Democrat Edwin Edwards, a four-term governor and ex-congressman who had to overcome his 2000 corruption conviction and subsequent prison term.\n\nOne race still must be decided.\n\nIn a Democratic-held district in the Tucson, Arizona-area, an automatic recount will determine whether Rep. Ron Barber keeps his seat or Republican challenger Martha McSally prevails. McSally led by fewer than 200 votes.\n\nIf McSally wins, Republicans would have 247 seats, the largest majority since 1929-31 when the GOP controlled 270 seats in President Herbert Hoover\u2019s administration.\n\nIn the midterm election rout, House Republicans prevailed on Democratic turf, netting 12 seats and winning in New York, Illinois, Maine, New Hampshire and Iowa. Republican challengers knocked out long-term Democratic incumbents in Georgia and West Virginia, seats that the GOP now could hold for generations as the party maintains its stranglehold on the South.\n\nThe GOP had entered the Nov. 4 midterm elections with a 234-201 edge. Democrats had held out hope of minimizing their losses despite Obama\u2019s low popularity and historic losses for the party occupying the White House. Democrats did manage to win three Republican-held seats in California, Florida and Nebraska, but Republicans had far greater success around the country.\n\nThe 246 seats match the total the GOP had in 1947-49 when Truman occupied the White House.\n\nObama suffered an ignominious distinction.

{"entityId": 595, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. (AP) \u2014 Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy has defeated Democratic Sen. Mary Landrieu, denying her a fourth term and extending the GOP\u2019s domination of the 2014 midterm elections that put Republicans in charge of Capitol Hill for the final two years of President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure.\n\nWith Cassidy\u2019s victory, Republicans will hold 54 seats when the Senate convenes in January, nine more than they have now. Republican victories in two Louisiana House districts Saturday \u2014 including the seat Cassidy now holds \u2014 ensure at least 246 seats, compared to 188 for Democrats, the largest GOP advantage since the Truman administration after World War II. An Arizona recount leaves one race still outstanding.\n\nIn Louisiana, early returns showed Cassidy with a wide lead.\n\nLandrieu had narrowly led a Nov. 4 primary ballot that included eight candidates from all parties. But at 42 percent, she fell well below her marks in previous races and endured a one-month runoff campaign that Republicans dominated via the air waves while national Democrats financially abandoned her effort.\n\nLandrieu\u2019s defeat is a blow for one of Louisiana\u2019s most famous political families, leaving her brother, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu, to carry the banner. The GOP sweep also denied former Gov. Edwin Edwards a political comeback; the colorful 87-year-old politician, who had served four terms as governor, sought a return to public office after eight years in federal prison on corruption charges.\n\nIn the South, Democrats will be left without a single governor or U.S. senator across nine states stretching from the Carolinas to Texas. The House delegations from the same region are divided almost entirely by race, with white Republicans representing majority-white districts, while majority non-white districts are represented by black or Hispanic Democrats.\n\nThe Louisiana Senate race mirrored contests in other states Obama lost in 2012, with Landrieu, 59, joining Alaska Sen. Mark Begich, North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan and Arkansas Sen. Mark Pryor in defeat. Democrats ceded seats in Montana, South Dakota and West Virginia after incumbents opted not to run again.\n\nLike victorious Republicans in those races, Cassidy, 57, made his bid against Landrieu more about Obama than about his own vision for the job. An Illinois native, Cassidy made few public appearances during the runoff, seeking to avoid missteps that could change the race.\n\nBut in a state where 73 percent of white voters on Nov. 4 told pollsters they \u201cstrongly disapproved\u201d of the president, that was enough to prevent Landrieu from finding her footing. Cassidy also enjoyed a prodigious advertising advantage in the runoff: Of every dollar spent by outside groups during the one-month runoff, 97 cents benefited the congressman.\n\nLandrieu tried several messages over the course of her losing effort.\n\nMost recently, she had hammered Cassidy as unfit for the job and interested more in partisanship than helping Louisiana. She directed her most pointed criticism at Cassidy\u2019s medical teaching job with the Louisiana State University hospital system. Calling Cassidy \u201cDr. Double Dip,\u201d Landrieu suggested the congressman collected a $20,000, taxpayer-funded salary for little or no work, describing gaps and discrepancies in Cassidy\u2019s LSU timesheets. LSU said it\u2019s looking into the timesheet questions.\n\nShe argued that the race shouldn\u2019t be about Obama, but also targeted advertising on radio stations geared to the black community, where the president remains popular.\n\nHer anchor argument was that her seniority was a boon for Louisiana, particularly her chairmanship of the Senate\u2019s energy committee, an important panel for this oil-rich state. But that argument was gutted on Nov. 4 when Republicans won the Senate majority, meaning Landrieu would have lost her post even had she won.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:58:29.225+0000", "event": "articles"}

Jeb Bush in most polls in New Hampshire.\n\nMany analysts view Walker as a candidate who could unite the conservative wing of the Republican Party with the establishment. Even before becoming governor, Walker was elected county executive in the heavily Democratic Milwaukee County.\n\nHe has come under fire for changing his position on immigration, having shown openness to a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d for illegals in the past.

Blood coming out of her \u2014 wherever,\u201d Trump told CNN Friday evening.\n\nErickson wrote, \u201cHis comment was inappropriate. It is unfortunate to have to disinvite him. But I just don\u2019t want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal. It just was wrong.\u201d\n\nThe RedState editor added that while he had asked Kelly to take Trump\u2019s place, he was not sure she would be able to make it since it was a last minute invite.\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from TheBlaze.\n\nIn a statement to The Guardian, however, a Trump campaign spokesperson blasted Erickson.\n\n\u201cThis is just another example of weakness through being politically correct. For all of the people who were looking forward to Mr. Trump coming, we will miss you. Blame Erick Erickson, your weak and pathetic leader. We\u2019ll now be doing another campaign stop at another location,\u201d the spokesperson said.\n\nErickson was not the only person to go after Trump for his Friday remark against Kelly.

Those being:\n\n1. A nation without borders is not a nation. There must be a wall across the southern border. 2. A nation without laws is not a nation. Laws passed in accordance with our Constitutional system of government must be enforced. 3. A nation that does not serve its own citizens is not a nation. Any immigration plan must improve jobs, wages and security for all Americans.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan would deny citizenship to the babies of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally as part of an immigration plan that emphasizes border security and deportation for millions.\n\nTrump described his expanded vision of how to secure American borders during a wide-ranging interview Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet The Press,\u201d saying that he would push to end the constitutionally protected citizenship rights of children of any family living illegally inside the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey have to go,\u201d Trump said, adding: \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing, they\u2019re having a baby. And then all of a sudden, nobody knows \u2026 the baby\u2019s here.\u201d\n\nNative-born children of immigrants \u2014 even those living illegally in the U.S. \u2014 have been automatically considered American citizens since the adoption of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution in 1868.\n\nThe odds of repealing the amendment\u2019s citizenship clause would be steep, requiring the votes of two-thirds of both houses of Congress and support from three-fourths of the nation\u2019s state legislatures. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed since 2011 to pass bills aimed at ending \u201cbirthright citizenship.\u201d Some conservatives believe that the granting of citizenship in such cases could be changed without amending the Constitution.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re illegal,\u201d Trump said, describing native-born children of people living illegally in the U.S. \u201cYou either have a country or not.\u201d\n\nTrump said he would also rescind Obama administration executive orders on immigration.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan details how he would have Mexico pay for a wall, citing first the ill economic effects and criminal activity that illegal immigration has contributed to in America, while saying that Mexico has profited from the current system.\n\n\u201cThe costs for the United States have been extraordinary: U.S. taxpayers have been asked to pick up hundreds of billions in healthcare costs, housing costs, education costs, welfare costs, etc. Indeed, the annual cost of free tax credits alone paid to illegal immigrants quadrupled to $4.2 billion in 2011. The effects on jobseekers have also been disastrous, and black Americans have been particularly harmed,\u201d his position statement read.\n\n\u201cIn short, the Mexican government has taken the United States to the cleaners. They are responsible for this problem, and they must help pay to clean it up,\u201d his statement continued.\n\nUntil Mexico pays for a wall, Trump\u2019s plan would \u201cimpound all remittance payments derived from illegal wages; increase fees on all temporary visas issued to Mexican CEOs and diplomats (and if necessary cancel them); increase fees on all border crossing cards \u2013 of which we issue about 1 million to Mexican nationals each year (a major source of visa overstays); increase fees on all NAFTA worker visas from Mexico (another major source of overstays); and increase fees at ports of entry to the United States from Mexico [Tariffs and foreign aid cuts are also options].\u201d\n\nHere are a few other key points from Trump\u2019s position statement. He said he would:\n\nT riple the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, funded by \u201celiminating tax credit payments to illegal immigrants.\u201d\n\nInstitute an e-verify system for legal employment. He also said he would require immigrants to prove they could pay for their own housing, health care and more to end abuse of the welfare system.\n\nEnd catch-and-release, instead detaining illegal immigrants until they are deported.\n\nCut off federal funding to cities who refuse to comply with these immigration rules.\n\nTrump\u2019s plan also detailed how he would require businesses to hire from the pool of unemployed Americans before issuing H-1B visas.\n\n\u201cPetitions for workers should be mailed to the unemployment office, not [United States Citizenship and Immigration Services,]\u201d he wrote.\n\nHis policy was endorsed by Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) who chairs a Senate subcommittee on immigration.\n\n\u201cThis is exactly the plan America needs,\u201d Sessions said in a statement. \u201cCrucially, this plan includes an emphasis on lifting struggling minority communities, including our immigrant communities, out of poverty, by preventing corporations from bringing in new workers from overseas to replace them and drive down wages.\u201d\n\nRead Trump\u2019s full position on immigration reform.\n\n\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:58:43.856+0000", "event": "articles"}

The former Florida governor puts \u201crising wages\u201d front and center on the website of the political committee that\u2019s essentially his campaign-in-waiting.\n\n\u201cToo many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp,\u201d Bush\u2019s site says. \u201cWhile the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top earners, they\u2019ve been a lost decade for the rest of America.\u201d\n\nAs for Warren, who continues to the dismay of some liberals to insist she will not enter the 2016 race, her populist message about wages and income inequality may be pushing Clinton from afar. See Clinton\u2019s tweet, which opened with a defense of Warren\u2019s assault on Wall Street\u2019s large investment banks, which has been at the core of her work in the Senate.\n\nTo be sure, presidential campaigns often become a proxy fight over the health of the nation\u2019s economy. It was the staff of Clinton\u2019s husband who, during his first campaign for president against Bush\u2019s father, George H.W. Bush, summed up their strategy in three words: \u201cThe economy, stupid.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why others who are talking about running for president are not straying far from an economic message at this stage of the campaign. Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s speech Friday to the Republican National Committee was all about his state\u2019s record of job creation during his time in office. If you\u2019ve heard Perry talking about the \u201cTexas Miracle\u201d before, it\u2019s because he rarely misses an opportunity to do so.\n\n\u201cI got 14 years of preparation as governor running the most successful state in the nation,\u201d Perry said.\n\nIn their state of the state speeches this week, both Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie touted drops in their state\u2019s unemployment rate under their watch.\n\n\u201cVoters, particularly in presidential contests, want their candidates to be able to answer in the affirmative the question, \u2018Does this person understand the problems of people like me?\u2019\u201d said Romney adviser Kevin Madden. \u201cThis is a departure from the last campaign, where the focus was on drawing contrasts with the president and reminding voters what they didn\u2019t like or shouldn\u2019t like about Obama\u2019s economic record.\u201d\n\nBut it\u2019s the populist message on wages that appear especially ripe for this moment. American\u2019s rate their own finances a bit worse than they did at the start of Obama\u2019s time in office, according to an Associated Press-GfK poll taken at the end of last year, with half of those under 30 describing themselves as poor. While a majority feels the stock market and big businesses have mostly recovered from the Great Recession, only 34 percent say their family is largely back to normal.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an opening for Republicans,\u201d said Republican strategist and former Minnesota congressman Vin Weber, who like Romney said Obama hadn\u2019t reduced poverty in America during his first six years in office.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a difference between the Democratic message and Republican message on this issue\u201d Share:\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s got to be a difference between the Democratic message and Republican message on this issue,\u201d he added. \u201cRepublicans need to focus on restoring social mobility \u2014 the notion that everybody in this country could rise.\u201d\n\nWhat comes next, of course, is the policy prescriptions of the candidates. Romney didn\u2019t offer any specific ideas during his speech on Friday, but still used the opportunity to take a shot at the ideas of Democrats. \u201cTheir liberal policies are good every four years for a campaign, but they don\u2019t get the job done,\u201d Romney said.\n\nDuring the recent midterm election campaign, Clinton often spoke of the need to return to an economic system of broadly shared prosperity. But she\u2019s yet to say much about what precisely she would do as president to address wage inequality and middle-class jobs.\n\nWhich, to be fair, isn\u2019t unexpected. The Iowa Caucus is still more than a year away, and none of the people who are talking about running for president and acting like they\u2019re running for president have actually launched a formal campaign. The details will come later.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Dave Urbanski (@DaveVUrbanski) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:58:56.460+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 632, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "For Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address, President Barack Obama will make proposals such as a tax hike for the wealthy, free community college and other ideas that will have little chance of passing a Republican-led Congress. But the president didn\u2019t even have a very good record from last year\u2019s speech, when at least the Senate was held by the Democrats.\n\nOf more than 20 proposals President Obama asked Congress to pass during his 2014 State of the Union address, the House and Senate approved two. But Obama, not surprisingly, made good on his pledge to take sweeping executive action on several fronts. During last year\u2019s speech, Obama asked Congress to pass a bill on manufacturing hubs and to fund a federal jobs training program. Congress passed both fairly noncontroversial measures, but Obama\u2019s other goals were less than successful.\n\nHere are the 10 biggest failures from the 2014 address that was themed, \u201cYear of Action.\u201d\n\n1. Mixed on Minimum Wage\n\nThe minimum wage was a key part of the the 2014 speech. Obama was true to his promise in issuing an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay workers $10.10 per hour, but said that would\u2019t be enough.\n\n\u201cOf course, to reach millions more, Congress needs to get on board,\u201d Obama said. Congress did not raise the minimum wage, and the Congressional Budget Office warned it would cost jobs.\n\n2. Equal Pay\n\nAmong the more memorable lines from the 2014 State of the Union was, \u201cIt\u2019s time to do away with workplace policies that belong in a \u2018Mad Men\u2019 episode.\u201d\n\nThat was followed by: \u201cThis year, let\u2019s all come together \u2013 Congress, the White House, and businesses from Wall Street to Main Street \u2013 to give every woman the opportunity she deserves. Because I firmly believe when women succeed, America succeeds.\u201d\n\nBut the White House-backed Paycheck Fairness Act, which made it easier for women to sue their employer for alleged gender discrimination, failed even to pass a Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\n3. Immigration\n\nObama told Congress: \u201cIf we are serious about economic growth, it is time to heed the call of business leaders, labor leaders, faith leaders, and law enforcement \u2013 and fix our broken immigration system.\u2026 So let\u2019s get immigration reform done this year.\u201d\n\nCongress did not act on a bill providing a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d for 11 million illegals, so after the midterm elections, Obama took executive actions to shield 5 million illegals from deportation.\n\nThe immigration actions were not among the laundry list of executive actions he promised in the 2014 address.\n\n4. Obama Asked Congress for Tax Reform Last Year\n\nObama is pitching a tax reform package in his State of the Union Tuesday, asking Congress to do away with certain tax loopholes and raise taxes on the wealthy. Last year, he also called for Congress to make a more modest move.\n\n\u201cBoth Democrats and Republicans have argued that our tax code is riddled with wasteful, complicated loopholes that punish businesses investing here, and reward companies that keep profits abroad. Let\u2019s flip that equation,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s work together to close those loopholes, end those incentives to ship jobs overseas, and lower tax rates for businesses that create jobs here at home.\u201d\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cLet\u2019s continue that progress with a smarter tax policy that stops giving $4 billion a year to fossil fuel industries that don\u2019t need it, so that we can invest more in fuels of the future that do.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s Treasury Department took actions against companies that were incorporating abroad to avoid the high U.S. corporate tax rate. But Congress didn\u2019t pass any law on tax reform.\n\n5. Another Call for Universal Pre-K\n\n\u201cResearch shows that one of the best investments we can make in a child\u2019s life is high-quality early education,\u201d Obama said in 2014. \u201cLast year, I asked this Congress to help states make high-quality pre-K available to every four year-old. As a parent as well as a president, I repeat that request tonight.\u201d\n\nNo congressional action on universal pre-school, but the administration did take executive action to promote more state spending on pre-K.\n\n6. EITC for Single People\n\nObama asked Congress to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, created for poor families, to single individuals as well.\n\n\u201cRight now, it helps about half of all parents at some point. But I agree with Republicans like Senator Rubio that it doesn\u2019t do enough for single workers who don\u2019t have kids,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo let\u2019s work together to strengthen the credit, reward work, and help more Americans get ahead.\u201d\n\nCongress didn\u2019t take action, and the credit remains only for families.\n\n7. Retirement Savings\n\nObama told Congress to \u201cOffer every American access to an automatic IRA on the job, so they can save at work just like everyone in this chamber can.\u201d Congress didn\u2019t.\n\nBut the Treasury Department did establish the MyRA program to help people without a 401k plan start retirement savings through new savings bond that Obama said last year, \u201cguarantees a decent return with no risk of losing what you put in.\u201d\n\n8. Gun Regulations\n\nObama told Congress last year, \u201cI intend to keep trying, with or without Congress, to help stop more tragedies from visiting innocent Americans in our movie theaters, shopping malls, or schools like Sandy Hook.\u201d\n\nCongress stayed away from the gun issue. But Obama issued some executive actions.\n\nHe directed the Department of Justice to clarify rules on who is prohibited from buying a gun under existing federal law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Health and Human Services required states to submit more information on individuals through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which was previously withheld under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPPA, which protects medical privacy.\n\nIn October Obama issued an executive order making it more difficult to fire employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, by allowing more ATF employees to be converted to career-employees classifications and eligible for civil service protections.\n\n9. Voting Rights\n\nObama said the Supreme Court undermined the Voting Rights Act, but called on Congress pass proposals of his bipartisan commission. \u201cI appointed last year has offered reforms so that no one has to wait more than a half hour to vote. Let\u2019s support these efforts.\u201d\n\nBut no congressional authorization came for his commission\u2019s plan.\n\n10. Surveillance Reform\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why, working with this Congress, I will reform our surveillance programs \u2013 because the vital work of our intelligence community depends on public confidence, here and abroad, that the privacy of ordinary people is not being violated,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe White House released a detailed plan on surveillance reform, but Congress did not pass new laws.\n\nObama yet again called on Congress to close the Guantanamo prison for terror suspects, and for more infrastructure funding, requests he has made since becoming president. He also asked Congress for more research and development funding, to expand unemployment insurance, for housing incentives, for trade agreements, for funding for alternative energy fueling stations, and for patent reform. None of these proposals went anywhere in Congress.\n\nHowever, he did keep his promise to take other executive actions to raise fuel efficiency standards, impose new requirements on power plants, capped student loan repayments, and expanded broadband for schools and rural areas.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:59:26.351+0000", "event": "articles"}

She said she had no plans to change it.\n\nA message left for Schnurer at Public Works was not immediately returned on Friday morning. He also didn\u2019t immediately respond to email and Twitter messages.\n\nBurke spokesman Joe Zepecki said the campaign didn\u2019t know of the issue until it was first reported Thursday night by the website Buzzfeed.

(AP) \u2014 Mississippi\u2019s state Republican Party on Wednesday refused to hear challenger Chris McDaniel\u2019s effort to overturn his June 24 GOP runoff loss to U.S. Sen. Thad Cochran. The party says McDaniel would do better taking his challenge to court.\n\nIn a letter to McDaniel\u2019s lawyer, state Republican Party Chairman Joe Nosef wrote that a court is needed to \u201cprotect the rights of the voters as well as both candidates.\u201d\n\nNosef wrote that under state Republican Party bylaws, seven days\u2019 notice has to be given before the executive committee can meet. If the notice went out Wednesday, he wrote, the committee couldn\u2019t convene until Aug. 13, only one day before the deadline for McDaniel to file his complaint with a court.\n\nNosef wrote that the committee would have to determine procedures, decide whether McDaniel had challenged in time, order investigations by county committees, hear \u201cpotentially dozens of witnesses,\u201d examine evidence and vote in one day.\n\n\u201cObviously it is not possible for our committee of 52 volunteers to attempt to engage in such an exercise in a prudent manner in one day,\u201d Nosef wrote. \u201cIn fact, given the extraordinary relief requests of overturning a United States Senate primary in which over 360,000 Mississippians cast votes, the only way to ensure the integrity of the election process and provide a prudent review of this matter is in a court of law.\u201d\n\nMcDaniel, a state senator from Ellisville whose campaign was backed by the tea party, asked the party on Monday to declare him its nominee, saying Cochran\u2019s 7,667-vote victory in the runoff was due to Democratic voters who illegally cast runoff ballots for the six-term incumbent.\n\n\u201cChris McDaniel is very disappointed he will not have the opportunity to present his election challenge before the state Executive Committee, especially in light of the fact that we delivered a physical copy of the challenge to all fifty-two members of the committee,\u201d McDaniel lawyer Mitch Tyner said in a statement. \u201cThe party was the perfect venue in which to hear the challenge since it was responsible for the election, but we will move forward with a judicial review as provided for under Mississippi code.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Cochran did not immediately comment. Nosef did not answer his cellphone or immediately respond to a text message requesting comment.\n\nReferring the issue to court also allows members of the GOP\u2019s executive committee, many of whom have ties to Cochran, to avoid ruling on McDaniel\u2019s challenge. McDaniel supporters have criticized Nosef and even called for his resignation, saying he has favored Cochran despite his claim of neutrality.\n\nMcDaniel could file suit in any county where he feels illegal voting occurred. The state Supreme Court will then appoint a special judge to hear the challenge.\n\nThere\u2019s no deadline to challenge in Mississippi, but state law urges judges to decide primary challenges before general election ballots are printed. State law says sample ballots must be given to local election officials by Sept. 10, which is 55 days before the Nov. 4 general election. That squeezes the timeline for a lawsuit and a new primary runoff. State law says a court could order a new primary even after the general election. The Nov. 4 ballot will also include Democratic former U.S. Rep. Travis Childers and the Reform Party\u2019s Shawn O\u2019Hara.\n\nAny court challenge could lead to a lengthy trial, because McDaniel\u2019s claims cite multiple counties. While Mississippi courts have ordered some new local elections, no court has overturned or ordered a new statewide election in at least the past six decades, according to records reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T03:59:30.566+0000", "event": "articles"}

The President told the Leaders that he would welcome action by the Congress that would aid the overall effort and demonstrate to the world that the United States is united in defeating the threat from ISIL.\u201d\n\nAs the House Judiciary Committee chairman, Goodlatte is the point man in the pending House of Representatives lawsuit alleging Obama\u2019s executive overreach violates the constitutional separation of powers, which he spoke about at a Judicial Watch panel on Tuesday.\n\nThe White House has pointed out that it has complied with the War Powers Act by notifying Congress on actions in Iraq. Some members have said there should be congressional approval, while others \u2013 such as former Justice Department attorney John Yoo \u2013 say the 2002 congressional authorization on Iraq allows the president to proceed with action in Iraq.\n\nTheBlaze asked, in the context of separation of powers, if Obama would need approval from Congress to expand the military operation against the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThis is an area where the president has his strongest stand,\u201d Goodlatte told TheBlaze. \u201cHe is the commander-in-chief of our armed forces under the Constitution. However, the war making power is reserved in Article 1 to the Congress.\u201d\n\nHe said that over time, there has been tension between the executive and legislative branches over war.\n\n\u201cWhen the president needs to act quickly, it wouldn\u2019t be possible to bring the Congress together to debate and pass a resolution for the authority to do certain things,\u201d Goodlatte said. \u201cOn the other hand, other longer term objectives that do allow for time for Congress to be consulted we think do require that Congress be consulted.\u201d\n\nHe cited that former Presidents George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all gained congressional authorization to take military action in certain instances. He said that Congress was left out of a say when the president ordered extended airstrikes in Libya in 2011, and last year failed to get support when he did turn to Congress to support striking Syria over the use of chemical weapons.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama did not do that when he engaged with Libya, and when he then sought to do that in Syria, he got tremendous blowback, bipartisan blowback,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if he\u2019s going to take action in Syria, or a broader range of actions, he should seek Congress\u2019s authorization to take those actions.

The administration also blamed Maliki for fomenting sectarianism.\n\nPanetta said both counts were true of al-Maliki, but he said the U.S. had plenty of leverage to use in negotiating a status of forces agreement to give legal protections to the U.S. soldiers.\n\n\u201cMy fear, as I voiced to the president and others, was that if the country split apart or slid back into the violence that we\u2019d seen in the years immediately following the U.S. invasion, it could become a new haven for terrorists to plot attacks against the U.S.,\u201d Panetta says.\n\nUnder Secretary of Defense Mich\u00e8le Flournoy advocated directly with the White House for a residual force in Iraq, which Panetta said the Joint Chiefs also preferred.\n\n\u201cBut the president\u2019s team at the White House pushed back, and the differences occasionally became heated,\u201d Panetta writes. \u201cFlournoy argued our case, and those on our side viewed the White House as so eager to rid itself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in arrangements that would preserve our influence and interests.\u201d\n\nPanetta is the second former Obama defense secretary to write a memoir critical of the administration. Robert Gates, a Republican who ran the Pentagon overlapping the end of the Bush administration and the beginning of the Obama administration, was critical on several fronts in his book, \u201cDuty,\u201d earlier this year.\n\nBut this criticism could prove more stinging given Panetta is a Democrat with a political past, having been elected to the U.S. House before serving as President Bill Clinton\u2019s budget director and White House chief of staff.\n\n\u201cTo my frustration, the White House coordinated the negotiations but never really led them,\u201d he writes, later adding: \u201cThe deal never materialized. To this day, I believe that a small U.S. troop presence in Iraq could have effectively advised the Iraqi military on how to deal with Al Qaeda\u2019s resurgence and the sectarian violence that has engulfed the country.\u201d\n\nThe excerpt concludes: \u201cIn my view, the ISIS offensive in 2014 greatly increases the risk that Iraq will become Al Qaeda\u2019s next safe haven. That is exactly what it had in Afghanistan pre-9/11.

{"entityId": 661, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "President Barack Obama began 2014 vowing to act without Congress if need be to get things done. This week, the White House proudly heralded more than 80 executive actions taken during the year, some of biggest taking place after his party took a beating in the November midterms.\n\nHere\u2019s a sampling of the unilateral actions the White House boasted about, and a few that weren\u2019t mentioned:\n\n1. Immigration\n\nOn Nov. 20, Obama announced action that would shield about 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation by prioritizing deportations for people who committed crimes.\n\n\u201cThe historic actions the president took on immigration offer millions of undocumented immigrants a path out of the shadows while holding them accountable to undergo background checks and become taxpayers, all while doing everything we can to attract and keep the most talented high-skill workers to our shores from around the world,\u201d said a White House blog post this week by presidential assistants Jeffrey Zients and Cecelia Munoz.\n\n2. Climate Change\n\nWhile in China in November, Obama and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached what the leaders called a historic climate change deal. The United States set a goal of reducing carbon emissions by between 26 and 28 percent by 2025, which would be rolling back to 2005 levels. China said its CO2 emissions would peak in 2030.\n\nBut aside from the climate deal with China, Obama also took several other climate-related actions: In July, he announced executive actions to help state and local government prepare for climate change. In October, agencies released plans for cutting emissions and preparing for flooding and extreme weather. Obama also pledged $3 billion in U.S. funds to the United Nations-affiliated Climate Resiliency Fund to help cut emissions for the poorest countries. And in Februar, Obama ordered the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation to establish new fuel efficiency standards for large vehicles.\n\n\u201cTo combat climate change, the president took steps to improve fuel efficiency for heavy-and medium-duty vehicles, put in place a Clean Power Plan to substantially cut carbon pollution from power plants; took action to make substantial cuts to hydrofluorocarbons; and reached a historic agreement to cut greenhouse gas emissions with China, among many others,\u201d the White House said.\n\n3. Minimum Wage\n\nOn Feb. 12, Obama signed an executive order raising the minimum wage for federal employees and federal contract workers to $10.10 per hour. He wanted Congress to raise the wage to that level for the rest of the country. That never happened, but the White House believes it motivated action in other states.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama rallied support for raising the minimum wage, while signing an executive order to raise the minimum wage for workers on new federal contracts,\u201d the White House blog said. \u201cCities, states and businesses across the country responded to that call, taking action that will benefit 7 million Americans as of 2017. And workers on new or modified federal contracts will be paid at least $10.10 starting on New Year\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\n4. Police\n\nAfter the controversies in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City where unarmed black men died after altercations with police officers, Obama asked for a review of best practices police departments can take to rebuild trust in their communities. On Dec. 18, he signed an executive order to create the Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The task force is set to hold listening sessions around the country and issue a report in March.\n\n5. Guns\n\nEarly in the year, the Obama administration took action regarding mental illness and guns. The executive action came through regulations by the Department of Justice and Department of Health and Human Services. The DOJ clarified rules on who is prohibited from purchasing a gun under existing federal law, which the White House said had been ambiguous. HHS required states to submit more information on individuals through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which was previously withheld under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPPA, which protects medical privacy.\n\nObama also issued an executive order in early October to make it more difficult to fire employees of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, by allowing more ATF employees to be converted to career-employees classifications and eligible for civil service protections. The ATF, a scandal-plagued agency in recent years, is generally regarded as the least-favorite federal agency among gun owners.\n\nNone of Obama\u2019s gun-related executive actions were mentioned in the White House\u2019s year-end report.\n\n6. Pay Discrimination\n\nObama issued an executive order to prevent gender pay discrimination among federal contractors in April. Three months later, he signed another executive order to ban pay discrimination among federal contractors against anyone in the LGBT community.\n\n7. \u2018Promise Zones\u2019\n\nIn January, Obama established five \u201cpromise zones\u201d in the United States: economically depressed areas across the country where businesses locating or expanding would be eligible for federal economic development grants, loans and tax incentives. The first five locations were San Antonio, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Southeastern Kentucky and the Choctaw Nation in Oklahoma.\n\n8. Tax Inversion\n\nIn September, Obama took action against corporate \u201ctax inversions,\u201d the term used for when an American company merges with a smaller foreign company, locating the in the foreign country to avoid the higher U.S. corporate tax rates. The Treasury Department announced regulations to make inversion less attractive by banning some of the techniques firms used to avoid paying U.S. taxes, while also requiring that a company\u2019s U.S. owners own less than 80 percent of the newly merged company to get the tax benefits. The actions were announced less than a month after Burger King\u2019s move to buy a Canadian coffee company and relocate in order to pay the lower Canadian corporate taxes instead of U.S. taxes.\n\n9. Expanding Credit\n\nSix years after the mortgage crisis, the Obama administration has taken actions to make it easier to get a home loan. On May 30, the Department of Housing and Urban Development along with the Federal Housing Finance Agency announced plans to expand access to mortgage credit. Earlier this month, the administration introduced the Home Affordability Modification Program, or HAMP, which includes $5,000 for an individual\u2019s foreclosure prevention.\n\n10. Green Industries\n\nIn September, Obama announced a series of government and private sector plans to buy more solar panels and promote the solar industry. In November, Obama announced commitments from 120 businesses, nonprofits and schools would buy electric vehicles and install workplace-charging stations.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:00:10.610+0000", "event": "articles"}

In this capacity, Bell sought to persuade national politicians to reinstate the gold standard \u2013 not just audit the Fed, which Bell views as a relatively empty and largely symbolic measure.\n\nBut as the Republican nominee told us in a recent interview in TheBlaze\u2019s New York offices, which you can listen to in full below, Bell could not compel others in Washington to take up the issue in a meaningful way:\n\nI spent four years in Washington as Policy Director of the American Principles Project trying to get people to deal with the need for monetary reform, specifically a return to the gold-backed dollar that we abandoned 43 years ago. And I couldn\u2019t do it. The Fed is an 800-pound gorilla. Nobody wanted to take them on. The Fed is financing Congress\u2019s increasing debt loads, which makes [federal spending] much less painful than it would otherwise be. They\u2019re financing\u2026a Wall Street boom. \u2026I couldn\u2019t find people who wanted to take the issue [of reinstating the gold standard] on. I even tried to recruit other candidates for the Senate\u2026but I failed\u2026So rather suddenly, in late January, I realized this issue wasn\u2019t going to get into the mix unless I returned to New Jersey and ran myself.\n\nAnd run Bell did, winning in a four-way Republican primary this past June, some thirty-six years after last winning an election.\n\nNow the conservative Bell finds himself in the midst of a most unconventional campaign (from the lobby of a New Jersey hotel), on a shoestring budget (his campaign reported $0 in the bank at last disclosure), primarily by championing a single issue (the gold standard).\n\nOn this latter point, Bell told us that given the nature of the campaign and financial limitations, rather than run on a broad array of issues he decided to run on \u201cthe thing that I think is most important for the economy, which is the mismanagement of monetary policy by the Federal Reserve, and the fact that they are almost singlehandedly holding back this economic recovery.\n\n\u201cTheir crushing low-interest rate policy makes it impossible or very difficult for even a successful small business to get lines of credit that they need to expand\u2026and of course savers cannot save by\u2026traditional means such as a savings account and CDs,\u201d he added.\n\nTheBlaze asked Bell if sound money was a compelling issue to New Jersey voters, especially in light of the fact that some Garden State natives work on Wall Street, and thus ostensibly benefit from the Federal Reserve\u2019s policies. While Bell acknowledges that this segment of the electorate is not particularly receptive to his views on monetary policy, he is not overly concerned with New Jersey\u2019s Wall Street denizens, focusing his efforts instead on grassroots voters:\n\nAlthough nobody was talking about the gold standard when I came into the state, if you offer it as the explanation and the answer for what is going on with the Fed \u2013 and their printing of money and their crushing the economy \u2013 then people are very interested\u2026and the fact that they haven\u2019t heard it before is not a negative because voters at the grassroots are much more open to ideas that are outside the box than elites are.\n\n\u201c[T]he grassroots are much more open to ideas that are outside the box than elites are.\u201d Share:\n\nA quick glance at Bell\u2019s website, not to mention his aforementioned book, \u201cThe Case for Polarized Politics: Why America Needs Social Conservatism,\u201d indicates the nominee\u2019s conservatism goes beyond monetary matters. When we asked him if such views were acceptable in a liberal state like New Jersey, Bell said that while the state is no Texas, he\u2019s \u201cgotten no pushback on\u2026[his] unapologetic support for life and the traditional definition of marriage.\u201d\n\nSkeptics would question Bell\u2019s viability as a candidate on the basis of his ideology alone. Running in a deep blue state like New Jersey \u2014 where Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney 58% to 41% in 2012 \u2014 is daunting for any Republican. But Bell notes that a national anti-incumbent theme, as reflected by Dave Brat\u2019s upset of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor on the right, and Marine Corps veteran Seth Moulton\u2019s victory over 9-term incumbent Massachusetts Democrat John Tierney on the left, may help him overcome the state\u2019s liberalism.\n\nIndeed an anti-incumbency atmosphere, combined with President Obama\u2019s sinking popularity in the state, and what Bell perceives as New Jersey\u2019s yearning for an outsider, is what leads him to believe that he has a legitimate chance to upset Democratic darling Cory Booker [link ours]:\n\nI\u2019m not at all concerned with the perception that New Jersey is a blue state\u2026New Jersey has had a sea change in its attitude towards President Obama in the last few months. He won the state with 15 percent of the vote\u2026in 2012. And yet a poll that just came out\u2026lists him as having a positive rating in the mid-30s [percent]\u2026after he got 58% two years ago. I think what\u2019s happened across the state is that voters have decided about this presidency, it is not working, and it is not going to work\u2026the world is falling apart and the administration seems to be a spectator. And they\u2019re not going to do anything different on the economy\u2026I think the last thing a lot of voters in New Jersey want to be doing is\u2026casting a vote that would be interpreted as a vote for the \u201cstatus quo.\u201d That\u2019s hurting Cory Booker.\n\nIn addition to the fact that New Jersey last elected a Republican senator in 1972, Bell\u2019s odds are further weakened due to Cory Booker\u2019s name recognition and comparably massive war chest. But Bell sees optimism in the fact that he is polling closer to Booker, further out from the general election than conservative candidate Steve Lonegan was in the run-up to the 2013 special election for the seat vacated by deceased Senator Frank Lautenberg, which Booker is now defending.\n\n\u201c[T]he world is falling apart and the administration seems to be a spectator\u201d Share:\n\nBell adds that Lonegan, who lost by approximately 11% to Booker, was gaining ground on the former Newark mayor before the U.S. government shutdown, which coincided with the final two weeks of the election, at which point Lonegan\u2019s rise halted.\n\nAs for how New Jersey voters see it, the closest poll conducted thus far, released in early August, had Bell running 10 points behind the incumbent senator, a lead that the New Jersey Star Ledger described as \u201crelatively modest,\u201d and which the assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll called \u201ca bit of a puzzlement.\u201d\n\nMore recent polls have shown a slightly larger anticipated margin of victory by Booker. Perhaps two of the more telling data points beyond their head-to-head numbers are that according to one poll, 46% of independent voters say they are unsure who they will support in the race, and according to another, 37% of all voters do not know who Jeff Bell is.\n\nExposure, then, remains a big issue for Bell. While Politico notes that prominent Republicans such as Steve Forbes, Bill Kristol and Larry Kudlow have worked for Bell, local reports indicate that the candidate has received tepid support from establishment New Jersey Republicans like Gov. Christie, or national groups like the Club for Growth or Senate Conservatives Fund.\n\nBell shrugged this notion off at least at the state level, noting that the New Jersey Republican Party has unified, evidenced for example by an upcoming fundraiser headlined by Christie. The New Jersey governor, for his part, has \u201cgrown weary\u201d of the implication he is not supporting the state\u2019s Republican party.\n\nWhile acknowledging the many difficulties facing his campaign, Bell remains optimistic, noting that pundits were not giving the candidate a shot several months ago, while all across the state Bell is hearing today that this is a winnable election.\n\nFurther, Bell reiterates that\n\nvoters are looking for somebody who is anti-establishment, outside the box\u2026the mood is anti-incumbent and anti-establishment, and Senator Booker would not have run up and down the state in his three stops of his campaign kickoff attacking me at every stop, unless his internal polls were consistent with the public polls that show this is a viable race for me.\n\nIf his analysis is right, Bell\u2019s narrative as an anti-establishment, populist conservative would appear to set up nicely against Booker. The incumbent \u2014 who played football at Stanford, earned a Rhodes Scholarship at Oxford and received a law degree from Yale before jumping into Newark politics \u2014 has notably spent his abbreviated U.S. Senate term attempting to take selfies with all 99 other senators, while amassing a political fortune by courting Silicon Valley and Wall Street. Booker also personally profited from his relationship with the tech community, drawing ire from progressives for a seeming lack of purity based upon such alliances.\n\nShould the voters dig into Booker, he also has a far larger public record than Bell, with significant questions about the veracity of the stories he has used to craft his image among voters, and perhaps more importantly the major problems that continue to face the city he led, Newark. One such scandal that occurred during Booker\u2019s tenure as mayor, under his oversight, involved the agency responsible for providing all of Newark\u2019s water allegedly \u201cfleec[ing] millions from the public fisc while his [Booker's] political allies enriched themselves.\u201d\n\nBooker\u2019s campaign for its part has attacked Bell as a Washington D.C. insider for his years spent in policy advocacy, and cast him as a carpetbagger since Bell moved back to New Jersey in February 2014, having spent the last several decades in the Beltway area.\n\nWhether or not the confluence of factors outlined herein will make the New Jersey U.S. senatorial race a competitive one in 2014 remains to be seen.\n\nBut while characterizations of Bell by ideological allies as \u201cthe most interesting candidate in the world\u201d may be going a bit far, Bell is undoubtedly a subversive candidate to the degree to which a genuinely radical monetary stance combined with traditional conservative values in a plain-spoken and humble package represents a break from the status quo.\n\nA vote for Bell may be perceived as a protest vote, as he acknowledged in our interview, irrespective of the results on election day. But if Bell can remain competitive with Booker to the end, he has a chance to make the reinstatement of sound money a relevant issue with the megaphone that is the nation\u2019s biggest media market. In that respect, for those who believe in the efficacy of a strong dollar, limited Federal Reserve, less spending and reduced federal debt, Bell is as good as gold.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Ben Weingarten (@bhweingarten) and TheBlazeBooks on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nYou can find all of our Blaze Books interviews on Soundcloud and Stitcher, and subscribe to our podcast automatically via iTunes.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:00:17.085+0000", "event": "articles"}

Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), the ranking member of the House Budget Committee, pressed the White House to drop the idea, the Associated Press reported.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) also demanded the administration drop the plan.\n\n\u201cFive twenty-nine plans help middle class families save for college,\u201d Boehner said earlier Tuesday, before the White House announcement. \u201cBut now the president wants to tax those plans. It\u2019s another example of this outdated, top-down approach when our focus ought to be on providing opportunity for all Americans. So for the sake of middle class families, the president ought to withdraw this tax increase from his budget when he submits it soon.\u201d\n\nThe plan would have cut tax benefits for future contributions to 529 college saving plans, but existing 529 accounts would have been grandfathered in and would not face the same penalty.\n\nThe administration wanted to use the estimated $50 billion in revenue from taxing the 529 saving to make the $2,500 education tax credit for families permanent. The credit is set to expire in 2017.\n\nSeparately, Obama also proposed making the first two years of community college free during the speech, a proposal that Obama and White House officials have talked far more about before and after the State of the Union.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:00:28.524+0000", "event": "articles"}
{"entityId": 676, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) \u2014 Republican Dan Sullivan won Alaska\u2019s U.S. Senate race, defeating incumbent Democrat Mark Begich.\n\nSullivan led Begich by about 8,100 votes on Election Night last week, and when state officials counted absentee and questioned ballots Tuesday, the results indicated that Begich could not overcome Sullivan\u2019s lead.\n\nThe Alaska seat was initially considered key to the Republicans\u2019 hopes of taking control of the U.S. Senate, but that was accomplished election night with the GOP sweep.\n\nSullivan, a first-time candidate, ran a confident campaign, ignoring the debate schedule Begich released during the primary and setting his own agenda. He also attracted some star power to the state, with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a tea party favorite, and 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney rallying support for Sullivan in the waning days of the hotly contested race.\n\nSullivan pledged to fight federal overreach, talked about the need for an energy renaissance in the U.S. and at seemingly every opportunity, sought to tie Begich to President Barack Obama and Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who are unpopular in Alaska.\n\nBegich complained that Sullivan offered little in the way of proposals for what he would do as senator. Begich also tried to paint sharp contrasts between himself and Sullivan in areas such as women\u2019s health, education and Alaska issues.\n\nBegich, for example, was born and raised in Alaska. He cast Sullivan, who grew up in Ohio, as an outsider, and many of the early attacks by pro-Begich groups keyed in to that theme. That perception of Sullivan made for an at-times uncomfortable debate on fisheries issues, in which questioners grilled Sullivan about his knowledge of one of Alaska\u2019s most important industries.\n\nOn several occasions, Sullivan\u2019s wife, Julie Fate Sullivan, an Alaska Native and frequent companion on the campaign trail, appeared in ads defending her husband\u2019s ties to the state and his positions on women\u2019s issues.\n\nSullivan has roots in Alaska dating to the 1990s but was gone for nearly seven years for military service and work in Washington, D.C., that included working as an assistant secretary of state. He returned to Alaska in 2009, when he was appointed attorney general by then-Gov. Sarah Palin.\n\nHe most recently served as Alaska\u2019s natural resources commissioner, a post he left in September 2013, to make his first run for public office.\n\nSullivan hit the ground running, exhibiting a fundraising prowess that rivaled and during some quarters exceeded that of Begich. Many of his supporters cited his service in the Marine Corps reserves or repeated the oft-repeated GOP refrain that became of hallmark of the campaign \u2014 that Begich voted with Obama \u201c97 percent of the time,\u201d a figure that takes into account votes during 2013, many of them on confirmations, on which Obama stated a preference.\n\nHe said he was humbled by the support he received and publicly sought to tamp down expectations, even as campaign members expressed great confidence in a victory in the lead-up to Tuesday and said the Democrats\u2019 much-talked-about ground game wasn\u2019t all it was made out to be.\n\nTens of millions of dollars were pumped into the state, with Republicans seeing Begich as vulnerable and Democrats trying to hold the seat Begich won in 2008. Voters were barraged by calls and ads, which many said they were turned off by.\n\nSullivan emerged from a hard-fought, three-way GOP primary to take on Begich, who had token opposition. Begich focused during that race on bolstering his homespun image, casting himself as an independent thinker unafraid to stand up to Obama, with a record of working across party lines, including with Alaska\u2019s senior senator, Republican Lisa Murkowski. Murkowski, who backed Sullivan after the primary and is in line to chair the Senate energy committee now that Republicans have taken over the Senate, told Begich to knock it off.\n\nA turning point, in the view of many observers, was an ad from Begich\u2019s campaign shortly after the primary that painted Sullivan as soft on crime. It featured a man identified as a former Anchorage police officer standing outside the home where an elderly couple was beaten to death and a family member sexually abused in 2013. It ended with the man saying Sullivan should not be a senator.\n\nThe ad, which Sullivan responded to with one of his own, was pulled following a demand from an attorney for the victims\u2019 family.\n\nBegich, in discussing the ad, said Sullivan had a \u201cpattern when he was attorney general of doing these plea deals that let violent offenders, sexual offenders out earlier than they should be.\u201d He said Sullivan\u2019s record as attorney general needed to be scrutinized. But that didn\u2019t become a major focus of TV ads by his campaign and surrogates.\n\nInstead, some of the strongest criticism of Sullivan was with regards to his residency, his support of a permitting bill that critics said would have limited public participation in the state\u2019s permitting process and his stance on abortion.\n\n\u2014", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:00:30.293+0000", "event": "articles"}

In 2006, Barry was given three years of probation after pleading guilty to misdemeanor charges for failing to file tax returns from 1999 to 2004. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to file future federal and local tax returns annually, a promise prosecutors later said he had failed to keep. In 2010, he was censured by the council and stripped of his committee assignments for steering a government contract to a former girlfriend. The council levied a similar punishment in 2013 after he admitted accepting cash gifts from city contractors.\n\nStill Obama lauded Barry for advancing the cause of civil rights as a one-time leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee.

Mike Huckabee will be entering a very different Republican primary field when he announces his candidacy Tuesday, one that will likely bring up the debate over where libertarians stand in the Republican party, while also facing more competition for social conservative voters than eight years ago.\n\n\u201cHuckabee does have name recognition having been on Fox News all this time,\u201d Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, told TheBlaze. \u201cAt the same time, after he won the caucuses here in 2008, there was a lot of concern that he wasn\u2019t as conservative as some thought.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Huckabee is returning to his hometown of Hope, Arkansas to announce he is running again for president. Huckabee won the Iowa caucus in 2008 and seven other states that year, but failed to capture the Republican party\u2019s nomination.\n\nOne major candidate he\u2019ll be facing in the primary is Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, carrying the libertarian banner. In May 2008, after exiting the race, Huckabee delivered a broadside to libertarianism, calling it the \u201cgreatest threat to classic Republicanism.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a heartless, callous, soulless type of economic conservatism because it says, \u201clook, we want to cut taxes and eliminate government. If it means that elderly people don\u2019t get their Medicare drugs, so be it. If it means little kids go without education and healthcare, so be it,\u2019\u201d Huckabee said of libertarianism.\n\nThat old debate will definitely be prominent in the campaign, said Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, a social conservative think tank.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that it will be a central underlying debate in this campaign,\u201d Perkins told TheBlaze. \u201cThe libertarian viewpoint has gained some ground, but its setbacks have been significant. Rand Paul, the leader of that view, has advocated isolationism. We know that will not work and might make things worse in the world. The evidence is overwhelming against pure libertarianism.\u201d\n\nWinning over social conservatives will be a bigger problems this time, because that base has more choices than in 2008.\n\n\u201cAs a person who won the caucus, he came from behind with social conservatives,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cIn 2012, Rick Santorum came from behind to win with many of the same voters. His problem this year is that Santorum is running again. Ted Cruz is running. There is going to be more competition for those socially conservative voters. Eight years is a different world.\u201d\n\nIowa is an important state for Huckabee having won it eight years ago. It will reflect poorly on either Huckabee or Santorum to lose a state they previously won, Hagle said.\n\nThe importance of a past winner winning Iowa varies, as there are two precedents.\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush beat Ronald Reagan in the 1980 Iowa Caucus, but as a sitting vice president came in third place in the 1988 Iowa contest. He still managed to capture the Republican nomination the presidency. On the flip side, Missouri U.S. Rep. Richard Gephardt won the 1988 Democratic Iowa Caucus, but his loss in the 2004 caucus ended his campaign.\n\nThough he is entering a very different field, Huckabee is still a popular political figure whose time hasn\u2019t passed, Perkins said, and he has had time to prove his conservatism.\n\n\u201cIn the last seven years he has articulated on Fox News and in speeches across the country a very conservative agenda,\u201d Perkins said. \u201cIn 2008 there were tax issue as governor where he had to work with a Democratic legislature.

So you\u2019ve got a 15 percent flat tax there, right? \u2026 [Why not] one 15 percent, and one 25 percent?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat would be one approach. But as we have run the numbers, we think it is the best way of making it work in a way that doesn\u2019t add unduly to our deficit,\u201d Lee said. \u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day; we are open to all kinds of suggestions. We are open to considering something like that. We weren\u2019t able to make the numbers work the first round when we put it together. But this is still a big tax cut. This is still a $1 trillion tax cut, and that\u2019s putting it conservatively. \u2026 This is a very aggressive tax cut, a Reagan-esque type of tax cut.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are so good with the law. How good were you at math?\u201d Beck said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t see this the same way. \u2026 You said, \u2018We can\u2019t get there from here.\u2019 And I understand. I really do understand you can\u2019t change a tire going 150 miles per hour. But Woodrow Wilson, FDR, Johnson, Barack Obama, they all gave us the biggest tire changes at 150 miles per hour this country has ever seen. On our side, on the conservative side, we had Abraham Lincoln and Ronald Regan. That\u2019s it. I\u2019m sorry, and Calvin Coolidge.

If the Soviet Union can figure this out, we can do it,\u2019\u201d Beck continued heatedly. \u201cI don\u2019t remember the number, and I\u2019m sure you know it, like 17.9 or 18 percent, that no matter what you do to the rates, you always collect about that much. Why aren\u2019t we just targeting that number?\u201d\n\nLee agreed and said \u201con average we are able to collect about 18 percent of GDP through our income tax system \u2026 regardless of how high you set the top marginal rate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut again, what we are looking at here is the biggest simplification we can get \u2014 \u201d Lee began.\n\n\u201cMike, you know I love you, right?\u201d Beck interrupted. \u201cI respect you.

Jerry Brown to veto a gun control bill \u2014 but it\u2019s one that might garner some special attention, because its members agree with the Democrat on most other matters.\n\nIn a letter to Brown, Liberal Gun Owners Association President Eric Wooten called the legislation that passed the state\u2019s legislature \u201cunconstitutional, unaffordable, unproven and unworkable.\u201d\n\nThe association is the lobbying arm of the Liberal Gun Club, based in the Oakland area, a kind of liberal version of the National Rifle Association. The organization describes itself as \u201ca California nonprofit advocating for the rights of gun owners, from a leftist perspective.\u201d\n\nThe legislation, Assembly Bill 1014, would allow a family members, law enforcement officials or medical professionals to seek a restraining order against an individual perceived to be a danger, preventing them from legally obtaining a firearm for 21 days.\n\nWooten\u2019s letter states: \u201cI firmly believe if you consider the larger ramifications of AB 1014 you will veto this dangerous bill,\u201d and called the bill a \u201cgiant step backward for both civil liberties and mental-health policy. \u201d\n\nThe legislation was sparked by the mass shooting near the University of California, Santa Barbara campus, which killed three people and injured 13.\n\nWooten said the proposed law would not have prevented the deadly shooting\n\n\u201cThe proponents of AB 1014 will tell you that it is meant to stop another tragedy like the one that occurred in Isla Vista, but half of those murder victims didn\u2019t die from gunfire,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cThe only thing that would have stopped that event from happening was for a troubled young man to get the treatment he so obviously needed long before he committed those murders.\u201d\n\nHe said the legislation \u201cprovides an enormous disincentive for gun owners (or those merely considering gun ownership) to seek professional or familial help by criminalizing mental and substance-abuse problems, thereby pushing further into darkness those who need help the most.\u201d\n\nHe said the California proposal was based on a Connecticut state law that was in place before the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in late 2012 that killed 20 children.\n\n\u201cMaybe that law didn\u2019t cause the Lanzas to become the isolated household of gun owners they were, but it certainly didn\u2019t get them the help they so obviously needed,\u201d Wooten said. \u201cIt also failed to take guns out of the hands of a dangerous individual.\u201d\n\nAnd from a fiscal standpoint, he added, court budgets are already strained because of heavy caseloads.\n\n\u201cDespite recent funding improvements, domestic-violence cases and restraining orders are still suffering because of an overworked court system,\u201d he said. \u201cLong lines, court employees unable to help victims complete complicated forms, processing delays and elimination of court reporters have all adversely affected these cases.

{"entityId": 725, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "TheBlaze posted a story earlier this week about a speech Republican Sen. Ted Cruz gave at a Middle Eastern Christians event in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe crowd seemingly started to turn on Cruz when he suggested that \u201cChristians have no greater ally than Israel.\u201d Individuals in the crowd reportedly started booing and shouting, \u201cstop it.\u201d\n\nHe ended by saying \u201cIf you will not stand with Israel and the Jews, then I will not stand with you,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cGood night, and God bless.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what some readers of TheBlaze had to say about Cruz\u2019s speech:\n\nmaryann72961\n\nFor the first time in a long time, I am proud of a leader standing up and saying what he believes, despite being booed. You go Ted Cruz. If you run for president in 2016 you will have my vote. God bless you.\n\nTROONORTH\n\nYou have to give Cruz credit for entering the lion\u2019s den and telling them what they needed to hear. A brave and principled man indeed.\n\nLogCabinRepublican\n\nWhat\u2019s right isn\u2019t always popular, and what\u2019s popular isn\u2019t always right. I stand proudly with Israel and Ted Cruz.\n\nRAMJR\n\nSALT HURTS! We are going to see fake Christians exposed. This is going to be the normality, and God is a part of the eyes that are opened, and ears that hear through the many lies and liars from pulpits across the country.\n\nTed Cruz is taking that stand, and many will see just how broken our churches are. Believe it or not, this is a good thing. It means that revival is happening. We have to turn back to God, though the hearts of human knowledge will not understand the heart God says we have to have.\n\nWe need to pray for God to keep a hedge of protection on the voices that call out that which is not of God\u2026even if they have the word \u2018Christian\u2019 in them.\n\n\u201cHe who has ears let him hear.\u201d\n\nGod bless.\n\nIconodule\n\nTo people saying these are fake Christians, be careful. Them not agreeing with what\u2019s essentially the idolatrous worship of the state of Israel in some Christian groups in America does not make them non-Christian. What makes them Christian is their faith in Christ, not the Jewish state of Israel. Christians from the Middle East, like most Christians throughout history and throughout the world, do not hold to the idea that the state of Israel is in fulfillment of biblical prophecy or that we need to support Israel to be Christians. This is a uniquely American theological movement and belief system that almost thinks of Judaism as a legitimate religion.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t excuse their booing of Ted Cruz, and I do think he is right: Israel should be the best ally for Christians of the Middle East. I look at the Islamic states and compare that to the Jewish state and it\u2019s clear that Israel is a better country. But Middle Eastern Christians \u2014 Christian Palestinians in particular \u2014 are unwilling to believe in the modern American doctrine of not criticizing Israel or not thinking it perfect.\n\nLarry\n\nI have a question, a real honest question. I\u2019m not trying to start a fight here, I really want to understand this whole thing. What has Israel done for the U.S.? I have heard and read some things that I did not believe at first, so I researched and found they were true. The government of Israel has spied on the U.S. and has attacked and sank a U.S. Naval vessel. Americans died in that attack. The government of Israel has been caught selling confidential military technology to our enemies. After all of this I still see what looks to me like blind obedience to a group of people that I am unconvinced are our friends at all. We pay for the entire nation of Israel. We arm them. I am half white and half native American. I say this because I\u2019m trying to make a point. I believe that God created all of us and that he loves all of us. I don\u2019t buy into that whole \u201cGod\u2019s chosen people\u201d thing. Do you think God would bomb Palestinians? When I hear Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Ted Cruz, they sound as though their first allegiance is to Israel. I believe Cruz will get the R nomination, because he supports Israel and because his wife is an employee of Goldman Sachs. And I have one last thing to say and I will stop for now: I have never understood how or why a person can disagree with something that the government of Israel does or has done and that person will almost always be labeled as being anti-semitic. That is wrong! Thank you.\n\nPeace2011\n\nThere is something fishy about this. I will say that a lot of Palestinian Christians are thought to hate Israel but not all fall for it. Certainly the majority of Christians in the Middle East do not hate Israel. Why would they? They can\u2019t support Hamas. If there is anything we know well, it\u2019s to NEVER trust a terrorist group like Hamas. I was born in Egypt and I am a Christian. I once defended Israel in front of my schoolmate in middle school and felt as though I was about to be ripped apart by everyone\u2019s looks \u2014 there were mainly Muslims around me. I am proud to be a Christian Egyptian and I am for Israel. I am for peace and I support Ted Cruz. I pray he becomes our next president.\n\nHugie 59 PA\n\nThey persecuted the Prophets of the Old Testament (Hebrew Scriptures) who were speaking truth to power and these so-called Christians are persecuting Sen. Cruz in the same manner. Remember, Jesus is a Jew and all but one of his Apostles (St. Luke) were Jews. The Jews are our elder brothers and sisters in the faith. What is wrong with this picture? The Left has smeared Israel and these Christians-in-name-only fools are listening to them by rejecting Israel. Current-day Judases. Israel has bent over backward for peace, granting land over and over again. But Hamas and every other Muslim organization or state wants the Democratic State of Israel destroyed. Then the Muslims can behead homosexuals, Christians, infidels, and establish their Caliphate and Sharia Law. Is that what you fools want?\n\natastic\n\nI have been wondering when this disconnect between Christian cultures was going to come to light. I am glad Ted Cruz has introduced the dialogue that Middle Eastern and Western Christians need to have. Declaring an ally does not have to be a proclamation of a particular brand of biblical faith or understanding, but the Middle East is hardwired to be divided into groups of distrust, and racial divide is expected. (The Nation of Islam is delusional if they think they would be met with open arms by their Arab or Persian brethren.) There is much deep, complex bitterness and animosity. A friend of mine who is older (in his 50s) grew up in Jerusalem as a Christian. He laments that the Christians in Jerusalem at the time were treated worse by Jews than the Muslims. It could be an Arab thing. I want to understand. Everybody wants to simplify this into two groups, into easy talking points. The Middle East has so many moving parts. The disconnect between Christians must be understood, discussed, and resolved, so that unity/strength can be found. A documentary on this topic could be a good idea.\n\nKNaggieland\n\nMaybe Ted Cruz should have done his homework and found out the relationship between these Christians and Israel?\n\nMany of them lived in places like the West Bank or Gaza, so when Israel pushed or made agreements and created predominantly Muslim populations in these areas it had a natural affect on the Christians already living there. Not mention most of the Christians in Israel are Arabs and ethnically tied to Palestinians.\n\nWhen Christ gave his message it may have been as a rabbi and a Jew, but it resonated with the downtrodden of the nation who were not Jews or were lower-class Jews. Not much has changed.\n\nwolfy ghalkhani\n\nHow did Israel get into this conversation? The whole venue was supposed to be about the Christian genocide taking place now. I like Cruz, but he\u2019s being naive about Jews. Jews don\u2019t love Christians. As a matter of fact, Jew Bolsheviks were behind the murders of over 20 million Christians in Russia less than 100 years ago, and their progeny are here in America turning the screws on us as I write. Jews never helped Christians \u2014 ever. So I understand the rage that the audience felt when Ted opened his mouth about the Jews. Yes, the Jews suffered, but Christians have suffered even more genocide (at the hands of the Muslims, Bolsheviks and slavery of which the Jews were middlemen). Cruz should not have been so bullheaded. If it had been me being booed, I would have stopped and asked what the problem was. That\u2019s what a man/woman of the people would have done.\n\nbobohack1\n\nThese so-called Christians seem to forget one thing; Jesus was a Jew! Jesus was not a Christian; the Christian sects were named after him. Jesus was a Jew. Only after his disciples began to preach his philosophy to the masses and many years later did the word Christian even come into being. Ironic as it may seem, without the Jews there would be no Christians, and those so-called Christians could not boo Ted Cruz for suggesting that they support the Jews as our ally.\n\nkevino545\n\nI know many Christians who are against Israel\u2019s handling of the conflict.\n\nYou can support a side\u2019s right to defend itself without supporting how it\u2019s defending itself.\n\nExample: If a guy is shooting at you from a school full of civilians, I can support you defending yourself from that guy; but I wouldn\u2019t support you bombing that school and everyone in it into rubble.\n\nTJM1791\n\nThe more I hear him talk, the more I grow to like him.

On Monday, a Washington Post fact-checker gave Clinton\u2019s false assertion \u201c4 Pinocchios.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s exactly what Clinton said in Vegas on May 5:\n\n\u201cIn New York, which I know a little bit about because I represented it for eight years and I live there now, our undocumented workers in New York pay more in taxes than some of the biggest corporations in New York.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post\u2019s Glenn Kessler took apart Clinton\u2019s remarks, ultimately labeling it a \u201cnonsense comparison\u201d and \u201cfairly misleading.\u201d Read some of Kessler\u2019s analysis below:\n\nEven if Clinton incorrectly stated her talking point, this is a tendentious argument that is probably made even less relevant by 2014 tax data. (Note how the taxes paid by Verizon and Citicorp increased as the economy began to pick up.) If she is only talking about state and local income taxes, that\u2019s just $186 million, according to the ITEP estimate for New York. Verizon and Citicorp still exceed that number on state and local taxes alone. Undocumented immigrants obviously pay a lot of taxes, especially sales taxes. Clinton would have an even stronger case to highlight the tax contribution of illegal immigrants if she mentioned that the Social Security actuary estimated that illegal immigrants paid $12 billion in Social Security taxes in 2010 alone, with little hope of ever receiving benefits. (They used false or duplicative Social Security numbers.) That\u2019s even more than the ITEP estimate for state/local income taxes, sales taxes and property taxes paid by illegal immigrants across the nation.

Trump has amassed 32.5 percent of the total share of voice \u2014 a summation of all mentions of a candidate across social media \u2014 for all candidates, as well as nearly half of the share of voice among Republicans at 46.6 percent.\n\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t surprised to see that Donald Trump was dominating the conversation.

Policy stories like immigration are in.\u201d\n\nBut despite dominating the conversation, Trump isn\u2019t faring well when it comes to \u201cturning talk to action,\u201d according to the PEORIA Project. His announcement tweet was only retweeted 11,000 times, compared to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s tweet, which garnered 13,000 retweets. In comparison, a tweet about climate change from former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton received 57,000 retweets.\n\nThe report even states that Sen.

Rand Paul, isn\u2019t surprised by Trump\u2019s lack of action. He told TheBlaze that when it comes to social media, there\u2019s a fine line between doing something for shock value and doing something that has a larger purpose.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s always a shock value of things online,\u201d Harris said. \u201cJust because things go viral, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a success in winning an election. It\u2019s about growing a grassroots base and it\u2019s about being presidential. Senator Paul uses social media in a way that\u2019s presidential.

He also has solid retweet numbers relative to his total number of mentions,\u201d the report states.\n\nThe report claimed that Cruz, who supported Trump, and Paul, who remained neutral on the candidate, have fare better for doing so.\n\nHarris said that while 2016 will be the first presidential election where digital media brings the majority of voters their news, the Paul campaign is remembering what\u2019s at the core of social media \u2014 the social component. And while Paul doesn\u2019t garner the most retweets (the PEORIA Project hands that achievement to Cruz), he is quite social online: crowdsourcing T-shirt ideas on Facebook and Twitter, becoming the first candidate to utilize livestreaming video apps Meerkat and Periscope, conducting a townhall on Facebook and sending Snapchats to his libertarian fan base.\n\nHarris also said that the campaign has purchased Snapchat ads in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina to target voters in those early states.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a better campaign on either side of the aisle that\u2019s using social media,\u201d Harris said. \u201cSenator Paul very much thinks that social media was very much a definer of President Obama\u2019s victory and he certainly wants to very innovative in its use.\u201d\n\nCarly Fiorina\u2019s campaign told TheBlaze they utilize Periscope as well to get the former Hewlett-Packard CEO\u2019s message out. Spokeswoman Anna Epstein said Fiorina\u2019s campaign also utilizes online collaborative blogging site Medium to spread the candidate\u2019s remarks.\n\nAccording to PEORIA, in the post-Trump social media era, while most of the conversation surrounding candidates have been negative, Fiorina and former neurosurgeon Dr. Ben Carson have had positive conversations. Only three Democrats have had positive conversations: Clinton, Sanders and Lincoln Chafee.\n\nBut all of the other social media platforms aside, it\u2019s Cruz and Clinton that are dominating the echo reach on social media, according to the PEORIA Project. Cornfield said Cruz was smart to announce way ahead of the other candidates as it\u2019s given him more social media time.\n\nHowever, when people on social media are only talking about Republican candidates, N.J. Gov. Chris Christie and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry dominate the conversation, according to the report.\n\nBut as Clinton\u2019s most retweeted tweet shows, it\u2019s not all about candidates\u2019 announcements on the social media platform. Cornfield told TheBlaze that one of the most astonishing things he noticed in the first report was that when he examined when people were talking the most about former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, it wasn\u2019t about his presidential announcement, but instead comments he had made months prior in regards to the controversy in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nData mining is something businesses and corporations have utilized for years, put applying that same technology to social media and elections is a project that Cornfield, an associate professor at GWU\u2019s Graduate School of Political Management, told TheBlaze has been on his mind for at least 10 years. And finally this year with the support he needed, as 22 presidential candidates are traveling the country in an attempt to woo voters, Cornfield and his partner are embedding themselves deep into the world of social media.\n\n\u201cI thought it would be a good idea to take that technology and apply that to politics \u2014 seeing how often presidential candidates\u2019 names are being mentioned in the news and social media, what the trends are, what the sentiment is and how they\u2019re doing relative to each other, which is crucial for politics,\u201d Cornfield said in an interview with TheBlaze.\n\nThe second report, however, only analyzes 20 candidates as John Kasich and Jim Gilmore announced their candidacies too late. The professors and Zignal Labs researched the social media patterns of this report from May 16 to July 19, 2015.\n\nAccording to Pete Eskew, head of East Coast operations for Zignal Labs, their firm tracks media stories in real time and shows how a tweet can take a story and make it travel. Eskew said Zignal Labs works with politicians and businesses alike \u2014 the firm figures out just what their client wants to find out and uses boolean logic to extract that data.\n\nMatthew Zito, vice president of social intelligence platform Synthesio, told the Washington Examiner that campaigns quickly and easily able to obtain information through data mining due in part to social media.\n\n\u201cIf you wanted to get 10,000 people\u2019s opinions you\u2019d have to do a poll, or survey, or an interest group, and that\u2019s a very time consuming process,\u201d Zito said. \u201dThe brilliant thing about social media is that people are actively giving their opinions not just on political topics, but on any topic you could possibly imagine.\u201d\n\nMany campaigns declined to comment to TheBlaze on their social media use. Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s campaign pointed TheBlaze to an interview the Florida Republican did at the Freedom Partners event in California on Sunday.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got to use however people are communicating,\u201d Rubio said when asked about his Snapchat. \u201cThat\u2019s the only way you\u2019re going to reach them today. And so we try to harness all of that.\u201d\n\nAnd as the data has shown Trump\u2019s ability to shine bright on social media \u2014 even taking some of the wind out of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush\u2019s sails on his announcement day \u2014 Cornfield warns candidates not to take the boisterous man too lightly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tempting to write off the Trump phenomenon as a summer craze,\u201d he said in the report. \u201cBut the conversation data and the wide open structure of the race suggest that he could be a factor right into the voting process.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:02:20.056+0000", "event": "articles"}

Still waiting on a response\u2026 http://t.co/TDBpdOanPl \u2014 Katherine Timpf (@KatTimpf) May 5, 2015\n\nThe open letter, written by National Review reporter Katherine Timpf, took issue with Clinton\u2019s announcement in a speech last week that it\u2019s \u201ctime to end the era of mass incarceration.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have some questions,\u201d Timpf said at the outset of her letter.\n\nTimpf wrote that she found Clinton\u2019s current position odd, given her previous record as first lady.\n\nNow, I do agree with that statement \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean to be all judgies or whatever \u2014 but I gotta say I was pretty surprised to hear it coming from you. After all, your record seems to suggest that you do think that locking people up is the answer. During your time as First Lady, while Bill was enacting policies that provided funding to build more prisons and pushed states to adopt harsher sentencing laws, you cheered him on. You made sure everyone knew that this \u201ctough on crime\u201d approach wasn\u2019t just your husband\u2019s \u2014 it was yours, too. During a speech in 1994, you said we need \u201cmore prisons\u201d (why would you want more if you thought they did \u201clittle to reduce crime\u201d?) and \u201cmore and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders\u201d (people like Freddie Gray, whose plight you now suddenly seem to sympathize with).\n\nTimpf then took aim at Clinton over recent accusations she wasn\u2019t transparent during her time as secretary of state.\n\nYou also talked about wanting body cameras for police to record their every move, for the sake of \u201ctransparency and accountability.\u201d I love this idea. Imagine being able to watch every single move that these officers make just to make sure that the people we trust with so much are serving us the way that they promised they would. Honestly, transparency sounds wonderful to me and to so many in my generation who are fed up with finding out that politician after politician has been lying to us and keeping secrets. I have to ask, though, if you want cops to turn over camera footage of every single moment of their shifts, why did you turn over only some of your e-mails from your time as secretary of state? What is the difference?\n\nSpeaking to TheBlaze Tuesday evening, Timpf said she has received a \u201cpretty positive response\u201d to her letter.\n\n\u201cA lot of people have the same questions as I do, but apparently she doesn\u2019t seem to think she has an obligation to answer questions or explain herself to anyone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cCriminal justice reform is no doubt a very important issue, and the current system has been devastating to a lot of people and their families,\u201d Timpf added to TheBlaze. \u201cGiven this, you\u2019d think Hillary would have the class to acknowledge that she was wrong to support the kinds of policies that contributed to the problem before blatantly exploiting the people they affected people for her own political gain.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:02:23.750+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 762, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama will call for increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans by raising the capital gains rate and eliminating a tax break on inheritances, then using the revenue to fund new tax credits and other cost-saving measures for the middle class.\n\nThe president\u2019s proposals are likely to be cheered by the Democratic Party\u2019s liberal base, but the tax increases are all but certain to be non-starters with the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill.\n\nObama will announce the tax proposals Tuesday night in his State of the Union address. Senior administration officials disclosed details Saturday on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the proposals by name ahead of the president.\n\nThe president\u2019s address \u2014 his first to a Republican-led Congress \u2014 will also include calls for lawmakers to make community college free for many students, increase paid leave for workers and enact broad cybersecurity rules.\n\nThe centerpiece of the president\u2019s tax proposal is an increase in the capital gains rate on couples making more than $500,000 per year to 28 percent, the same level as under President Ronald Reagan. The top capital gains rate has already been raised from 15 percent to 23.8 percent during Obama\u2019s presidency.\n\nObama also wants to close what the administration is calling the \u201cTrust Fund Loophole,\u201d a change that would require estates to pay capital gains taxes on securities at the time they\u2019re inherited. Officials said the overwhelming impact of the change would be on the top 1 percent of income earners.\n\nWhile GOP leaders have said they share Obama\u2019s desire to reform the nation\u2019s complicated tax code, the party has long been opposed to many of the proposals the president will outline Tuesday. For example, most Republicans want to lower or eliminate the capital gains tax and similarly want to end taxes on estates, not expand them.\n\nAdministration officials pointed to a third proposal from the president as one they hope Republicans would support: a fee on the roughly 100 U.S. financial firms with assets of more than $50 billion. Officials said the fee is similar to a proposal from former Republican Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, who led the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee. Camp\u2019s plan, however, was part of a larger proposal to lower the overall corporate income tax rate.\n\nRaising the capital gains rate, ending the inheritance loophole and tacking a fee on financial firms would generate $320 billion in revenue over a decade, according to administration estimates. Obama wants to put the bulk of that money into a series of measures aimed at helping middle-class Americans. Among them:\n\n\u2014A credit of up to $500 for families in which both spouses work. The administration says 24 million couples would benefit from the proposal, which would apply to families with annual income up to $210,000.\n\n\u2014Expanding the child care tax credit to up to $3,000 per child under age 5. The administration says the proposal would help more than 5 million families with the cost of child care.\n\n\u2014Overhauling the education tax system by consolidating six provisions into two, a move that could cut taxes for 8.5 million families. Republicans have been open to the idea of consolidating education tax breaks.\n\nObama\u2019s call for higher taxes on the wealthy could further antagonize Republicans who are already angry with the president over his vows to veto several of the party\u2019s priorities, including legislation to approve construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, make changes to the president\u2019s signature health care legislation and block his executive actions on immigration.\n\n\u201cThis can be the moment the president pivots to a positive posture.\u201d Share:\n\nRepublicans say Obama\u2019s veto threats are a sign of a president who didn\u2019t get the message from voters who relegated his party to minority status in the November election. New Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the president still has a chance to change his tone.\n\n\u201cTuesday can be a new day,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThis can be the moment the president pivots to a positive posture. This can be a day when he promotes serious realistic reforms that focus on economic growth and don\u2019t just spend more money we don\u2019t have. We\u2019re eager for him to do so.\u201d\n\nBeyond rolling out new proposals, Obama\u2019s address is also expected to focus on making the case to the public that recent economic gains represent a real and lasting recovery. The approach reflects the White House\u2019s belief that it has been too cautious in promoting economic gains out of fear of looking tone deaf to the continued struggles of many Americans.\n\nWhite House advisers have suggested that their restraint hindered Democrats in the November elections and helped Republicans take full control of Congress for the first time in eight years. But with hiring up and unemployment down, the president has been more assertive about the improving state of the economy in the new year. Tuesday\u2019s prime-time address will be his most high-profile platform for making that case.\n\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s resurgence is real, and we\u2019re better positioned than any country on Earth to succeed in the 21st century,\u201d Obama said Wednesday in Iowa, one of several trips he has made this month to preview the speech.\n\nObama isn\u2019t expected to make any major foreign policy announcements. He is likely to urge lawmakers to stop the pursuit of new penalties against Iran while the U.S. and others are in the midst of nuclear negotiations with Tehran. In a news conference Friday, Obama said legislation threatening additional penalties could upend the delicate diplomacy.\n\n\u201cCongress should be aware that if this diplomatic solution fails, then the risks and likelihood that this ends up being at some point a military confrontation is heightened \u2014 and Congress will have to own that as well,\u201d he said.\n\nThe president also is expected to cite his recent decision to normalize relations with Cuba, as well as defend the effectiveness of U.S. efforts to stop Russia\u2019s provocations in Ukraine and conduct air strikes against Islamic State fighters in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAssociated Press writers Stephen Ohlemacher and Laurie Kellman contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow Dave Urbanski (@DaveVUrbanski) on Twitter", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:02:42.619+0000", "event": "articles"}

Rand Paul looking likely to emerge as a top-tier candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. That\u2019s bringing to the forefront questions about whether religious conservatives who oppose abortion and gay marriage can co-exist with libertarians, many of whom hold more liberal social views and oppose the government regulating anything.\n\nConway will take part in a panel Saturday at the social conservative Values Voter Summit in Washington to make that exact case: \u201cMoral Decline Causes Big Government: Why Libertarians Should Joine the Pro-Family/Pro-Life Movement.\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth groups reject unelected judges upending voter will,\u201d Conway said. \u201cLibertarians may be less religious than values voters, but they share a growing distaste for the assault on religious liberty in so many corners of our culture.\u201d\n\nAs TheBlaze previously reported, libertarian groups, including the CATO Institute think tank, submitted legal briefs on behalf of Hobby Lobby in the company\u2019s successful lawsuit against the Obamacare mandate for employers to cover certain contraceptive drugs for their employees.\n\nDivisions between core conservatism and libertarianism can be traced back to the rift between William F. Buckley and Ayn Rand. But tensions seem to have cooled in recent years, chiefly because both camps found a common enemy with the increased growth of the federal government.\n\nA representative for former Republican presidential candidate Gary Bauer\u2019s American Values group, which is sponsoring the panel, believes that libertarians need to embrace social conservative policies to achieve their ends.\n\n\u201cAt the core of the challenge is that many libertarians don\u2019t believe they have a dog in the fight on issues like abortion, marriage and family values,\u201d the representative said. \u201cBut libertarians have virtually zero chance of achieving their primary goal of reducing the size of government if negative societal trends continue because the breakdown of the family has contributed to the massive growth of big government.\u201d\n\nThe other members of the panel are conservative commentator and author Maggie Gallagher, Doug Stafford, executive director of RANDPAC, and moderated by media consultant Kristi Hamrick.\n\n\u201cOur Founding Fathers gave us a system of limited government because they believed virtue and morality would restrain human passions. As Benjamin Franklin put it: \u2018Only a virtuous people are capable of freedom. As nations become corrupt and vicious, they have more need of masters.\u2019 Today we are seeing the confirmation of that wisdom,\u201d the Values Voter Summit schedule says in describing the forum.\n\n\u201cAs out-of-wedlock births increase, as marriage declines, as more children go to sleep at night in fatherless homes the demand for bigger government grows,\u201d the description continues. \u201cAs Judeo-Christian values decline, the heavy-hand of government fills the vacuum. If Libertarians want to achieve the goal of reducing the size and scope of government, they should join with social conservatives and support the pro-family agenda.\u201d\n\nConway cited the book by FreedomWorks head Matt Kibbe, \u201cDon\u2019t Hurt People and Don\u2019t Take Their Stuff: A Libertarian Manifesto,\u201d as a philosophy that could easily unite two factions.\n\n\u201cThere is more overlap than obstinacy, between the two groups really, but of course there will be disagreements,\u201d Conway said. \u201cMany libertarians are pro-life because they believe \u2018don\u2019t hurt people\u2019 extends to the womb. Libertarians abhor taxpayer-funding of abortion, and like, most of America, raise their eyebrows to stand against sex-selective, late-term and five month, 20 weeks or \u2018fetal pain\u2019 abortions.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul, like his father former Rep. Ron Paul \u2013 the 1988 Libertarian Party presidential nominee \u2013 is anti-abortion. The younger Paul has even sponsored sweeping pro-life legislation.\n\nBut Paul\u2019s problem might not be with social conservatives, said Steven Gross, a University of Kentucky political science professor.\n\n\u201cHe will not have a problem on social issues or abortion, he would not have gotten the nomination in Kentucky if he had not taken that position,\u201d Gross told TheBlaze. \u201cHis bigger problem will be in foreign affairs, not domestic.

The report said Democrats lack a \u201ccohesive narrative\u201d and recommended that the party find ways to help it explain bedrock values such as fairness, equality and opportunity.\n\n\u201cSo many people can rattle off easily and succinctly what it means to be a Republican. \u2026 The perception of what it means to be a Democrat has really evolved to be a laundry list of policy statements and disparate ideas,\u201d said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Florida congresswoman who leads the DNC.\n\nThe work of a 10-person task force comes after Democrats were clobbered in November, surrendering control of the Senate to Republicans and allowing the GOP to pad its majority in the House. Republicans captured governor\u2019s offices in Massachusetts, Maryland and Illinois \u2014 all safe Democratic states in presidential elections \u2014 and strengthened its grip on state legislatures.\n\nThe losses have led to soul-searching among Democrats as they try to translate success in presidential elections under Barack Obama into midterm elections dominated by congressional campaigns. Many party leaders contend that Democrats should have run more aggressively on Obama\u2019s record last year and drawn sharp distinctions with Republicans.\n\n\u201cWhenever we let the other guys talk the way they talk about our president, about our leadership, about our values, we\u2019re going to lose,\u201d said Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy told the DNC on Thursday. He said too many Democrats tried to be \u201cRepublicans lite.\u201d\n\nThe report recommends a multiyear effort to prepare for the next round of congressional redistricting after the 2020 elections, wary of Republican clout in statehouses that will determine the new boundaries for members of Congress following the next census.\n\nIt calls for more financial support and training for state parties in a return to the principles behind the \u201c50-state strategy\u201d promoted by former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, who led the DNC from 2005 to 2009. That approach aimed to compete in state and local elections throughout the country, even in states dominated by Republicans.\n\nThe final recommendation focuses on voting rights. It supports a constitutional amendment to enshrine the right to vote and attempts in Congress to restore portions of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court in 2013 removed from federal law an effective tool for fighting voting discrimination under the act and Democrats have tried to restore those protections.\n\nThe initial findings were based on hundreds of meetings with party leaders and members of Congress and included a survey completed by 10,000 Democratic activists, Wasserman Schultz said. A final report will come out in May.\n\nThe review offers parallels to a post-mortem by Republicans after the 2012 presidential election. That study urged the GOP to focus more on year-round, on-the-ground political organizing in states and recommended that Republicans embrace a comprehensive immigration overhaul, which has faced resistance by GOP members of Congress.\n\nThe DNC task force, which included Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear and Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, emphasize rebuilding the party\u2019s bench as Republicans aggressively recruit candidates for state and local office.\n\nIn one section of the report, the DNC panel notes that since 2008, Democrats have lost 69 House seats, 13 Senate seats, 910 state legislative seats, 30 state legislative chambers and 11 governors\u2019 offices.\n\n\u201cLook, I\u2019ll give the Republicans credit. They spent a lot of time and money working on this for years and it paid off for them,\u201d Wasserman Schultz said. \u201cWe\u2019ve certainly recognized that we have some catching up to do.\u201d\n\n___\n\nFollow Ken Thomas on Twitter: https://twitter.com/KThomasDC", "score": 3, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:02:50.479+0000", "event": "articles"}

When individuals get crowbars and start prying open doors to loot, they\u2019re not protesting, they\u2019re not making a statement \u2014 they\u2019re stealing,\u201d Obama said in his first public comments about the rioting and looting that swept the city. \u201dWhen they burn down a building, they\u2019re committing arson and they\u2019re destroying and undermining businesses and opportunities in their own communities that rob jobs and opportunity from people in that area.\u201d\n\nObama called the actions of the mayor of Baltimore and governor of Maryland, including calling up the National Guard to patrol the city streets, \u201centirely appropriate\u201d to \u201cstop that kind of senseless violence and destruction.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is not a protest, that is not a statement, it\u2019s people, a handful of people, taking advantage of a situation for their own advantage, and they need to be taken as criminals,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBut he said that since the events of Ferguson, Missouri, last summer, \u201cWe have seen too many instances of what appears to be police officers interacting with individuals, primarily African-American, often poor, in ways that raise troubling questions.\n\n\u201cIt comes up, it seems like, once a week, or once every couple of weeks. So I think it\u2019s pretty understandable why the leaders of civil rights organizations, but more importantly, moms and dads across the country would start saying this is a crisis,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cWhat I would says is, this has been a slow-rolling crisis that has been going on a long time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is not new. We shouldn\u2019t pretend that it\u2019s new. The good news is that perhaps there is some newfound awareness, because of social media and video cameras and so forth, that there are problems and challenges in terms of how our policing and laws are applied in certain communities. And we have to pay attention to it and respond.\u201d\n\nObama said there are police departments and communities around the country that have some soul-searching to do.\n\n\u201cI think we as a country have to do some soul-searching. This is not new,\u201d he repeated. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for decades and without making any excuses for criminal activities that take place in the communities, what we also know is that if you have impoverished communities, that have been stripped away of opportunity where children are born into abject poverty, they\u2019ve got parents often because of substance abuse problems or incarceration or lack of education themselves can\u2019t do right by their kids. If it\u2019s more likely that those kids end up in jail or dead than they go to college, communities where there are no fathers who can provide guidance to young men, communities that where there\u2019s no investment and manufacturing has been stripped away, and drugs have flooded the community and the drug industry ends up being the primary employer for a lot of folks\n\n\u201cIf we are serious about solving this problem, then we\u2019re going to not only have to help the police, we\u2019re going to have to think about what can we do, the rest of us to make sure that we\u2019re providing early education to the kids, to make sure that we\u2019re reforming our criminal justice system so it\u2019s not just a pipeline from schools to prisons, so that we\u2019re not rendering men in these communities unemployable because of a felony record for a nonviolent drug offense, that we\u2019re making investments so they can get the training they need to find jobs. That\u2019s hard. That requires more than just the occasional news report or task force,\u201d Obama said.\n\nNearly 200 people were arrested and more than 100 fires set, including to police cars and to buildings. Fifteen police officers were injured.\n\nThe unrest started hours after the funeral of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a spinal cord injury sustained while in police custody earlier this month.\n\n\u201cIf our society really wanted to solve the problem, it would require everybody saying this is important. That we don\u2019t only pay attention when a CVS burns, or a kid gets shot or gets his spine snapped,\u201d Obama said.\n\nFred Lucas contributed to this report.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:03:01.829+0000", "event": "articles"}
{"entityId": 776, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Appearing on Fox Business Network on Monday, Judge Andrew Napolitano, a prominent figure in the libertarian movement, noted two key issues that he feels Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is getting wrong. However, a spokesperson for the Cruz campaign told TheBlaze that it seems Napolitano misinterpreted some of the conservative lawmaker\u2019s positions.\n\nSpeaking on background, the Cruz spokesperson addressed both of Napolitano\u2019s grievances.\n\nNapolitano said his \u201cheart sank\u201d when Cruz spoke about a \u201cfederal right to education\u201d during his first campaign speech at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia, on Monday. Here\u2019s the exact wording from the transcript of Cruz\u2019s speech:\n\n\u201cImagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation, that every single child, regardless of race, regardless of ethnicity, regardless of wealth or ZIP Code, every child in America has the right to a quality education.\u201d\n\nThe campaign spokesperson told TheBlaze Cruz absolutely was not claiming that every person has a federally guaranteed right to education, and he never mentioned the federal government in making the point. Instead, the spokesperson said Cruz was advocating for \u201cbottom-up\u201d education reform centered around school choice, the \u201cright\u201d to choose.\n\nCruz has also been an outspoken critic of Common Core, the controversial national standards handed down to the states, and even asked his audience to \u201cimagine repealing every word of Common Core\u201d during his Liberty University speech.\n\nSecondly, Napolitano argued that he believes Cruz \u201cprobably would join all the other Republicans but Rand Paul with the idea that we should \u2014 to use Woodrow Wilson\u2019s phrase \u2014 make the world safe for democracy, which means perpetual death and perpetual war.\u201d Again, the spokesperson said the interpretation wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nThe campaign official directed TheBlaze to a Bloomberg View article titled, \u201cTed Cruz, Tea Party Hawk,\u201d as a resource to get an accurate representation of Cruz\u2019s view on foreign policy issues. You can read the portion of the article cited by the Cruz spokesperson below:\n\n\u201cThe central touchstone for U.S. foreign policy should be defending the vital national security interests of the United States,\u201d he said. He called weakness on that obligation \u201cthe most central failing\u201d of the foreign policies of President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In his brief Senate career, Cruz has sometimes sided with libertarians such as Paul on big national security issues, as when he opposed Obama\u2019s request for authorization to attack Syria after Bashar al-Assad\u2019s alleged use of chemical weapons (Obama later withdrew that request). But Cruz has also sided with the hawks in opposing Obama\u2019s nuclear negotiations with Iran and pushing for more sanctions on the Tehran regime. \u201cI believe both of those positions are consistent because both are driven by national security interests,\u201d Cruz told me. \u201cThere are a range of views within the Republican Party, but there is an overwhelming consensus that the Obama-Clinton foreign policy is a manifest disaster, that leading from behind does not work.\u201d [...] \u201cIt is inexplicable and indefensible that this president will almost never speak out for dissidents,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that shining light and speaking truth is soft power, it\u2019s often far more effective than dropping bombs.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, Napolitano said he mostly likes Cruz as a 2016 presidential candidate and suggested they are on friendly terms, a point that the Cruz spokesperson reiterated. But the libertarian thought leader made it clear that his number one choice for president is Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has yet to announce his candidacy for 2016.\n\n\u201cI basically do like him, I\u2019ve spent a lot of time with him, I know him very well,\u201d Napolitano said of Cruz on Monday. But he added, \u201cRand Paul is more faithful to the Constitution as I see it.\u201d\n\nWatch the original Fox Business Network segment from Monday afternoon here.\n\n\u2014", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:03:02.910+0000", "event": "articles"}

(AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama has argued for action on climate change as a matter of health, environmental protection and international obligation. On Wednesday, he added national security.\n\nThose who deny global warming are putting at risk the United States and the military sworn to defend it, he told cadets at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy. Failure to act would be \u201cdereliction of duty,\u201d their commander in chief said.\n\nHe said climate change and rising sea levels jeopardize the readiness of U.S. forces and threaten to aggravate social tensions and political instability around the globe.\n\nThe president\u2019s message to climate change skeptics was unequivocal: \u201cDenying it or refusing to deal with it undermines our national security\u201d\n\n\u201cMake no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country,\u201d Obama said on a crisp, sunny morning at Cadet Memorial Field. \u201cWe need to act and we need to act now.\u201d\n\nSeated before him were 218 white-uniformed graduates, pondering where military service will take them in life.\n\n\"Climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security\" \u2014@POTUS: http://t.co/K5YxkHO9qw #ActOnClimate pic.twitter.com/MoNg6jjbUW \u2014 The White House (@WhiteHouse) May 20, 2015\n\nObama drew a line from climate change to national security that had multiple strands:\n\n-increased risk of natural disasters resulting in humanitarian crises, with the potential to increase refugee flows and worsen conflicts over food and water.\n\n-aggravating conditions such as poverty, political instability and social tensions that can lead to terrorist activity and other violence.\n\n-new threats to the U.S. economy from rising oceans that threaten thousands of miles of highways, roads, railways and energy facilities.\n\n-new challenges for military bases and training areas from seas, drought and other conditions.\n\n\u201cAround Norfolk, high tides and storms increasingly flood parts of our Navy base and an air base,\u201d Obama said of military facilities in Virginia. \u201cIn Alaska, thawing permafrost is damaging military facilities. Out West, deeper droughts and longer wildfires could threaten training areas our troops depend on.\u201d\n\nPreparing for and adapting to climate change won\u2019t be enough, he said. \u201cThe only way the world is going to prevent the worst effects of climate change is to slow down the warming of the planet.\u201d\n\nHe laid out his administration\u2019s steps to reduce carbon greenhouse gas emissions, including strict limits on emissions from vehicles and power plants. The government expects those emission reductions to provide the U.S. contribution to a global climate treaty that world leaders are expected to finalize in December. Obama said it doesn\u2019t take a scientist to know that climate change is happening.\n\nThe evidence is \u201cindisputable,\u201d he said.\n\nWithout identifying the skeptics or those who resist action on climate change, Obama acknowledged the difficult terrain in Washington. \u201cThe politics will be tough, but there is no other way.\u201d He repeated: \u201cThis will be tough.\u201d\n\nObama\u2019s climate change agenda has drawn strong political opposition from the GOP-led Congress and faces a number of legal challenges. Many Republican lawmakers either have denied the science of climate change or have distanced themselves from it, saying they lack the expertise to issue an opinion.\n\nSome of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates have rejected unilateral moves to address the issue, saying it could hurt the U.S. economy.\n\nObama had a determined and hopeful response to all of that, but one not likely to be fulfilled: \u201cThis cannot be subject to the usual politics and the usual rhetoric.\u201d\n\nHis message was reinforced by Secretary of State John Kerry, just back from meetings in Asia. Kerry said in a statement that the idea of climate change as a national security issue \u201cwas a primary topic of discussion\u201d throughout his conversations with Asian leaders.\n\nRetired Rear Adm.

So we\u2019re going to call it America\u2019s College Promise. The concept is simple. America\u2019s College Promise will make two years of community college free to responsible students who are willing to work for [it].\u201d\n\nBut \u201cbuild on what works\u201d could be speaking too quickly: Tennessee Promise only takes effect for the state\u2019s 2015 high school graduates, so the state\u2019s program hasn\u2019t been fully vetted yet.

It should be a right for everyone,\u201d Obama said.\n\nBut the proposal is already facing congressional opposition.\n\nRep.

He forgot to mention the low-income families who rely on a Pell grant program that is on the path to bankruptcy. And the president forgot to mention those students and families facing higher college costs because many states are already stretched too thin.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama said his plan is modeled after Tennessee\u2019s plan, he isn\u2019t getting much support from its senators.\n\nSen.

I believe they do.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what some readers of TheBlaze had to say about the book passage:\n\nThe-Monk\n\nIt would have been better if GW Bush was invited, attended and spoke there.\n\nWhile Bush wasn\u2019t the best POTUS, he was far from the worst. He\u2019s an all-around nice guy to boot.\n\nOldOllie\n\nI think Bush proved he\u2019s a better man than McCain, and, apparently, a better pilot.\n\nmstang67\n\nA lot of people complain about how Bush did this and did that. Meeting the troops in hospitals or returning home, blah blah was an act. Well I don\u2019t give a damn even if it was an act, he showed them some friggin common courtesy, which is more than we can say for Obama. He\u2019s too busy bad mouthing our country and telling other world leaders how bad and sorry America is for living. God forbid he should visit some troops. He sure likes to ruin service member weddings for golf though. Bush wasn\u2019t perfect, but he at least acted like he loved America, and quite honestly I think he does. And I definitely believe that he cares for our armed forces and didn\u2019t take the deaths of service members lightly.\n\nJohnofOregon\n\nIf Bush were there, they would have had unity. That\u2019 something the McCain/Graham Republicrats do not want.\n\nHe was elected president twice. Both times defeating the \u201csmartest men\u201d in America.\n\nMutual respect is something Republicrats cannot do. Look at what the McCain team is doing to Paul. I am not a Paul supporter, but it is incredibly important for him to be involved since a majority of his supporters do not have Geritol prescriptions.\n\nRepublicrats only know how to lose. Mostly because the RINOs work for the other side\n\nangeleyes63\n\nI\u2019d trade for him on his worst day for the worst president in American history \u2014 who still resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nTexasKnight\n\nWhat most people from our side dislike about Bush is that he tried to get along with Democrats.\n\nHe actually listened to people who stole the \u201cW\u201ds off of government keyboards.\n\nThe left is so full of hate and yet he tried to work with them, yet they still hate him.\n\nImagine if he treated the other side the way the current resident in thief does.\n\nweathermanks\n\nI\u2019m a little surprised at the vitriol I\u2019m reading here. GW was not the perfect president by any means, and was not as conservative on some issues as he should have been, but he was barely in office nine months when he had an impossible burden thrust upon him, set up by Clinton. I was in the military on 9/11. Can you imagine if Obama had been President then? GW was the best one to be president at the time. And seeing how he has conducted himself after being out of office shows the true class act and gentlemen he is.\n\ngrannyjojo\n\nYou know President Bush wasn\u2019t perfect by ANY means but this I KNOW about him: He is a TRUE American, he had AMERICA\u2019s best interests in mind and did the VERY BEST he could. You put another Obama-like person up for election against Bush and I\u2019d vote for President Bush every single day. He is classy, his wife is classy and he believes in American exceptionalism. President Bush, THANK YOU SIR for being our President. God bless you and your family.\n\nmermaid7\n\nWhile he spent like a drunken sailor and pushed for the Patriot Act, he made both sides on the aisle mad. But at least he respected the office. He never dissed the American people on our soil or on foreign soil. He never told Democrats or people who disagreed with him politically to \u201cget in the back seat.\u201d He was always respectful of differing views. He never went against the Little Sisters of the Poor or got involved in cherry picking local cases with Beer Summits or equivocating anyone to be one of his children. His wife never uttered a single derogatory word about this nation and never took outlandish vacations. GW needed a teleprompter, too, but he didn\u2019t lie on a daily basis about shovel-ready jobs or that you can keep your doctor. He never shied away from calling Islamic terrorism what it was and certainly never blamed an attack on workplace violence or an obscure video. Like or not, you knew what you had and knew that he tried to protect this country. I like the well-known phrase, \u201cMiss me yet?\u201d Yes we do, Mr. President. Yes we do.\n\nPATRIOTMAMA\n\nThe McCain campaign was an exercise in failure and incompetence from beginning to end. They fed their greatest asset to the wolves and now we learn they insulted a two-term president. However much I disagree with a lot of what this president did, he should have been treated with respect by his own party. He has dignity and treated his office with respect and cared about his country and military. And at least he cared, and that makes him infinitely more respectable in my book than the current one or the one before him.\n\nOleDad48\n\nGeorge W was to the 2008 Republicans what Walter Mondale is to the Democrats. Even Jimmy Carter \u2014 admittedly the worst president in the last 100 years, second only to Barack Obama \u2014 has addressed the Democratic National Convention. It is sad to me, since he was a far better president than the liberal media depicts.\n\nHis response to 9/11 settled the nation and brought us together in response. Most of the Democrats who later condemned him, joined him in approving his war plans.\n\nBush sent more money to fight AIDS in Africa than any president before or since (but got no credit for doing so).\n\nHe immediately sent the Feds into New Orleans in the aftermath of Katrina, including thousands of trailers to provide temporary housing (trailers that later proved to be unhealthy and now sit in empty fields rotting). Despite immediate money and help, he received no credit. Rather, he was falsely accused of blowing up the levies in order to kill blacks so that Republicans would win the next election. (The insanity of the claim was not enough to overturn the hateful imagination of Farrakhan and others. Even the factual investigation of the outrageous claims \u2013 which revealed nothing \u2013 did nothing to assuage the passions of the race-baiters.)\n\nBush overturned Saddam Hussein and his butchery in Iraq, and through the surge, left office with a stable, democratically-elected government in Iraq.

Both believe that Jesus will return not as the Savior or Son of God but as a lieutenant to the Mahdi, and that he will force non-Muslims to convert or die. What\u2019s more, both believe that the Mahdi will come only when the world is engulfed in chaos and carnage. They openly vow not simply to attack but to annihilate the United States and Israel. Iran and ISIS are both eager to hasten the coming of the Mahdi. What\u2019s more, both believe that the Mahdi will come only when the world is engulfed in chaos and carnage. They openly vow not simply to attack but to annihilate the United States and Israel. Iran and ISIS are both eager to hasten the coming of the Mahdi.\n\nIt is a paradigm that Rosenberg said the U.S. ignores or fails to understand at its own peril.\n\n\u201cIf a policy maker or a presidential candidate doesn\u2019t understand \u2026 then they\u2019re not going to be prepared for the magnitude of genocide that\u2019s coming if these leaders can acquire the weapons they need,\u201d he told TheBlaze. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes this whole Iran nuclear deal issue so complicated.\u201d\n\nAs for President Barack Obama, Rosenberg said that the commander in chief clearly believes that Iran\u2019s leaders want a pathway back into \u201ccivilized international commerce and society,\u201d and that Obama presumably thinks that he can help them attain that.\n\nBut Rosenberg said that Iranian leaders have been calling for genocide, saying that he believes the regime is motivated by eschatology; Rosenberg also questioned why leaders like Obama would give Iran a \u201cpath that could lead to genocidal weaponry.\u201d\n\nRead Rosenberg\u2019s op-ed about the end times and the Mahdi here.\n\nAs TheBlaze previously reported, Rosenberg is hardly the first expert to warn about the Islamic State\u2019s end times theology, with others cautioning against underestimating and failing to understand the underlying constructs.\n\nPast reports have also claimed that Iran sees itself as having a central role in helping usher in the return of the Mahdi.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:03:52.333+0000", "event": "articles"}

Is. No. Excuse,\u201d Fiorina tweeted.\n\nTrump has contended that his statement to CNN that Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her \u2014 wherever\u201d was really in reference to her nose, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the outpouring of criticism. Erick Erickson, editor of RedState, even disinvited the candidate to the gathering over the weekend.\n\nSeven candidates rounded out the bottom of the poll, all with zero percent: New Jersey Governor Chris Christie with 51 votes, former Texas Governor Rick Perry with 45 votes, Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal with 32 votes, former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum with 16 votes, former Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore with 13 votes, former New York Governor George Pataki with 10 votes and South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham with eight votes.\n\nAccording to data provided to TheBlaze from Synthesio, a company that bills itself as the leading global social intelligence platform, Trump generated the most buzz online.

The White House isn\u2019t ruling out a unilateral act, invoking the phrase \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d to condemn companies that incorporate overseas.\n\nHowever, when pressed if there were any other unpatriotic tax deductions, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said, \u201cnot that I\u2019m aware of, but If you spot any, let me know.\u201d\n\nThe letter was signed by Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Jack Reed of Rhode Island.\n\nThe Democratic senators said in the letter Tuesday that they have introduced the Stop Corporate Inversions Act.\n\n\u201cHowever, our efforts should not preclude executive action to prevent corporate inversions. The coming flood of corporate inversions justifies immediate executive action,\u201d the letter said, according to Roll Call.\n\n\u201cThe coming flood of corporate inversions justifies immediate executive action,\u201d the letter says.\n\nCorporate inversion is when companies that primarily do business in the United States incorporate in another country to avoid the heavy U.S. corporate tax rates. Put another way, it\u2019s when a U.S. company with a foreign subsidiary becomes a foreign company with a U.S. subsidiary.\n\nEarnest didn\u2019t rule out unilateral action, but said congressional action is preferred.\n\n\u201cIf there is any sort of announcement we could make about steps the president could take unilaterally, we\u2019ll announce those at a later time,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cI\u2019m not in any position to make those announcements now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has talked a lot in recent weeks about economic patriotism,\u201d Earnest added. \u201cI think tactics like we\u2019ve seen here are a pretty good example of the need for us to consider the kind of economic patriotism that is good for the country and good for the businesses and workers located here.\u201d\n\nConservatives argue that the nation\u2019s high taxes on business push them overseas.\n\nAt 39.1 percent, the United States has the highest tax rate on business of any other developed country world. Most other developed countries have an average tax rate on businesses of 25 percent, according to Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group.\n\nEach of America\u2019s major trading partners \u2013 Canada, Mexico, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France \u2013 have lower corporate tax rates, according to ATR.\n\nEarnest also said Obama wants to close \u201cunfair loopholes\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve also noted that you could use some of that revenue that only benefits the wealthy and well-connected businesses in this country and invest it in the kinds of projects that benefit everybody, particularly modernizing our infrastructure,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why the president is calling on Congress to act on corporate tax reform.\u201d\n\nAnother reporter followed up by asking why it\u2019s fair to accuse the companies of being unpatriotic when they are taking legal deductions.\n\n\u201cWhat it means is that business that continues to be located in the United States that continues to to benefit from the infrastructure of the United States, that continues to benefit from the national security of the United States, that continues to benefit from the supply of workers from the United States, well educated, highly motivated workers in the United States, they benefit from all those things without paying their fair share in taxes,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cThe president believes that not only is not fair, it\u2019s not good for the American economy. It erodes the tax base.\u201d\n\nTreasury Secretary Jack Lew last month that he didn\u2019t think the president had the authority to act unilaterally, the New York Times reported.\n\nThe talk of unilateral action comes as the Republican-controlled House is suing Obama for overreach on executive actions, primarily as it pertains to Obamacare.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:04:09.843+0000", "event": "articles"}

Two days later, he attended a $32,400-per-person fundraiser in McLean, Virginia, to raise money for Democratic House candidates.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama\u2019s scheduled New Jersey and Connecticut trips were canceled because of the second health care worker diagnosed with Ebola inside the Dallas hospital that treated Thomas Eric Duncan, the first patient diagnosed with the virus in the U.S.\n\n\u201cThis indicates the seriousness of this situation, and the president believes it was important to convene the people responsible for coordinating this response,\u201d Earnest told reporters Wednesday. \u201cThat meeting was not possible while the president was traveling.\u201d\n\nObama attended fundraisers earlier this year after a plane was shot down over Ukraine, a second shooting at Fort Hood, and during the rise of the threat from the Islamic State terrorist group.\n\nAsked why Obama continued his political schedule in those cases but not Wednesday, Earnest said, \u201cWe consider these matters on a case-by-case basis.\u201d Asked whether canceling Wednesday\u2019s schedule was a political consideration, Earnest said, \u201cIt was not.\u201d\n\nIt took a second reported case on Wednesday of an American health worker contracting Ebola to prompt Obama to cancel a 5 p.m. fundraiser for Senate Democrats in Union, New Jersey, and an 8 p.m. speech for Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He instead scheduled a cabinet meeting for the afternoon.\n\nObama still has a scheduled fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Long Island, New York, Thursday. Earnest said he did not know if there would be a change to the Thursday\u2019s schedule.\n\n\u201cRepublicans portray him as not on top of foreign policy, not rolling his sleeves up in policy making, but the fundraiser in chief,\u201d Gary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, told TheBlaze. \u201cClearly it\u2019s an optics issue. But it has become what is defining his presidency. Ask people what they think of with President Obama and it\u2019s not hope and change anymore. It\u2019s fundraising for his party.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Obama has been doing official business this week, meeting with officials from the Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about Ebola on Monday. He met Tuesday with military commanders from 21 countries about dealing with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n\nIn August, Obama was criticized for hitting fundraising events after the Islamic State beheaded an American. He also took heat for attending a Democratic fundraising event in the immediate aftermath of the April shooting in Fort Hood. In July, Obama attended fundraising events after a Malaysian airliner was shot down over Ukraine that killed more than 250 passengers.\n\nObama had 15 scheduled fundraising events this month for the Democratic Party and Democratic candidates, according to the Sunlight Foundation, a government watchdog group. For 2014, Obama had 47 scheduled fundraisers.\n\nObama\u2019s second term fundraising has surpassed that of George W. Bush, but is behind Bill Clinton.\n\nFundraising events are always scheduled well in advance, so the big-dollar events are never planned to coincide with tragic events.\n\nBut fair or not, what the public has often seen \u2013 Wednesday being an exception \u2013 was Obama making politics a priority, Rose said.\n\n\u201cDoes he do more? Of course,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe don\u2019t always hear about that. In politics, perception is reality.\u201d\n\nRose said in a year when Obama hopes to defend the Democrats\u2019 Senate majority \u2013 which is key to his agenda \u2013 he might see no separation between politics and governing.\n\n\u201cThe Democratic party has a real chance of losing the U.S. Senate,\u201d Rose said. \u201cFundraising is critical to advertising and get out the vote efforts. On the other hand, all the public sees him doing is this.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:04:23.207+0000", "event": "articles"}
{"entityId": 821, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "President Barack Obama has once again invoked the Bible to defend his executive action on immigration. While TheBlaze already highlighted some of the potential problems with his latest claim that the holy book \u201csays don\u2019t throw stones in glass houses,\u201d there\u2019s something else worth noting.\n\nObama\u2019s recent use of the story about Mary and Joseph being turned away from the inn and believers being commanded not to mistreat foreigners \u2014 a concept in Deuteronomy 10:19 \u2014 to tout immigration reform appear to depart from thoughts he outlined in a faith-themed speech delivered eight years ago.\n\nIn that 2006 address at Sojourners\u2019 \u201cCall to Renewal\u201d conference, Obama spoke about religion and its role in public life, seemingly taking a different stance on allowing scripture to guide public policy: mainly, discouraging people from using Christian scripture to justify policy.\n\nWhile he made it clear in the address that he believes progressives are wrong to ask politicians to check their faith at the door, he also issued some challenges to conservative Christians, calling for universal values and messages that do not rely heavily upon a singular faith.\n\n\u201cWhat I am suggesting is this \u2014 secularists are wrong when they ask believers to leave their religion at the door before entering into the public square,\u201d he said. \u201cFrederick Douglas, Abraham Lincoln, Williams Jennings Bryant, Dorothy Day, Martin Luther King \u2014 indeed, the majority of great reformers in American history \u2014 were not only motivated by faith, but repeatedly used religious language to argue for their cause.\u201d\n\nObama went on to call on both progressives and conservatives to find common and universal ground when discussing contentious issues, noting that America is no longer \u201cjust a Christian nation.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s where his comments become interesting in light of his recent reliance on the Bible: even if America were still a Christian nation, Obama questioned which interpretation of scripture would be used to inform public policy.\n\n\u201cWhich passages of scripture should guide our public policy? Should we go with Leviticus, which suggests slavery is okay and that eating shellfish is abomination? How about Deuteronomy, which suggests stoning your child if he strays from the faith? Or should we just stick to the Sermon on the Mount \u2014 a passage that is so radical that it\u2019s doubtful that our own Defense Department would survive its application?\u201d he asked. \u201cSo before we get carried away, let\u2019s read our Bibles. Folks haven\u2019t been reading their Bibles.\u201d\n\nThe irony, in this case, is that the Old Testament scripture he decried for outlining the stoning of rebellious children (read here for one take on its actual context) is just chapters away from the verse that Obama has been using to tout immigration reform.\n\nObama went on in the 2006 speech to claim that democracy demands that those who are motivated by their faith \u201ctranslate their concerns into universal, rather than religion-specific values,\u201d speaking specifically about what politicians should do if they are attempting to pass laws.\n\n\u201cI may be opposed to abortion for religious reasons, but if I seek to pass a law banning the practice, I cannot simply point to the teachings of my church or evoke God\u2019s will,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths, including those with no faith at all.\u201d\n\nWatch the speech below:\n\nOne could argue that citing Judeo-Christian scripture to advocate for the implementation of public policy is a direct violation of the very tenets outlined in Obama\u2019s \u201cCall to Renewal\u201d speech.\n\nConsider the words he delivered last month while detailing his executive action on immigration.\n\n\u201cScripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger \u2013 we were strangers once, too,\u201d he said. \u201dMy fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too. And whether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship.\u201d\n\nWhile Obama certainly used some \u201cuniversal values\u201d here, there\u2019s also plenty of scriptural referencing to go around.

U.S. Ambassador to France Jane Hartley was the highest-ranking U.S. official among leaders from Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain.

The VA Drive-By\n\nOn Thursday, Obama\u2019s motorcade drove past the Phoenix VA hospital where the VA wait-list scandal began last year. The move prompted a barrage of criticism from Republicans who accused the president of ignoring the troubled hospital for a photo op and speech about housing.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama needs a public relations specialist,\u201d Rose said. \u201cFor him not to stop by a VA hospital illustrates was another missed opportunity.\u201d\n\n3. Golfing After James Foley\u2019s Death\n\nObama had strong words after American photojournalist James Foley was beheaded in August by a member of the Islamic State, but that was overshadowed when Obama went golfing the same day, becoming the dominant news photo the next day.\n\n4. Fundraising after Malaysian Jet Crash\n\nAfter the Malaysia Airlines jet went down over Ukraine, killing nearly 300 people, it didn\u2019t stop the president from attending a fundraising event for the Democratic National Committee in New York that evening.\n\n5. Moon Landing Anniversary\n\nWhat could have been a welcome bit of positive news and a non-controversial event for the White House in July became a transparency issue. On July 22, Obama met with the surviving crew members of Appollo 11 and Neil Armstrong\u2019s widow, Carol, to mark the 45th anniversary of the moon landing. But far from making it a large event, Obama refused to allow reporters and TV cameras into the meeting. Only still photographers were allowed to see the event, prompting the White House Correspondents Association to lodge a formal complaint.\n\n6. Golf and Ebola\n\nObama achieved a milestone in what many critics say has been a characteristic of his presidency: he played his 200th game of golf in October \u2014 the same day a second American was diagnosed with Ebola virus.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:04:40.615+0000", "event": "articles"}

Bernie Sanders travelled diagonally through the Palmetto State in two days, one message reverberated with him: Black Lives Matter.\n\nThis weekend was the first time Sanders (I-Vermont) visited South Carolina since he announced his campaign to become the next Democratic president, and he brought his populist message to the state\u2019s voters in full force \u2014 drawing large crowds in the heavily Republican state.\n\nAnd while Sanders stood in front of seas of doting, mostly white supporters, promising to be the person to end institutional racism once and for all, the 73-year-old also privately met with the state\u2019s black leaders.\n\nAccording to a black pastor who met with Sanders over the weekend, white liberals are enamored by Sanders and blacks are wildly curious about him. Speaking to TheBlaze on the condition of anonymity, the pastor said that while Sanders still seems out of touch with \u201cdisenfranchised black folk,\u201d his messaging seems to be getting better over time.\n\n\u201cIf elected president of the United States, let me be very clear,\u201d Sanders stated Saturday in North Charleston, a city with a majority black population. \u201cAnd that is nobody will fight harder to end institutional racism and to reform our broken criminal justice system.\u201d He\u2019s repeated that promise multiple times on the campaign trail.\n\n\u201cThe bad news is, as everyone in this room today knows, that racism still remains a much-too-real part of American society. No one can deny that,\u201d Sanders said, recalling the 21-year-old white man who walked into a historically black Charleston church and fatally shot nine members.\n\nSanders read off a list of black people who\u2019ve died during altercations with police or while in police custody and called for a change, slamming police departments nationwide for being too \u201cheavily militarized.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must be very clear that we are going to end institutional racism and we are going to transform and make radical changes in a criminal justice system that is broken,\u201d Sanders said.\n\nAntonia Okafor, a black 25-year-old student activist, told TheBlaze that Sanders had some validity by discussing issues that heavily affect blacks. But she argued that while it\u2019s beneficial for candidates like Sanders to focus on minority demands that have arisen from the Black Lives Matter movement, the policies presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul (R-Kentucky) has proposed \u2014 such as criminal justice reform, school choice and economic freedom zones \u2014 would be better suited to help blacks.\n\n\u201cThose are solutions that heavily affect African-American and Latino populations,\u201d Okafor said. \u201cThose solutions actually lift people out of poverty and alleviate many of the concerns that minority populations have.\u201d\n\n\u201c[Sanders] is playing on the false promise Democrats have been promising the African-American community for generations,\u201d said Okafor, the Texas coordinator for Paul\u2019s grassroots student organization, Students for Rand. \u201cThey basically stereotype us to think that what\u2019s best for us is dependency on the government.\u201d\n\nAfter Sanders abandoned his stage and microphone when Black Lives Matter activists took over his event in Seattle earlier this month, Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign hired Symone Sanders, a young black activist, as his national press secretary.\n\n\u201cToday we know, our voting rights as well as our family values, our quality of education and black lives are under attack,\u201d she said before introducing Sanders in Charleston. \u201cWe know we still have work to do, and with it we need people we trust leading this country to get the work done.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina\u2019s Republican roots provide an \u201cinteresting dynamic\u201d for Sanders\u2019 populist platform, Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative, told TheBlaze in an interview.\n\n\u201cSouth Carolina is an interesting place and he\u2019s going to have to figure [his] message out or else he\u2019ll just have trouble winning this primary or even getting close,\u201d Sellers, 30, said.\n\n\u201cHis challenge now is getting that message into the places where African-Americans congregate, eat, sleep and pray,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cIt still has yet to be seen whether or not he will meet voters where they are. I believe that he\u2019s willing to; it\u2019s just a challenge to say the least.\u201d\n\nBut Sellers said the more Sanders has remained on the campaign trail, the more he\u2019s evolved his message \u2014 and the more he has developed as a candidate.\n\nStill, black leaders in South Carolina who spoke to TheBlaze expressed concerns that while Sanders\u2019 talking points sound good, he still hasn\u2019t quite grasped the full reasoning behind their quest for racial equality \u2014 and Sellers agreed, telling TheBlaze that he shares that \u201chesitation about Bernie.\u201d\n\nCiting the recent mistrial in the Charlotte police officer\u2019s case and another young black man fatally shot by police in St. Louis on Wednesday, Sellers said many black South Carolinians want to see are more than mere talking points.\n\n\u201cThere are lives that are being lost, and so I think that Bernie has put off and has a hard time grappling with the anger and the visceral emotions that many African-Americans are going through now,\u201d Sellers said. \u201cI think there are some who really want him to grasp that, and he is starting to. I just don\u2019t know if it will be enough.\u201d\n\nFor D.C. Swinton, a black community organizer in Baltimore, Sanders\u2019 populist message \u2014 specifically him discussing plans to grow the middle class and keep people out of poverty \u2014 is a tailor-made message for South Carolina, the state where Swinton was raised. Swinton also said Sanders needs to focus more on education, specifically blaming school choice for what he sees as the \u201cresegregation of schools.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf [Sanders] can reach out to folks who consistently vote Republican and talk about how he wants to help them and not corporate interests, he could sway some of them,\u201d Swinton told TheBlaze.\n\nSwinton unsuccessfully ran for a state representative seat in South Carolina in 2010 and 2012.\n\nSanders\u2019 anti-corporate rhetoric while campaigning in South Carolina often harkened back to the Occupy movement with harsh criticism directed toward the \u201c1 percent,\u201d or the wealthiest Americans. The issue of inequality, Sanders said, is today\u2019s greatest moral, economic and political issue.\n\n\u201cAnd what we are saying in this campaign is something no other candidate will say, and that is we cannot bring about the kind of changes that we need in this country unless there is a political revolution,\u201d Sanders said in North Charleston to cheers.\n\nGrowing the economy, especially through small businesses, is instrumental, especially within minority communities, Zuri Davis told TheBlaze\n\n\u201cBernie Sanders is not the candidate for minorities, especially for the black community. His participation in the civil rights movement was very much appreciated, but his economic illiteracy is dangerous,\u201d the black 19-year-old said. \u201dFor far too long, the black community has suffered under terrible economic policy, facing barriers to entry for local business. We need a candidate with sound economics.\u201d\n\nThe Florida native said her family\u2019s small business helped them prosper despite living in a time and area where racial prejudice and segregation was prevalent.\n\n\u201cSmall business has helped many in my community make a good living, as well as give back to the community,\u201d said Davis, an editorial assistant for Rare Politics, a libertarian-leaning online news site. \u201cThe community knows what it needs, and we cannot prosper when we are held down by poor economics.\u201d\n\nAs Sanders climbs in the polls and begins to gain on Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, Sellers said it\u2019s important for Sanders to continue to focus on criminal justice reform \u2014 something he and Paul has in common \u2014 and education.\n\nSanders hasn\u2019t been the only Democratic presidential contender who\u2019s experienced media-grabbing gaffes with the Black Lives Matter crowd \u2014 which may have played an important part in the evolution of his message to minority groups.\n\nWhile two black sisters sang Republican frontrunner Donald Trump\u2019s praises all the way to YouTube stardom, Clinton told a group of Black Lives Matter activists that she would only address their concerns with white people and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley walked back his statement of \u201call lives matter\u201d in response to a group of activists.\n\nBut from what Sellers said, these situations can help candidates advance on their messaging, including Vice President Joe Biden if he does decide to run for office.\n\n\u201cYou have three white Democrats who are 70-years-old, trying to adjust in a campaign setting that\u2019s fit for 2015, in a world that\u2019s quickly becoming browner and younger,\u201d Sellers said.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Kaitlyn Schallhorn (@K_Schallhorn) on Twitter", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:04:49.667+0000", "event": "articles"}

Adam Schiff called for the end of the investigative House committee on Benghazi he sits on, Republicans questioned just how much time Schiff has devoted to the committee.\n\nSchiff, who penned his frustration with the House\u2019s Select Committee on Benghazi in a New York Times editorial Friday, slammed the committee for being \u201clittle more than a partisan tool to influence the presidential race\u201d and detailed his apprehension when asked to join the committee. However, House Republicans had an important note to underscore Schiff\u2019s complaints \u2014 the California Democrat has only attended one out of the more than 45 Benghazi interviews.\n\n\u201cIn fact, save for voting no to create the committee and then attending a press event on the now well-disproven Democrat talking point that all has been \u2018asked and answered,\u2019 Mr. Schiff has largely been a Member of the committee in absentia,\u201d a statement from Jamal Ware, spokesperson for the committee Republicans, said.\n\n\u201cIf Mr. Schiff truly cared about Benghazi and getting to the truth and contributing to the final, definitive accounting of what happened before, during and after the Benghazi terrorist attack, he would not sit on the outside casting stones and titling at Democrat strawmen, he would actually show up and help guide the direction of the investigation,\u201d Ware said.\n\nSchiff\u2019s uncertainty about the committee has been prevalent since the beginning for him. In a May 2014 statement, Schiff said he didn\u2019t believe in the need for another investigative committee on Benghazi, but would join the committee \u201d if it was felt [he] could add value.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was asked to join the Select Committee, I was deeply skeptical about its true mission, and questioned whether I \u2014 or any other Democrat \u2014 should participate. After eight investigations, what could a ninth contribute? But I was determined to do my part,\u201d Schiff wrote in his Times editorial. \u201cSince its formation, the Select Committee on Benghazi has been aimless and slow moving, not knowing what it was looking for or where. It has acted in a deeply partisan way, frequently failing to consult or even to inform Democratic members before taking action, and selectively leaking information to the press. After 16 months and more than $4 million, the committee has gained no additional insight into the attacks in Benghazi. It has nothing new to tell the families of those killed or the American people.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner, Patrick Boland, Schiff\u2019s spokesperson, dismissed the Republicans\u2019 statement as their attempt \u201cto distract from the fact that after representing a schedule earlier this year that would have already seen 10 public hearings, they have managed to hold precisely one \u2014 eight months ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s apparent that the metric for success of the Benghazi Committee is the political damage done to Secretary Clinton, not the search for the truth,\u201d Boland said.\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) called Ware\u2019s statement \u201dbizarre, highly defensive and erratic\u201d and questioned whether Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) had approved the statement before its release.\n\n\u201cI do not know if Chairman Gowdy approved his press staffer\u2019s statement, but it attacked members of Congress in a direct and offensive manner that I have never seen before,\u201d Cummings said, according to the Washington Examiner. \u201cIf the Chairman did not approve it, he may want to consider whether this individual is the appropriate person to represent the Benghazi Committee to the press and the American people.\u201d\n\nMy oped in the New York Times this morning: \"Disband the Benghazi Committee.\" http://t.co/7fdgYenBlL via @nytopinion \u2014 Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) September 4, 2015", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:04:51.951+0000", "event": "articles"}

Tom Harkin\u2019s annual steak fry fundraiser in rural Indianola. Sunday\u2019s event was expected to draw more than 5,000 party activists who form the backbone of Iowa\u2019s presidential campaigns every four years.\n\nFollowing a summertime book tour, Clinton was making her biggest campaign splash in 2014 so far, opening a fall of fundraising and campaigning for Democrats who are trying to maintain a Senate majority during President Barack Obama\u2019s final two years. The event was serving as a farewell for Harkin, a liberal stalwart and former presidential candidate who is retiring after four decades in Congress.\n\nObama defeated Clinton in the state\u2019s leadoff presidential caucuses in January 2008, and the former secretary of state has not returned since. Iowa Democrats said Clinton remained widely popular and predicted she would receive broad support if she chooses to run again.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama was a phenomenon. He just was. I\u2019ll give him credit, he worked hard in Iowa, but so did she,\u201d Harkin said, when asked whether Clinton would do things differently in the state if she runs in 2016.\n\nOn Sunday, party activists streamed onto a hot-air balloon field lined with colorful signs thanking the Harkins and promoting state candidates like Rep. Bruce Braley, who is running for Senate. Ready for Hillary, a super PAC supporting a potential Clinton candidacy, posted light blue \u201cReady\u201d signs to promote the main speaker. On stage sat a quintessential Iowa tableau: bales of hay, an American flag and two tractors parked in the surrounding field.\n\n\u201cI honestly believe she will be the next president,\u201d said Cindy Sturtz, a union member from Fort Dodge, who caucused for Obama in 2008 but says she plans to support Clinton if she runs again.\n\nThe Clintons\u2019 arrival offered the possibility of a fresh start for the former New York senator and first lady, whose campaign stumbled in the months leading to the caucuses.\n\nAnti-war activists opposed her vote to authorize the Iraq war in 2002 and coalesced around Obama, who had opposed the war as an Illinois state senator. Clinton was often insulated by a large entourage in a state where face-to-face politics has long been a campaign hallmark.\n\nClinton, who has conferred with Iowa Democrats in recent days, would enter a presidential campaign with a large advantage over potential rivals. Early polls have shown her leading other Democrats by wide margins, including Vice President Joe Biden and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley.\n\nBiden is traveling to Des Moines next week and has not closed the possibility of another campaign while O\u2019Malley has made several visits to the state and dispatched staffers to Iowa this fall.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is considering a presidential campaign, said in an interview with NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d that there was \u201cprofound anger at the greed on Wall Street\u201d and at the nation\u2019s political establishment. Sanders said \u201cthe issue is not Hillary\u201d but the decline in middle-class standard of living and the gap between rich and poor. \u201cThe American people want change,\u201d he said.\n\nHarkin\u2019s final steak fry was expected to be the largest since Hillary Clinton\u2019s last appearance in 2007, when she was joined by Obama, Biden and other Democrats running for president. Bill Clinton has appeared at the event three previous times.\n\nClinton has said she expects to decide on another campaign early next year.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Catherine Lucey and Thomas Beaumont contributed to this report.", "score": 4, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:05:29.038+0000", "event": "articles"}

Jeb will never be able to secure our border, negotiate good trade deals, strengthen our military or care for our veterans.

Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) is now part of the controversy surrounding the former secretary of state because he waited until after the news broke to issue a subpoena for documents pertaining to the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.\n\nGowdy, the appointed chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, has gained national media attention for his animated and often dramatic Capitol Hill exchanges.

Gimme a break,\u201d Bush said. \u201cDo we want to win? Do we want to insult 53 percent of all voters?\u201d the former Florida governor told the RedState Gathering in Atlanta, where Trump had been the headliner for an evening reception at the College Football Hall of Fame.\n\n\u201cWhat Donald Trump said is wrong,\u201d Bush continued \u201cThat is not how we win elections. And worse yet that is not how you bring people together to solve problems \u2026 Mr. Trump ought to apologize.\u201d\n\nThe event\u2019s organizer, radio host Erick Erickson, offered similar sentiments when he booted Trump after his statements on CNN. \u201cI just don\u2019t want someone on stage who gets a hostile question from a lady and his first inclination is to imply it was hormonal,\u201d Erickson wrote on his website, even as he acknowledged that Trump \u201cresonates with a lot of people with his bluntness.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Trump maintained that \u201conly a deviant\u201d would interpret his comments that way. He called Erickson \u201ca total loser\u201d with \u201ca history of supporting establishment losers in failed campaigns.\u201d\n\nFormer tech executive Carly Fiorina, the only woman among the GOP contenders, took to Twitter: \u201cMr. Trump. There. Is. No. Excuse.\u201d She added, \u201cI stand with @megynkelly.\u201d\n\nRick Perry, the former Texas governor, said Trump\u2019s behavior shows \u201ca serious lack of character and basic decency\u201d that should disqualify him from the race.\n\nEven before Trump\u2019s latest Kelly comments, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told CBN News that Trump has \u201cgot a lot of skills, but I just don\u2019t think for this.\u201d\n\nMike Huckabee, who also had a RedState speaking slot, just seemed exasperated by it all, asking reporters for a \u201cnon-Donald Trump question.\u201d When he got another, the former Arkansas governor quipped: \u201cI\u2019m running for president. I\u2019m not running for social media critic of somebody else who\u2019s running for president.\u201d\n\nYet Trump remains a towering presence in the 17-candidate field, and his supporters at the RedState event \u2014 along with several other uncommitted attendees \u2014 said the latest flap simply reaffirms why his uncompromising approach appeals to voters who are disgusted with conventional politicians, including those in the GOP.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like Republicans want to cherry-pick someone as the nominee and they want everyone to fall in line,\u201d said Jane Sacco of New Port Richey, Florida, saying she was angry at Erickson\u2019s decision.\n\nAnother Trump fan, Louise Tashjian of Atlanta, added: \u201cThis is about political correctness. We don\u2019t like it when Democrats do it.\u201d\n\nDulcy Forte of Austin, Texas, countered that Trump\u2019s bigger sin was his refusal in the debate to pledge support to the eventual GOP nominee if it\u2019s not him. \u201cI was always thought Donald Trump was a little crude, but, more importantly, he\u2019s not a good Republican,\u201d Forte said.\n\nStill more attendees said they are not necessarily Trump supporters but want other candidates and party leaders to take heed of his rise.\n\nConnie Thomas of Atlanta, executive of a health care consultancy, said Trump went \u201ctoo far\u201d in the CNN interview but is serving a \u201cgood purpose\u201d in the race: \u201cHe\u2019s forcing the rest of this field to speak more forcefully, more clearly against the establishment.\u201d\n\nJack Staver, a business consultant from Woodstock, Georgia, said Trump\u2019s rivals could benefit from emulating his style, even if it gets him into trouble. \u201cQuit being who everybody wants you to be, and be who you are,\u201d Staver said. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a lot of that in this campaign.\u201d\n\nSome other candidates have at least tacitly acknowledged the tightrope they must walk with Trump\u2019s supporters.\n\nBush was the only one of a half-dozen candidates at the RedState gathering who mentioned Trump during his remarks on the podium.

And a Senate gatekeeper for the legislation is siding with the prosecutors.\n\nCiting a recent report by federal prosecutors, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) would oppose any laws that would reduce sentencing for major drug offenders.\n\n\u201cWhile drug offenders accounted for a large percentage of the federal prison population in 2013 and 2014, virtually all of those were convicted of major drug trafficking crimes, including the trafficking and sale of significant amounts of dangerous drugs like heroin, methamphetamine, cocaine, crack cocaine, and oxycodone,\u201d said a report by the National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys.\n\nWhile U.S. attorneys are presidential appointees, assistant U.S. attorneys are frontline career federal prosecutors that frequently serve through several administrations in both parties and are less inclined to be political.\n\n\u201cChairman Grassley has made this same point several times in speeches on the Senate floor,\u201d Grassley spokeswoman Beth Levine told TheBlaze. \u201cHe\u2019s heard from the assistant U.S. attorneys about their concerns and he is very aware of the need to keep high-level drug traffickers off the street. He has no intention of letting these serious offenders off the hook by reducing their sentences.\u201d\n\nCongress is preparing to move forward on sentencing reform. Grassley said earlier this month he was open to working out a bipartisan deal on the broader issue of criminal justice reform. Beyond drug sentencing, the issue involves other mandatory sentencing matters such as \u201cover-criminalization,\u201d mandatory minimums and restoring voting rights for felons.\n\nThe White House referred TheBlaze to the Justice Department, which has not responded after two days of inquiry.\n\nLast month House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Good latt\u00e9 (R-Va.) and the committee\u2019s ranking member Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.) announced a criminal justice reform initiative to handle issues separately, such as sentencing reform, prison and reentry reform. The committee held a hearing and heard from members of Congress on the matter.\n\n\u201cAdditionally, the committee will take into consideration the opinions and expertise of those who serve on the front lines of the criminal justice system, including federal prosecutors,\u201d a House Judiciary Committee aide told TheBlaze.\n\nThe report from federal prosecutors says about half of all federal inmates are incarcerated for drug offenses, much higher than the percentage in states, as critics point out. But the report adds there is a reason for that.\n\n\u201cThis stems from the somewhat obvious fact that federal criminal jurisdiction over murders, rapes, and robberies (crimes that are largely intrastate), is limited and those crimes are, for the most part, prosecuted in state courts,\u201d the NAUSA report says. \u201cLarge scale drug trafficking (activity that is inherently interstate and international in nature) is proportionately more often investigated and prosecuted in the federal system. As a result, the federal system focuses on, and the federal prisons house, many of the most dangerous and serious drug traffickers\u2014offenders that are often violent, repeat offenders involved in high level, large scale trafficking.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:05:56.899+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 896, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 White House hopes for stopping a congressional challenge to the Iran nuclear deal and sparing President Barack Obama from using a veto suffered a blow when a key Senate Democrat announced his opposition.\n\nThe setback came Friday in the announcement from Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, that he opposes the deal, which he said \u201clegitimizes Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\u201d\n\nCardin\u2019s move doesn\u2019t affect the ultimate outcome for the international accord to curb Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions in exchange for relief from economic sanctions. The White House already clinched the necessary Senate votes to ensure that even if Obama ends up having to veto a disapproval resolution set for a vote next week, his veto would be upheld.\n\nBut with that support in hand and more piling up, the White House and congressional backers of the deal had begun aiming for a more ambitious goal: enough commitments to bottle up the disapproval resolution in the Senate with a filibuster, preventing it from even coming to a final vote.\n\nWith Cardin\u2019s announcement, that goal remains in reach, but it will be tougher to attain.\n\n\u201cThis is a close call, but after a lengthy review, I will vote to disapprove the deal,\u201d Cardin wrote in an opinion piece in The Washington Post. \u201cAfter 10 to 15 years, it would leave Iran with the option to produce enough enriched fuel for a nuclear weapon in a short time.\u201d\n\nCardin made his announcement as Obama met at the White House with King Salman of Saudi Arabia, in part to offer assurances that the deal signed by the U.S., Iran, Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia comes with the necessary resources to help check Iran\u2019s regional ambitions. Saudi officials have cautiously supported the deal but are worried about enforcement and whether an Iranian government flush with cash after sanctions are lifted will wreak havoc throughout the Middle East.\n\nBefore the meeting began, Obama told reporters in the Oval Office that the leaders would discuss \u201cimplementing the deal to ensure that Iran does not have a nuclear weapon, while counteracting its destabilizing activities in the region.\u201d\n\nAt a news conference at the Saudi Embassy, foreign minister Adel Al-Jubeir said his government endorses the Iran nuclear deal, having been assured by Obama that it will block Iran\u2019s path to a nuclear weapon.\n\n\u201cWe have looked at the details of this agreement and we have come to the conclusion that this does in fact meet that test,\u201d he said. \u201cWe believe that this will contribute to the security and stability within the region.\u201d\n\nAl-Jubeir said Salman and Obama discussed a plan to improve American military cooperation with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, announced after a Camp David summit in May that Salman declined to attend.\n\nIn contrast to Al-Jubeir\u2019s sunny portrayal of U.S.-Saudi relations, Saudi officials in Riyadh said that the kingdom is displeased with the Iran deal and looking to expand its alliances beyond the U.S.\n\nSaudi officials said the king sought a written agreement from Obama stating that the U.S. is \u201cprepared to defend against any attempt that threatens the security\u201d of the Gulf Cooperation Council, a coalition of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Oman.\n\nThe officials say Obama has been hesitant to follow through because the agreement implicitly refers to Gulf concerns about Iran, and the Saudis feel Washington is unwilling to make such a commitment due to its rapprochement with Iran. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nWith all but a handful of Senate Democrats already stating their positions \u2014 and only two opposed to the deal \u2014 Cardin was the critical outstanding vote. In addition to serving as top Foreign Relations Democrat, he was an author of legislation providing for congressional review of the Iran deal. As a leading Jewish Democrat, he was also under strong pressure from segments of the Jewish community to turn down the deal, which is ardently opposed by Israel.\n\nCardin\u2019s announcement came moments after Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado announced that he would back the deal. Bennet, who is up for re-election next year in a battleground state, said the agreement is flawed but represents an important step toward the objectives of preventing Iran from attaining a nuclear weapon, ensuring Israel\u2019s security and avoiding war in the Middle East.\n\nBennet\u2019s support put backers of the agreement just three votes shy of the 41 they would need to filibuster the resolution and block it from passing. But Cardin\u2019s opposition could be enough to prevent those three additional votes from emerging. Only five senators have yet to announce where they stand: Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Maria Cantwell of Washington, Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Gary Peters of Michigan.\n\nSeveral of those are seen as possible \u201cno\u201d votes. The other two senators opposing the deal are Bob Menendez of New Jersey and Chuck Schumer of New York.\n\nIn the House, some 110 Democrats were on record supporting the deal as of Friday, with around 15 opposed.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:06:11.526+0000", "event": "articles"}

Appearing in the top ten were three people who have yet to run for national office.\n\nBen Carson (fourth place) and Donald Trump (eighth place) may not be too surprising, as they are names regularly seen on television or in the news. However, finishing in ninth place was a relative political newcomer, Carly Fiorina. The former Hewlett-Packard CEO finished ahead of well-known political figures and former governors like Chris Christie, Rick Perry, Bobby Jindal and Sarah Palin.\n\nFiorina\u2019s ninth place finish, accomplished without the benefit of an organized ground campaign so often seen at CPAC, indicates to some that she may be a legitimate \u201cdark horse\u201d candidate for 2016. Asked at CPAC if she minded the term \u201cdark horse,\u201d Fiorina replied, \u201cOf course not.\u201d\n\nOn this week\u2019s episode of TheBlaze Radio\u2019s \u201cPure Opelka,\u201d Fiorina talked about her vision for the country and why Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u201cDo as I say, not as I do\u201d example is wearing thin with America.\n\nFiorina, who started her career as a secretary, typing and filing papers for a small real estate office, but ended up running the largest technology company in the world, sounded very much like a presidential candidate. Especially when she talked about restoring opportunity for all Americans by focusing on getting government out of the way of small businesses.\n\n\u201cWe have to fundamentally reform government. Because government has grown so powerful, so costly, so corrupt, so complicated that only the big, the powerful, the well-connected can deal with this powerful government,\u201d adding, \u201cIn fact, we are crushing the potential of this nation under the weight of government.\u201d\n\nFiorina added some perspective on America\u2019s standing in the world. She talked about the need for the country to be seen in a position of leadership: \u201cWe have to restore American leadership in the world. The world\u2019s a more dangerous place when we\u2019re not leading. And we have allies begging us to lead \u2014 that\u2019s why Bibi Netanyahu came here \u2014 he is begging us to lead.\u201d\n\nWhile discussing Hillary Clinton, the democrats\u2019 presumed 2016 candidate, Fiorina had some sharp criticism for the former first lady.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton does not understand that a critical part of leadership is transparency,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd the reason transparency is so important for leadership is because people want to know that the leader they are preparing to follow is of good character and good motivation and high competence.\u201d\n\nAddressing the democrats oft-mentioned \u201cwar on women,\u201d Fiorina drove home the stark contradiction between what Mrs. Clinton says and what she does. \u201cHillary Clinton for example loves to tweet about women\u2019s rights in Silicon Valley or women\u2019s rights in the United States, but at the same time the Clinton Foundation is taking money from, for example, the government of Algeria, while Hillary Clinton is secretary of state. And the government of Algeria denies women the most basic human rights.\u201d\n\nFiorina went on to stress that the 2016 presidential election is a \u201cmust win\u201d for the GOP.\n\nTo secure this win, the former CEO says, \u201dWe must hold Hillary Clinton and the Democrats to account.\u201d Fiorina continued, \u201cWe have to hold her to account for her track record, for her actions, for her lack of accomplishment and for her lack of leadership.\u201d\n\nAfter talking about the need to hold Clinton\u2019s feet to the fire, Fiorina stated she was \u201cwilling to do that.\u201d Asked where she stood on a possible 2016 run, Fiorina talked about getting \u201ccloser\u201d to making a decision, stating she \u201cprobably will make a final decision and an announcement towards the end of April.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Hillary Clinton told thousands of supporters, \u201cI really do hope we have a woman president in my lifetime.\u201d While the former secretary of state was obviously talking about herself, there are many people who think that first \u201cwoman president\u201d could be Carly Fiorina.\n\nListen to the interview with Carly Fiorina here:\n\n\n\n__\n\nFollow Mike Opelka (@Stuntbrain) on Twitter.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:06:30.078+0000", "event": "articles"}

John McCain\u2019s military service marks a turning point in the party\u2019s cautious approach to the billionaire-turned-presidential candidate.\n\nBut Trump simply may not care; indeed he seemed to bask in his McCain takedown.\n\nAfter dismissing McCain\u2019s reputation as a war hero because he was captured in Vietnam and \u201cI like people who weren\u2019t captured,\u201d Trump declared \u201cI will say what I want to say.\u201d He insisted he would stay in the GOP primary field, despite rivals who say he\u2019s now shown he doesn\u2019t merit the presidency.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just absurd,\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive. It\u2019s ridiculous. And I do think it is a disqualifier as commander in chief.\u201d\n\nNumerous other GOP candidates, including Jeb Bush, Rick Perry and Scott Walker, were similarly critical of Trump. The Republican National Committee also put its thumb on the scale, issuing a statement saying \u201cthere is no place in our party or our country for comments that disparage those who have served honorably.\u201d\n\nAs the furor unfolded, Trump spoke dismissively of his rivals and the GOP establishment in an interview with The Associated Press, recalling his years of helping to bankroll candidates.\n\n\u201cYou know the Republican Party \u2014 of course I was one of their darlings when I was a contributor,\u201d he said. \u201cI went from a darling to somebody that they\u2019re not happy with because I\u2019m not a politician.\u201d\n\nAsked whether he now thought McCain was a war hero, Trump merely referred to his previous day\u2019s comments, when he said \u201cperhaps\u201d he was while seeming to mock McCain for being captured.\n\nWhen he was asked Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d if he owed McCain an apology, Trump said, \u201cNo, not at all.\u201d\n\nUntil now, Republicans have been largely cautious in their handling of Trump and his provocations.\n\nWhile officials privately fretted about the damage he could do to the party, they are also worried about alienating voters drawn to his celebrity, brashness and willingness to take on establishment Republicans. He\u2019s emerged as one of the favorites early in a race that is bound to see shifts in the standing of many of the candidates.\n\nTrump has made other eyebrow-raising comments since declaring his candidacy, most notably his assertion that Mexican immigrants are rapists and drug dealers. Many GOP candidates were slow and halting in their response to those comments, underscoring a continuing struggle to hit the right notes on immigration when they want to appeal to Hispanics without alienating traditional GOP voters.\n\nBut for a party that prides itself on its support for the military, Trump\u2019s comments about McCain were an easy opening. McCain, the 2008 GOP presidential nominee, spent more than five years as a prisoner of war, enduring torture and refusing release ahead of fellow captives.\n\nDemocrats reminded voters about the tepid response to his earlier bombast. Democratic presidential contender Hillary Rodham Clinton said it was shameful \u201cthat it took so long for most of his fellow Republican candidates to start standing up to him.\u201d\n\nTrump noted he got a standing ovation after his remarks to a religious conservative forum in Iowa and told the AP \u201cwhen I left the room, everybody thought I gave the best presentation of anybody.\u201d But his comments about McCain drew a smattering of boos, his rivals received standing ovations, too, and when some of them spoke up for McCain in their remarks, they got hearty applause.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all Trump, all the time.\u201d Share:\n\nTo some Republicans, Trump will have a detrimental effect on other candidates.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all Trump, all the time,\u201d said Matt Strawn, the former Iowa GOP chairman. For candidates still introducing themselves to voters and trying to qualify for the party\u2019s first debate Aug. 6, Strawn said, \u201cit is all but impossible for them to cut through the Trump noise.\u201d Although polls this early in a presidential contest are of dubious reliability, they are being used to determine who can come to the debate, and Trump appears likely to make the cut.\n\nPennsylvania GOP chairman Rob Gleason doesn\u2019t mind the fuss kicked up by Trump.\n\n\u201cNow there\u2019s more people interested in what the Republican Party has to say,\u201d Gleason said. \u201cIt\u2019s all good.\u201d\n\nAlso looming over the GOP: The prospect Trump could run as a third-party candidate if he doesn\u2019t win the GOP nomination. Trump declined to rule that out Saturday.\n\nGOP pollster Frank Luntz said Trump could siphon off enough votes as a third-party candidate to cost the party the White House.\n\n\u201cIf you tell me Trump is running as an independent, I will tell you that the next president will be Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Luntz, a moderator at the Iowa forum who asked Trump about McCain being a war hero.\n\nRick Perry, one of the few veterans running for president, said Trump has demonstrated he has neither the character nor the temperament for the White House. \u201cOver the top,\u201d the former Texas governor said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201dReally offensive.\u201d Bush tweeted, \u201cEnough with the slanderous attacks.\u201d\n\nTrump pressed ahead Sunday with his critical remarks on McCain, who had no comment.

Pat McCrory, a Republican, told TheBlaze.\n\nNorth Carolina is one of 26 states in the case seeking to stop the actions Obama took without Congress to shield 5 million illegal immigrants from deportation.\n\nOn Monday, Texas U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen issued a temporary injunction halting Obama\u2019s actions, granting the 26 states time to pursue a lawsuit. On Friday, the Justice Department announced it would seek an emergency stay to block Hanen\u2019s ruling.\n\n\u201cThe injunction should continue,\u201d McCrory said. \u201cThere has been executive overreach. And I think the separation of powers issue, regardless of the issues of immigration, has to be resolved in the courts because it sets a very bad precedent.\u201d\n\nMcCrory and other governors are in Washington for the 2015 National Governors Association Winter Meeting, taking place Friday through Monday.\n\nVirginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, argued the biggest concern is the threat by Republicans in Congress to block funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement agencies that would implement Obama\u2019s executive actions.\n\n\u201cI support the president. We support the president on his efforts on immigration reform,\u201d McAuliffe told TheBlaze, referring to Democratic governors attending the conference. \u201cWe all stand with him on it. We will see what the end result of the court decision is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut separate that from this DHS funding,\u201d McAuliffe continued. \u201cIt\u2019s totally two different things. It\u2019s important. You\u2019ve got to fund the DHS. This is vital to emergency services in all of our states. But understand, next Friday, those [DHS] checks will stop going out to the states.

Despite the propaganda to the contrary, Americans mostly like their health care and don\u2019t want to end up with the crappy health care Canada has. When my father got cancer there was such a long waiting list that he couldn\u2019t get treatment for several months and was told not to worry \u2014 it\u2019s not life threatening \u2014 up until a few weeks before he died when he was told it was far too advanced for any treatment to help.\n\n2. Americans like being able to protect themselves and don\u2019t want to end up unarmed like Canadians are \u2014 where woman are forced to fear walking home at night as seen from the rash of murders in the Vancouver area about a year ago.\n\n3. Unlike Canadians, Americans prefer freedom over being taken care of by their government.\n\nJust a sampling of the many reasons U.S. voters dislike Obama more than Canadians. In Canada Obama would be welcome because he would not be striving to change the way things are done except maybe returning tax rates of 15 years ago when a person making 40k per year paid the same taxes as an American making $65k per year. But Canadians would be happy with this as long as they were just told that the government would take care of them more.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:07:51.678+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 995, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "In a primetime speech, President Barack Obama used emotional appeals and invoked scripture to announce sweeping executive action allowing nearly 5 million illegal immigrants to register for background checks, pay back taxes and not have to worry about deportations for three years.\n\n\u201cEven as we are a nation of immigrants, we are also a nation of laws,\u201d Obama said. \u201cUndocumented workers broke our immigration laws, and I believe that they must be held accountable \u2013 especially those who may be dangerous.\u201d\n\nUnder the actions, the focus of deportations will be on criminals and recent illegal border crossings. Under the executive action, the Department of Homeland Security will place anyone suspected of terrorism, violent crimes, gang members and recent illegal border crossers at the top of the deportation list.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security. Felons, not families, criminals, not children, gang members, not a mother who\u2019s working hard to provide for her kids,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019ll prioritize, just like law enforcement does every day.\u201d\n\nObama talked further about a tradition of welcoming immigrants.\n\n\u201cScripture tells us that we shall not oppress a stranger, for we know the heart of a stranger \u2013 we were strangers once, too,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMy fellow Americans, we are and always will be a nation of immigrants. We were strangers once, too.\u201d\n\nObama acknowledged that critics call the deportation relief amnesty, which he disagreed with.\n\n\u201cAmnesty is the immigration system we have today, millions of people who live here without paying their taxes or playing by the rules, while politicians use the issue to scare people and whip up votes at election time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cMass amnesty would be unfair. Mass deportations would be both impossible and contrary to our character.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019m describing is accountability, a commonsense, middle ground approach,\u201d Obama continued. \u201dIf you meet the criteria, you can come out of the shadows and get right with the law. If you\u2019re a criminal, you\u2019ll be deported. If you plan to enter the U.S. illegally, your chances of getting caught and sent back just went up.\u201d\n\nUnder the executive action, illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for more than five years and have children who are U.S. citizens or legal residents will be allowed to come forward and register for the background checks. This aspect would allow \u201cjust north of 4 million\u201d illegal immigrants to remain in the country, a White House senior official said.\n\nMany Republicans assert that Obama\u2019s action without Congress is constitutionally questionable. Obama has said he is taking action because Congress won\u2019t act. In June, Obama asked Attorney General Eric Holder and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson to review what the executive branch can do ab without Congress.\n\n\u201cThe actions I\u2019m taking are not only lawful, they\u2019re the kinds of actions taken by every single Republican president and every single Democratic president for the past half century,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd to those members of Congress who question my authority to make our immigration system work better, or question the wisdom of me acting where Congress has failed, I have one answer: pass a bill.\u201d\n\nOn another front, the president is also expand the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, or DACA, which could add another 300,000.\n\nThe expansion will eliminate the age cap from the 2012 DACA that was for no one older than 31. Also, the 2012 DACA program was for childhood arrivals who came to the United States before January 2007. That will be moved to anyone who came United States before January 2010. This group will also be exempt from deportation for three years.\n\nThe order will also include a package of immigration court reforms and expand visas for illegal immigrants who are victims of crimes or human trafficking if they cooperate with government investigators. White House officials said the shielding from deportation and work permits for illegal immigrants are temporary and revokable.\n\n\u201cAre we a nation that accepts the cruelty of ripping children from their parents\u2019 arms? Or are we a nation that values families, and works to keep them together?\u201d Obama asked. \u201dAre we a nation that educates the world\u2019s best and brightest in our universities, only to send them home to create businesses in countries that compete against us? Or are we a nation that encourages them to stay and create jobs, businesses, and industries right here in America?\u201d\n\nThe administration considered giving legal status not only to parents of legal residents, but also parents of illegal immigrants shielded under DACA. However, the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s opinion said, \u201cDHS\u2019s proposed prioritization policy and its proposed deferred action program for parents of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents would be legally permissible, but that the proposed deferred action program for parents of DACA recipients would not be permissible.\u201d\n\nThe legal opinion said out of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants, Homeland Security only has the resources to remove fewer than 400,000.\n\n\u201cWhether our forebears were strangers who crossed the Atlantic, or the Pacific, or the Rio Grande, we are here only because this country welcomed them in, and taught them that to be an American is about something more than what we look like, or what our last names are, or how we worship,\u201d Obama said.\n\nThis post has been updated to include Obama\u2019s speech, information on a legal opinion from the Justice Department and information from a briefing available after the 6 p.m. embargo.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:08:28.531+0000", "event": "articles"}

By contrast, the National Bureau of Economic Research said in a report that not extending the benefits actually added 1.8 million jobs, accounting for 61 percent of all the jobs created that year.\n\nAdvocates for extending unemployment benefits believe that the longer jobseekers search, the more likely they are to find a job. That misses the bigger picture, said NBER report co-author Iourii Manovskii, an economics professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cMore important was not how hard people looked for work, but how unemployment benefits affect firms,\u201d Manovskii told TheBlaze. \u201cTo the extent that it benefitted workers, it was more expensive to the firms.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe size of the economic pie is different for working in the marketplace and staying at home,\u201d he added. \u201cThe benefits make staying at home a less costly choice. But the pie shrinks. The firms have fewer professionals to hire. Productivity is not as high.\u201d\n\nMarcus Hagedorn of the University of Oslo and Kurt Mitman of Stockholm University were the other co-authors.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor Statistics announced this week that for the first time since 1984, annual average unemployment rates decreased from 2013 to 2014 in all 50 states and the District of Columbia:\n\nThis was the first year since 1984 in which all states and the District had over-the-year rate declines. The largest rate decline occurred in Illinois(-2.0 percentage points), followed by Colorado, North Carolina, and Ohio (-1.8 points each). Twenty additional states had over-the-year jobless rate decreases of at least 1.0 percentage point.\n\nIn his Dec. 7, 2013 weekly address about the ramifications of Congress not extending unemployment insurance, Obama warned of hurting families and harming the economy.\n\n\u201cUnemployment insurance is one of the most effective ways there is to boost our economy,\u201d Obama said in 2013. \u201cWhen people have money to spend on basic necessities, that means more customers for our businesses and, ultimately, more jobs. And the evidence shows that unemployment insurance doesn\u2019t stop people from trying hard to find work.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cA report by the Department of Labor and my Council of Economic Advisors estimated that it could cost businesses 240,000 jobs and without the ability to feed their families or pay the bills, many people currently looking for work could stop looking for good.\u201d\n\nObama and Democrats in Congress wanted to extend the unemployment insurance beyond 26 weeks for people who lost their job. During the recession, Congress routinely extended the benefits for much longer, to 53 weeks. In late 2013, the Democratic-controlled Senate passed an extension, but the Republican-controlled House did not, making 2014 the first year since the recession without extended benefits.\n\nA significant level of 2014 job growth resulted from the 1 percent drop in the unemployment benefit durations, the National Bureau of Economic Research said in its report, issued in late January, before the recent BLS numbers.\n\n\u201cIn levels, 1.8 million additional jobs were created in 2014 due to the benefit cut. Almost 1 million of these jobs were filled by workers from out of the labor force who would not have participated in the labor market had benefit extensions been reauthorized,\u201d the report said.\n\nThe report continued: \u201cIn the aggregate, our estimates imply that the cut in benefit duration accounted for about 61 percent of the aggregate employment growth in 2014.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:08:45.597+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1013, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Oliver Darcy.\n\n\u2014\n\nAUSTIN, Texas (AP) \u2014 Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis, who became a national political sensation by filibustering her state\u2019s tough new restrictions on abortion, discloses in her upcoming memoir that she had an abortion in the 1990s after discovering that the fetus had a severe brain abnormality.\n\nIn \u201cForgetting to be Afraid,\u201d Davis also writes about ending an earlier ectopic pregnancy, in which an embryo implants outside the uterus. Davis says she considered revealing the terminated pregnancies during her nearly 13-hour speech on the floor of the Texas Senate last summer \u2014 but decided against it, saying \u201csuch an unexpected and dramatically personal confession would overshadow the events of the day.\u201d\n\nThe Associated Press purchased an early copy of the book, which goes on sale Tuesday.\n\nBoth pregnancies happened before Davis, a state senator from Fort Worth, began her political career and after she was already a mother to two young girls. Davis catapulted to national Democratic stardom after her filibuster temporarily delayed passed of sweeping new abortion restrictions. She\u2019s now running for governor against Republican Attorney General Greg Abbott, who is heavily favored to replace Republican Gov. Rick Perry next year.\n\nThe second pregnancy happened in 1996. Davis writes that during her second trimester she took a blood test that could determine chromosomal or neural defects, which doctors first told her didn\u2019t warrant concern. But a later exam revealed that the brain of the fetus had developed in complete separation on the right and left sides, Davis says. She sought opinions from multiple doctors, who told her the baby would be deaf, blind and in a permanent vegetative state if she survived delivery, she writes.\n\n\u201cI could feel her little body tremble violently, as if someone were applying an electric shock to her, and I knew then what I needed to do,\u201d Davis writes. \u201cShe was suffering.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to say that an \u201cindescribable blackness followed\u201d the pregnancy and that the loss left her forever changed.\n\nThe ectopic pregnancy happened in 1994, and terminating it was considered medically necessary, Davis writes. Such pregnancies generally aren\u2019t considered viable, meaning the fetus can\u2019t survive, and they can endanger the mother\u2019s life. But Davis writes that in Texas, it\u2019s \u201ctechnically considered an abortion, and doctors have to report it as such.\u201d\n\nDavis\u2019 filibuster in June 2013 set off a chaotic scene in the Texas Capitol that extended past midnight. Thousands of people watched it online, with President Barack Obama at one point tweeting, \u201cSomething special is happening in Austin tonight.\u201d\n\nIn the book, Davis recalls reading testimony during the filibuster about a woman who had had an abortion after learning her daughter would be born with a terminal illness. She says the story could have been hers and writes about her hands shaking and wiping tears from her eyes.\n\nDavis\u2019 filibuster only temporarily delayed the restrictions, which passed overwhelmingly when Perry called a special legislative session. The measure requires doctors who perform abortion to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and mandates that clinics upgrade its facilities to hospital-level operating standards. A federal judge in Austin last month blocked a portion of the law that would have left Texas with only seven abortion facilities statewide.\n\nAnti-abortion groups, including those that have attacked Davis\u2019 candidacy, expressed sympathy for the tough choice Davis confronted with the second terminated pregnancy but said they hoped all decisions end in choosing to continue a pregnancy.\n\n\u201cWhile our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious.\u201d Share:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an incredibly difficult position for anyone to find themselves in. While our heart goes out for the decision she had to make, again, still the value of life is precious,\u201d Texans Right to Life spokeswoman Melissa Conway said Friday night.\n\nAbbott spokesman Matt Hirsch did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nCecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood and the daughter of former Texas Gov. Ann Richards praised Davis\u2019 \u201cunwavering courage\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are grateful to her for sharing her story and shining a light on a subject that is too often hidden in the shadows of shame and stigma by people like Greg Abbott and his allies,\u201d Richards said.\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:08:53.275+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1015, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Jeb Bush\u2019s fundraising network is two generations in the making, and it shows.\n\nAbout half of the roughly $120 million raised to help him win the Republican presidential nomination comes from donors who previously gave to his brother or father, both former presidents, according to a new analysis of Federal Election Commission records by Crowdpac.com, a nonpartisan political research company.\n\nThe finding puts a numerical exclamation point on the advantage Bush\u2019s presidential family gives him when it comes to fundraising.\n\nIn Crowdpac\u2019s review of named contributors to three political committees helping Bush, $59.2 million came from first-time Bush donors, while $60.3 million came from returning donors to the earlier campaigns of President George W. Bush, President George H.W. Bush or both.\n\nOne such Bush family stalwart is Dirk Van Dongen, president of the Washington-based National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. Van Dongen said he is one of a \u201chuge\u201d network of volunteer fundraisers \u2013 called \u201cbundlers\u201d because they gather checks from friends and associates to turn over to campaigns \u2013 who sprang to action when the former Florida governor said at the beginning of the year that he was thinking about running.\n\n\u201cIt is a vast network built over decades and it has grown even larger since Gov. Bush announced his candidacy,\u201d he said. \u201cNo other Republican candidate comes close to matching it.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the money raised in the first six months of the year by Bush\u2019s campaign, leadership political action committee and super PAC is more than double that of anyone else in the 17-person Republican primary race.\n\nFundraising materials for Jeb Bush show clear echoes of techniques his brother mastered. George W. Bush\u2019s 2004 re-election had a sales-force quality. Top George W. Bush money-raisers called \u201cRangers,\u201d \u201cPioneers\u201d and \u201cMavericks\u201d were rewarded with perks like trips to meet with the president. Jeb Bush\u2019s top fundraisers fall into NASA-themed categories called \u201cApollo,\u201d \u201cEndeavor\u201d and \u201cVoyager.\u201d\n\nBush invited donors who raised at least $27,000 in the first two weeks of his campaign to a retreat last month at his family\u2019s property in Kennebunkport, Maine. About 300 of those donors mingled with the candidate and his top strategists in what attendees said had the feel of a family reunion, complete with Jeb Bush\u2019s parents as special guests.\n\nJeb Bush\u2019s fundraising leadership team blends family stalwarts with newer names. Jack Oliver, one of the best-known fundraisers for George W. Bush, has the title of finance co-chairman. Woody Johnson, the New York Jets owner who began raising presidential money for John McCain in 2008, is his national finance chairman.\n\nBoth the campaign and super PAC emphasize their success with new donors.\n\nA spokesman for the super PAC Right to Rise, Paul Lindsay, said it has a \u201cdepth of support and diversity among our donors that spans many regions and backgrounds.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe response you hear from donors, including those who have given to previous GOP presidential candidates, is that they want to back a winner and they believe Jeb is the best candidate in the field,\u201d Lindsay said.\n\nRight to Rise can accept contributions of any size from individuals, companies and unions. The campaign is limited to contributions of $2,700 per individual donor.\n\nCrowdpac, a year-old start-up based in Menlo Park, California, built a database that includes FEC and state-level campaign finance records. The federal contribution data it includes dates to 1980. Typically, federal donors are identified if they have contributed at least $200 per election cycle. Contributor information at the state level varies.\n\nThe company also examined two other 2016 candidates with presidential campaign trailblazers in their families.\n\nDemocratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton and groups supporting her bid raised about $9 million, or 16 percent of their total receipts, from people who also donated to President Bill Clinton.\n\nRepublican contender Rand Paul is receiving candidacy-sustaining financial firepower from his father\u2019s donors: More than half the $8.9 million in pro-Rand Paul money that Crowdpac analyzed came from people who\u2019d given to former Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, who most recently ran for president in 2012.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:08:54.858+0000", "event": "articles"}

But the hill was too steep in a state President Barack Obama lost by 23 percentage points in 2012.\n\nMcConnell, like Republicans in every competitive state, relentlessly tied his opponent to the president, whose approval ratings have sagged. McConnell\u2019s allies taunted Grimes for refusing to say whether she had voted for Obama.\n\nIf Republicans gain six new seats, McConnell, 72, is positioned to become the Senate\u2019s majority leader. That would give him substantial powers to decide what legislation reaches the floor for votes, and when.\n\nHis supporters eagerly awaited election results in other states, aware that potential runoffs in Louisiana and Georgia, and possible slow vote counts in Alaska, could leave the question of Senate control unclear for some time.\n\nDemocrats privately said they hoped to limit their net losses to five seats, which would barely keep them in the majority. But even that would require them to win several races Tuesday where they were struggling.\n\nThe GOP seemed certain to pick up three seats where Democratic senators are retiring: in West Virginia, South Dakota and Montana.\n\nRepublicans were bullish in Arkansas, where freshman Rep. Tom Cotton aimed to oust two-term Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor. They felt almost as optimistic about ousting Sen. Mary Landrieu in Louisiana \u2014 although a Dec. 6 runoff seemed likely. First-term Democratic Sen. Mark Begich of Alaska was another top target.\n\nVictories in those six states would give Republicans the Senate majority, provided they don\u2019t lose any seats they now hold. Their biggest worries in that regard were in Georgia and Kansas.\n\nIn Georgia, where GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss is retiring, Democrat Michelle Nunn and Republican David Perdue were locked in a tight battle.\n\nIn Kansas, three-term Republican Sen. Pat Roberts was scrambling to fend off independent candidate Greg Orman, who had persuaded the Democrat to leave the race and help him consolidate anti-Roberts sentiment. Orman hasn\u2019t said which party he will caucus with, however, so a Roberts loss doesn\u2019t automatically endanger the GOP\u2019s chances.\n\nElsewhere, contests for Democratic-held seats in three closely divided states could prove crucial.\n\nIn North Carolina, Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan was facing state House speaker Thom Tillis. The race set records for campaign spending, with airwaves drenched in political ads. Obama carried North Carolina in 2008, and lost it in 2012.\n\nIn Colorado, first-term Democratic Sen. Mark Udall faced a strong challenge from GOP Rep. Cory Gardner. In New Hampshire, Democrats said they believed Sen. Jeanne Shaheen could hold off Republican Scott Brown, a former senator from Massachusetts.\n\nFew campaigns were as feisty and close as Iowa\u2019s, where longtime Democratic Sen.

If opponents had garnered three more votes, they would have blocked the legislation with a procedural move.\n\nWith Republicans generally in favor of the measure, the pivotal votes were cast by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and a handful of other lawmakers who support the trade measure. They used the showdown as leverage to seek a commitment that the Senate would act next month on legislation to keep the Export-Import Bank in existence. The government-backed bank backs overseas sales by U.S. companies.\n\nThe bank\u2019s legal authority expires June 30, and conservatives in the House are making a major effort to put it out of business.\n\nObama and major business groups worked in the final hours to help secure the needed Senate votes on trade. Obama made phone calls late Wednesday night to Democratic senators including Cantwell and Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat handling the trade legislation.\n\nAnd leaders of the Business Council met early Thursday with Democratic Senate leaders. They included Boeing chief executive James McNerny, a strong supporter of reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank, said Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois. Durbin, the Senate\u2019s second-ranking Democrat, said the Ex-Im was among the topics discussed.\n\nDurbin said the agreement to allow a Senate vote on the Ex-Im Bank in June was crucial to Thursday\u2019s outcome. He said he understood that the GOP-led House would allow a vote in that chamber, too. But House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he has made no such commitment.\n\nThe White House seeks the trade legislation to improve prospects for a treaty under negotiations with 11 other Pacific-Rim nations. Supporters say a deal would boost U.S. exports and create jobs for an economy still not showing full strength.\n\nLabor unions and other groups vital to Democrats strongly oppose Obama\u2019s trade agenda. They say free-trade deals cost U.S. jobs.\n\nThere were 49 Republicans and 13 Democrats who voted to advance the measure Thursday. Another 31 Democrats, two independents and five Republicans opposed.\n\nThe trade agenda is among Obama\u2019s highest second-term priorities. Support was thought to be higher in the Senate than in the House, which is awaiting trade action, so a Senate defeat would have been especially embarrassing.\n\nWyden told reporters, \u201cWe had two big issues that we basically worked through the night on.\u201d They were the Ex-Im Bank and the number of types of amendments senators can offer to the trade bill.\n\nThe politics of trade have been strange from the start. Republican lawmakers generally support expanded trade deals, but many are loath to give Obama any new victories.\n\nMost congressional Democrats and key liberal groups oppose new trade deals. But an uncertain number of House and Senate Democrats support Obama on trade, and the White House has lobbied heavily to expand that group.\n\nSenate critics are attacking the fast-track bill from many sides. Some demand crackdowns on countries that make their exports more affordable by keeping the currency artificially low.\n\nOthers insist that Congress first deal with pending expirations of a domestic surveillance program and the Export-Import Bank.\n\nSen.

{"entityId": 1029, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Republicans seeking their party\u2019s 2016 presidential nomination have the challenging task of trying to stand out among the 17 candidates in the race, and Thursday\u2019s televised debate was the first opportunity for the party to start whittling down its choices. So it\u2019s no surprise that the candidates had a vested interest in puffing up their own records as governors, senators and public figures. And some of them just got the facts wrong.\n\nSome of the claims in the Cleveland debate and how they compare with the facts:\n\nDonald Trump: \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for me, you wouldn\u2019t even be talking about illegal immigration.\u201d\n\nThe Facts: Republicans have been talking about immigration for at least 30 years, including former President George W. Bush and the Republican field in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In 2013, an immigration overhaul seeking to address illegal immigration passed the Senate with strong Republican support, although the House never took it up. And Republican debate about immigration has only intensified in the wake of President Barack Obama\u2019s sweeping executive action shielding from deportation millions of immigrants in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\u2014\n\nJeb Bush, on his goal of 4 percent economic growth: \u201cWe can do this.\u201d\n\nThe Facts: Most economists say the U.S. under any president is unlikely to grow consistently at even close to 4 percent, largely due to the difficulty of overcoming decades-long trends.\n\nCurrent forecasts put growth averaging half the rate of Bush\u2019s goal. To grow the economy faster, the country must either add more workers or increase their efficiency so their time on the job generates more income. The retirement of the baby boom generation will shrink the number of workers in the economy, making a huge increase of new employees unlikely.\n\nOnly four of the 16 presidential terms since World War II have experienced annual economic growth averaging more than 4 percent after inflation, according to research published last year by Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson.\n\n\u2014\n\nBush: \u201cYou get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something that doesn\u2019t suppress wages and kill jobs.\u201d\n\nThe Facts: According to the Labor Department, the unemployment rate was 9.9 percent in March 2010, when Obama signed the Affordable Care Act. In June of this year, it had fallen to 5.3 percent. The economy has added more than 12 million jobs since March 2010.\n\nWhile the health care law doesn\u2019t seem to have had a major impact on jobs, some lesser consequences are likely. The Congressional Budget Office projected that having government subsidized health insurance will prompt some people to leave the labor market, since they can get coverage without a job.\n\nAnd although Republicans may be able to repeal Obama\u2019s law, it\u2019s unclear if and how they would replace it. The party has yet to rally behind a plan of its own, partly because of internal ideological differences. Some Republicans say it would be the 2016 presidential nominee\u2019s job to forge a consensus.\n\n\u2014\n\nTrump: \u201cWe\u2019re giving them (Iran) $150 billion plus\u201d in sanctions relief under the nuclear deal.\n\nThe Facts: That might be an exaggeration.\n\nTreasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said Iran has $100 billion in foreign reserves that it\u2019s been unable to access. After sanctions relief, Treasury estimates that Iran will be able to freely access about half of that $100 billion. He said more than $20 billion is inaccessible because it is committed to projects with China and tens of billions of other restricted funds are in non-performing loans to Iran\u2019s energy and banking sector.\n\n\u2014\n\nChris Christie: \u201cWe brought the budget into balance with no tax increases.\u201d\n\nThe Facts: Not exactly.\n\nAs New Jersey\u2019s governor, Christie in his first term cut the earned income tax credit, which largely benefits low-income workers, from 25 percent of the federal credit to 20 percent. He surprised Democrats this summer by proposing to bring it up to 30 percent. Democrats quickly approved the change.\n\nChristie also repeatedly delayed implementing the Homestead credit program, which grants property tax relief, even as he capped property tax increases overall. He also extended the sales tax on online purchases to out-of-state retailers and pushed for higher taxes on e-cigarettes, but failed.\n\nSo while Christie indeed vetoed a number of proposed tax increases, his record isn\u2019t free of hikes in taxes or their close cousin: fees.\n\n\u2014\n\nTrump: \u201cI built a net worth of more than $10 billion.\u201d\n\nThe Facts: Trump\u2019s precise net worth has long been a moving target.\n\nDocuments filed with the Federal Election Commission put Trump\u2019s wealth at $8.7 billion. But the form requires disclosures of value ranges, not precise sums. The FEC also doesn\u2019t specify how to value real estate, leaving Trump free to assess many of his proprieties in the highest bracket \u2013 over $50 million.\n\nTrump argues many of his properties are worth even more, a claim that cannot be verified without access to his private documents. He\u2019s valued his personal brand and marketing deals at $3.3 billion.\n\nYet other assessments put his wealth at far less. Forbes Magazine valued his brand at just $125 million, and last month, Bloomberg News estimated his total worth at $2.9 billion.\n\n\u2014\n\nBush: \u201cDuring my eight years in office, 1.3 million jobs were created, and we left the state better off.\u201d\n\nFact Check: Yes, but by December 2009, 900,000 of those 1.3 million jobs had been eliminated.\n\nDuring Bush\u2019s tenure as governor, the state benefited from a huge housing bubble that then burst just as he left the governor\u2019s mansion. Home prices jumped 160 percent in Florida from 1999 through 2006 \u2013 more than double the national increase of 74 percent -according to real estate data provider Zillow.\n\nThat growth fueled a 50 percent jump in construction jobs, and the boost to home values made many Floridians feel wealthier, leading them to spend more. Home prices started to fall in 2006, Bush\u2019s last year in office.\n\n\u2014\n\nBen Carson: \u201cOur Navy is at its smallest size since 1970, our Air Force since 1940.\u201d\n\nThe Facts: Actually, the U.S. Air Force was created in 1947. Established initially as the Aeronautical Division of the U.S. Army Signal Corps in 1907, the force went through a number of iterations before becoming a full-fledged branch of the military equal to the Army and the Navy in the wake of World War II.\n\nA dearth of reliable public data makes it difficult to examine Carson\u2019s broader argument that the military\u2019s capacity is smaller now than in 1940.

(AP) \u2014 Republican presidential candidates Ted Cruz and Mike Huckabee went head-to-head for evangelical votes Sunday, telling a megachurch congregation in Georgia that God favors the United States but warning that the nation is on a perilous spiritual path because of actions like the Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in all 50 states.\n\nHuckabee, who enjoyed evangelical support on his way to winning eight states in his 2008 White House bid, called the ruling \u201cradical\u201d and \u201cillegal.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to serve notice that the Supreme Court is just the supreme of the court system that is one of the three equal branches of government,\u201d Huckabee told hundreds of members of Rock Springs Church in a rural area outside metro Atlanta. \u201cIt is not the supreme branch, and it most certainly is not the supreme being.\u201d\n\nCruz, the Texas senator, said a five-justice majority \u201cignored the text of the Constitution\u201d and said the cascade of judicial and public support for same-sex marriage threatens religious liberty in America. He said he hopes the ruling \u201cserves as a spark, to start a fire that becomes a raging inferno as the body of Christ stands up to defend the values that have built America.\u201d\n\nTheir appearance about 50 miles south of downtown Atlanta is part of the early, concerted scramble for the conservative evangelicals who remain an important bloc of the GOP presidential electorate. Christian conservatives have long held considerable influence in Iowa, which hosts the first caucus of the primary season, and in South Carolina, home of the South\u2019s first primary a few weeks later.\n\nNow, Georgia and several other Southern states get more frequent visits from presidential hopefuls ahead of the planned \u201cSEC primary,\u201d named for the Southeastern Conference of college athletics. The March 1, 2016, vote falls after the traditional first four states and ahead of the usual \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d states.\n\nHuckabee, whose 2008 wins included Iowa and Georgia, has called the Southern-dominated primary date \u201cmanna from heaven.\u201d But Cruz and others \u2014 Rick Santorum, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2014 are making hard runs for the same bloc of support.\n\nThe Sunday event was a belated Independence Day observance that also featured The Charlie Daniels Band and Jep Robertson, one of the members of the cable television \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d family. For Cruz and Huckabee, it might as well have been a county fair in Iowa, with an added opportunity to speak openly and passionately in their preferred evangelical tones.\n\nCruz told the story of an Iowa couple he said were driven out of the wedding chapel business after denying their services to two men who wanted to get married. The case, Cruz said, \u201cis emblematic of the persecution that religious liberty and believers across this country.\u201d He continued: \u201cI will always, always, always stand and defend the religious liberty of every American.\u201d\n\nHuckabee said the Independence Day observances were an opportunity to reject \u201cthe revisionists\u201d who say of the American founders: \u201cThey really were not believers.\u201d The ordained Baptist minister argued: \u201cThere is simply no other explanation \u2026 God had to bless America or we would not exist. The question is will God continue to bless America without our repentance.\u201d\n\nRev. Benny Tate, pastor of the 6,000-member Rock Springs congregation, joked about the attention. \u201cOur zip code is E-I-E-I-O,\u201d he said, \u201cand we\u2019ve got two presidential candidates. How about that?\u201d But the minister is also a serious player in Republican politics, with many Georgia politicians, and now national ones, courting his public approval, if not his explicit endorsement.\n\nTate told the assembly that Huckabee, as Arkansas governor, signed \u201ca ban on partial-birth abortion,\u201d referring to the termination of late-term pregnancies. He hailed Cruz for \u201cstanding against the Democratic Party \u2026 and even against the Republican Party.\u201d\n\nDespite the emphasis on faith, Huckabee\u2019s loudest applause came when he lauded his \u201cfair tax\u201d proposal that he said \u201cwould allow us to, once and for all, abolish the IRS.\u201d Cruz, meanwhile, drew some of his most enthusiastic reactions when he declared, \u201cI\u2019m convinced 2016 will be a referendum on repealing Obamacare,\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care law.\n\nA few minutes earlier, the assembly passed offering plates for the church\u2019s clinics, which Tate said provide \u201cfree health care\u201d to residents in dozens of surrounding counties.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Dave Urbanski (@DaveVUrbanski) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:09:19.086+0000", "event": "articles"}

It had delayed a decision until after it received the first installment from the bailout and made a debt repayment to the European Central Bank, both of which it did Thursday.\n\n\u201cThe certainty is that the need for elections has arisen,\u201d Energy and Environment Minister Panos Skourletis said on state television earlier Thursday.\n\nHe said there are two reasons for snap polls, which would come just nine months after the government came to power.\n\nThe first is that dozens of Tsipras\u2019 governing left-wing Syriza party lawmakers voted against the government on the bailout deal. Tsipras relies solely on opposition support to pass legislation in parliament. The government \u201chas lost its majority (in parliament) \u2013 one can\u2019t avoid this,\u201d Skourletis said.\n\nThe other reason was that Syriza is part of a government that needs to implement a program that is different to that which it was elected for.\n\nTsipras will also be calculating that a better election result if polls are held before the steep tax hikes and spending cuts in the bailout are felt by the electorate.\n\nTsipras and his coalition government made a major U-turn in policy by accepting stringent budget austerity conditions that creditors had demanded in exchange for the 86 billion euro, three-year bailout program. Tsipras and his radical left Syriza party came to power in January promising to scrap such spending cuts and tax hikes.\n\nHe has since said that accepting the terms was the only way to ensure his country remains in the eurozone, which opinion polls have shown the vast majority of his population wants.\n\nOpinion polls have shown Tsipras to continue enjoying popular support and to be far ahead of his opposition rivals, although no polls have been published since the bailout deal was finalized.\n\nA new mandate would allow him to move away from the hardliners in his party, some of whom have openly advocated leaving the euro and returning to the drachma. The hardliners, including prominent members such as former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and possibly the flamboyant former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, are likely to split from Syriza.\n\nSome analysts took the reports of early elections as an indication that Greece will struggle to implement its bailout.\n\n\u201cGiven its anti-austerity roots, the remaining Syriza party will still struggle to implement the demanding bailout conditions, especially in the likely event that Greece sinks further into recession,\u201d said Jennifer McKeown, senior European economist at Capital Economics. \u201cAnd major reforms seem unlikely to be passed in the period running up to the election.\u201d\n\nHowever, initial reaction from European authorities appeared cautiously optimistic. Martin Selmayr, head of the cabinet of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, tweeted that quick elections \u201ccan be a way to broaden support for (the bailout) stability support program.\u201d\n\nThe political uncertainty took its toll on the market, with the Athens Stock Exchange closing 3.5 percent.\n\n\u201cThe Greek stock market is coming into a new circle of uncertainty while we are waiting for new elections to be announced,\u201d said analyst Evangelos Sioutis, head of equities at Guardian Trust Securities. \u201cFor the stock markets it is a factor of uncertainty.\u201d\n\nGreek banking is still restricted under capital controls imposed in late June to stem a bank run sparked after Tsipras called a referendum on creditor proposals for reforms following a breakdown in bailout negotiations. There are weekly limits on cash withdrawals and Greeks can only transfer up to 500 euros abroad per month. Companies have faced problems paying suppliers abroad, with all international payments requiring a laborious process of approval by a special finance ministry committee.\n\n\u201cGreece has capital controls, the economy is choking, and we will now have uncertainty from elections, so you understand that it has been a difficult month,\u201d Sioutis said.\n\nGreece received the first 13 billion euros ($14.5 billion) from its new bailout package on Thursday, allowing it to repay its ECB debt and avoid a messy default.\n\nGreece could not have afforded the debt repayment, which was confirmed by the debt management agency, without the rescue funds from 18 other European nations that share the euro currency. Missing the payment would have raised new questions about the country\u2019s ability to remain in the euro.\n\nEuropean bailout fund supervisors approved the release of the first batch of loans on Wednesday evening, with 12 billion euros earmarked for repaying debts and the remainder for settling arrears to public sector suppliers.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:09:19.900+0000", "event": "articles"}

Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) Oct. 31, 2013, said the president\u2019s \u201cproblems\u201d were that he repeatedly told Americans if they had a health insurance policy they liked, they wouldn\u2019t need to buy a new one.\n\nAs millions of otherwise satisfied consumers later found out, that wasn\u2019t entirely true. Matthews acknowledged:\n\n\u201cNow they\u2019re being told by their insurance companies that those policies aren\u2019t going to exist anymore. What do you think was wrong \u2013 if you did think anything was wrong \u2013 in the way the president sold the idea that you\u2019d be held harmless, you\u2019d be left alone with no paperwork or whatever if you had a good policy?\u201d\n\nGruber responded by saying that the president should have made a somewhat \u201cvaguer\u201d statement about Americans with health insurance being able to keep their health insurance. He also pointed out that the number of people the president was referring to when he repeatedly made that promise \u2013 \u201cif you like your health insurance plan you can keep your health insurance plan\u201d \u2013 was only about 5 to 6 percent of Americans who bought their insurance on the individual market and not through their employer or the government.\n\nThose several percent who were forced to buy new plans, Gruber said, would be able to replicate the plan they had before with a similar plan, adding that the name of the plan might be different or the deductible could change a little bit, but overall, those people would be able to purchase essentially the same plans as the ones they had before.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very small slice of Americans who will literally have to change their insurance plan and that\u2019s largely because they\u2019re in crappy insurance that doesn\u2019t really protect them from real financial risk,\u201d Gruber continued, \u201cso that\u2019s why we\u2019re asking them to go buy real insurance.\u201d\n\nThose comments surfaced just days after another explosive video was uncovered. In that clip, Gruber described the process by which Obamacare was passed. The \u201clack of transparency\u201d in the way the law was written and marketed, Gruber claimed, was a huge \u201cpolitical advantage\u201d for the Democrats that could have made all the difference in the health care debate.\n\n\u201cCall it the stupidity of the American voter or whatever, but basically that was really really critical for the thing to pass,\u201d he said.\n\nGruber went on to say it was better for the American people to be saddled with a law they didn\u2019t understand than to understand the law and rally against it: \u201cLook, I wish \u2026 we could make it all transparent, but I\u2019d rather have this law than not,\u201d he concluded.\n\nFollow Jon Street (@JonStreet) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:09:34.310+0000", "event": "articles"}
{"entityId": 1042, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "When she steps into her new role as senior adviser to President Barack Obama, Shailagh Murray will become the latest in a long line of former journalists who have left their Fourth Estate roles to go work for the White House.\n\nMurray, a former Washington Post and Wall Street journal reporter, first joined the Obama administration as Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s communications director in 2011. On Tuesday, she was named as the replacement for longtime Obama hand Dan Pfeiffer, who departed the West Wing earlier this month.\n\nSome 30 journalists have left their profession to go work in the Obama administration or on one of his presidential campaigns, according to the most recent tally by the Media Research Center, a conservative media watchdog group. One of the most visible jumps was by Jay Carney, a former Time reporter who went to work as Biden\u2019s communications director \u2014 Murray\u2019s old post \u2014 before ending up as White House press secretary.\n\nWhile the number of journalists who have gone from covering President Barack Obama to working for him has garnered notice over the years, it\u2019s not a brand-new phenomenon.\n\n\u201cIt was much more common in the very earlier times,\u201d said George Condon, White House correspondent for the National Journal and who\u2019s working on a history of the White House press corps. \u201cBut it has always happened.\u201d\n\nA century ago, President Woodrow Wilson was so pleased with the reporting of Washington Post reporter Raymond W. Pullman that he appointed him District of Columbia police chief. Wilson appointed other journalists he liked to be D.C. commissioners, well before District home rule.\n\n\u201cIt has always happened.\u201d Share:\n\nIt\u2019s also not unique to Democrats: George W. Bush press secretary Tony Snow ping-ponged between journalism and politics several times, starting his career as a journalist before going to work in the George H.W. Bush administration, then becoming the first host of \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in the 1990s, then returning to the White House to serve as press secretary in 2006.\n\nTop George W. Bush adviser Karen Hughes was a Texas TV reporter in the 1970s and early 1980s before leaving the news business to join the Reagan-Bush re-election campaign. Hughes joined up with George W. Bush first on his Texas gubernatorial campaign in 1994, then became a top State Department and counselor to him during his White House tenure.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t an immediate journalist-to-White House transition for Hughes, just as it wasn\u2019t for David Axelrod, a former Chicago Tribune reporter who toiled in politics for some time before going to work for Obama.\n\nCondon recalled that as a young reporter for the San Diego Union newspaper, editor Jerry Warren went to work for Richard Nixon as White House deputy press secretary before going back to journalism in 1975 after Watergate. Commentator Pat Buchanan left his job at the St. Louis Globe-Democrat to work as a speechwriter for Nixon and ended up a senior adviser to Nixon, Ford and Ronald Reagan.\n\nIn Bill Clinton administration, former U.S. News and World Report reporter Don Baer became White House communications director, and Strobe Talbott, a former Time editor, served as a deputy secretary of state.\n\nTwo legendary journalists held roles in Democratic administrations, Condon noted: CBS broadcaster Edward R. Murrow and NBC newsman John Chancellor. Murrow went to work for the John F. Kennedy administration to run the United States Information Agency, which later became Voice of America. Chancellor ran Voice of America under Lyndon Johnson.\n\nIt was previously common for all press secretaries to come from the ranks of the press, Condon said, as 12 of the first 13 White House press secretaries were all once reporters. After the tumult of Watergate, just four of the next 18 press secretaries were former reporters.\n\nWhile some would point to the new uptick in journalists going to work for the Obama administration as evidence of a certain coziness, Condon said he thinks it has more to do with economics.\n\n\u201cThe number was up a little when Obama came in, but that\u2019s because it was such a time of turmoil in journalism,\u201d Condon said. \u201cFor newspapers, there were a lot of reporters out of work. So I\u2019m not surprised it\u2019s up under Obama.\u201d\n\nBut Brent Baker, vice president for research and publications at the Media Research Center, said he\u2019s been tracking the \u201crevolving door\u201d of journalists going into government for the last three decades and said the number of prominent journalists joining Democratic administrations or campaigns has been consistently higher than those joining Republican administrations or campaigns.\n\n\u201cThe claim that this occurs equally with Democratic and Republican administrations is bogus,\u201d Baker told TheBlaze. \u201cTony Snow is the exception, and he never worked for a major mainstream media outlet, unlike Jay Carney.\u201d\n\nBaker has monitored TV networks, major news magazines and newspapers with a national reach and says the numbers are clear.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been tracking the revolving door since the late Reagan years and the ratio is a good 3\u2013 or 4\u2013to\u20131 toward journalists going to work for Democratic administrations and campaigns over any back-and-forth between journalism and Republican administrations,\u201d Baker said. \u201cAs soon as Clinton came into office, a flood of journalists joined his team, to say nothing of his operatives who became major media figures [like ABC News anchor] George Stephanopoulos. And it happened again as soon as the Obama transition began in late 2008. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll soon see some Obama officials taking prominent journalism positions.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe claim that this occurs equally with Democratic and Republican administrations is bogus.\u201d Share:\n\nCondon said he\u2019s less concerned about journalists leaving the news business for politics than the notion of how easy it is to return to journalism afterward.\n\n\u201cYou have to be on guard against the revolving door of coming and going,\u201d Condon said. \u201cThe bigger problem is leaving and coming back to journalism and acting like nothing happened. It should be clear in your coverage that you are not carrying any baggage.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a history that predates Stephanopoulos\u2019 turn from top Clinton aide to \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cThis Week\u201d host. Pierre Salinger, who served as John F. Kennedy\u2019s press secretary, also went to work as an ABC News correspondent. Both had to prove their credentials, Condon said.\n\nOthers see little problem with the overlap between working for politicians and working in the media.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances where journalists have run for office and politicians have become writers,\u201d said Todd Gitlin, a professor at Columbia University\u2019s Graduate School of Journalism. \u201cIn my mind, there is no hard and fast line that says writers can\u2019t have views of the world they experience. There\u2019s nothing scandalous about it.\u201d\n\nGitlin said that as long as there is no corruption involved, such as a tradeoff for positive coverage, there is nothing wrong with a politician hiring a journalist as their spokesman. His bigger concern is journalists not covering politicians honestly while they are journalists.\n\nHe referred to the late NBC \u201cMeet the Press\u201d host Tim Russert, who was once chief of staff to former New York Democratic Sen. Daniel Moynihan, and who was often regarded as tough interviewer. Gitlin disagrees, noting that he made his criticism when Russert was alive.\n\n\u201cI would say he would bend over backwards to be cozy with politicians,\u201d Gitlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not because I cared what was on his resume. It\u2019s because I cared about him being a sober, competent and instructive journalist.\u201d\n\nRegardless of where or when they work, Gitlin said, \u201cwe still have to be vigilant about anything said by journalist and presidents.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:09:35.271+0000", "event": "articles"}

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday became the second nationally recognized Republican to announce he\u2019s running for the White House in 2016.\n\n\u201cI have a message, a message that is loud and clear and does not mince words. We have come to take our country back,\u201d he said to cheers from supporters and family members in his announcement speech in Kentucky. \u201dThe Washington machine that gobbles up our freedoms and invades every nook and cranny of our lives must be stopped.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo rescue a great country now adrift, join me, as together we seek a new vision for America,\u201d he said. \u201dToday, I announce with God\u2019s help, with the help of liberty lovers everywhere, that I am putting myself forward as a candidate for president of the United States of America.\u201d\n\nPaul is a favorite among libertarians and constitutionalists who want to see power devolved from Washington, D.C., and given back to the states. His announcement speech noted his well-known devotion to the Constitution, a guide for limited government that he believes has been ignored for the last several years.\n\n\u201cWe need to boldly proclaim our vision for America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to go boldly forth under the banner of liberty that clutches the Constitution in one hand, and the Bill of Rights in the other.\u201d\n\nPaul cited the massive national debt and bloated annual budget deficits as signs of government run amok, and said both parties can be blamed for this outcome. He said a constitutional amendment would be needed to fix that problem.\n\n\u201cBig government and debt doubled under a Republican administration, and it\u2019s now tripling under Barack Obama\u2019s watch,\u201d he said. \u201cPresident Obama is on course to add more debt than all of the previous presidents combined.\u201d\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t the country just survive on $3 trillion? I propose we do something extraordinary \u2014 let\u2019s just spend what comes in,\u201d he added.\n\nPaul also hit on well-known issues of his such as such as school choice, limiting foreign aid and ending warrantless surveillance of innocent Americans by the National Security Agency as a way of gathering intelligence. \u201dAs president, on day one, I will immediately end this unconstitutional surveillance,\u201d he said.\n\nFor many Republicans, Paul\u2019s weakness is his opposition to an interventionist foreign affairs stance \u2014 that position of his has put him at odds with Republicans like Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and others who seek a much more aggressive role in fighting emerging threats. But on this issue, Paul made it clear that he will not take a back seat on the idea of defending America.\n\n\u201cThe enemy is radical Islam, you can\u2019t get around it,\u201d he said, a nod to the Obama administration\u2019s aversion to using that term. \u201cAnd not only will I name the enemy, I will do whatever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, he warned that conservatives should be wary of overusing the military for nation-building, especially given the skepticism most conservatives have about the ability of the government to do anything right. \u201dConservatives should not succumb, though, to the notion that a government inept at home will somehow succeed in building nations abroad,\u201d he said.\n\nPaul joined with other Republicans who have said Congress needs to approve any Iran nuclear deal that\u2019s finalized under the Obama administration. He also said he would \u201doppose any deal that does not end Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions and will have strong verification measures.\u201d\n\nPaul has gone out of his his way to seek common ground with Democrats, including by favoring reduced prison sentences for minor drug violations. He said last year that U.S. prisons are too filled with \u201cblack and brown kids,\u201d and today, he said the U.S. should repeal any law that disproportionately puts more minorities in jail.\n\nSchool choice is another issue he hopes to use to bring minority voters to his cause. \u201dWe need to stop limiting kids in poor neighborhoods to failing public schools, and offer them school choice,\u201d he said.\n\nIn March, Paul said his effort to win over traditional Democratic voters is a key difference between himself and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), the only other major Republican figure who has declared himself a candidate for 2016.\n\n\u201cI guess what makes us different is probably our approaches to how we would make the party bigger,\u201d Paul said. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that you should stand on principle and be true to your principles, but I also think that we should take those principles and try to bring in new people.\u201d\n\nBoth candidates, however, agree that the GOP needs to nominate a clear-cut conservative instead of what Cruz calls a candidate of the \u201csquishy\u201d middle.\n\n\u201cIf we nominate a candidate who is simply Democrat-lite, what\u2019s the point?\u201d Paul asked today. \u201cWhy bother?\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:09:50.072+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1067, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 President Barack Obama said Saturday that the surge of immigrant children entering the U.S. illegally changed the politics surrounding the immigration issue and led him to put off a pledge to use executive action that could have shielded millions of people from deportation.\n\nImmigration reform advocates criticized Obama after White House officials said that the president would not act at summer\u2019s end as he promised in June but would take up the matter after the midterm elections in November. In an interview taped for NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Obama rejected the charge that the delay was meant to protect Democratic candidates worried that his actions would hurt their prospects in tough Senate races.\n\nBy Obama\u2019s own calculations, politics did play a role in his decision. In his remarks to NBC, which were to be aired on Sunday, he said a partisan fight in July over how to address an influx of unaccompanied minors at the border had created the impression that there was an immigration crisis and thus a volatile climate for taking the measures he had promised to take.\n\n\u201cThe truth of the matter is \u2014 is that the politics did shift midsummer because of that problem,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to spend some time, even as we\u2019re getting all our ducks in a row for the executive action, I also want to make sure that the public understands why we\u2019re doing this, why it\u2019s the right thing for the American people, why it\u2019s the right thing for the American economy.\u201d\n\nReflecting the passion behind the threat of deportations, immigration advocacy groups that have criticized Republicans for not passing an immigration overhaul instantly turned their anger on Obama.\n\nCristina Jimenez, managing director of United We Dream, said the decision was \u201canother slap to the face of the Latino and immigrant community.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere we have demanded leadership and courage from both Democrats and the president, we\u2019ve received nothing but broken promises and a lack of political backbone,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cWe are bitterly disappointed in the president and we are bitterly disappointed in the Senate Democrats,\u201d said Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice. \u201cWe advocates didn\u2019t make the reform promise; we just made the mistake of believing it. The president and Senate Democrats have chosen politics over people, the status quo over solving real problems.\u201d\n\nTwo White House officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted by name, said Obama made the decision to delay taking action as he returned Friday to Washington from a NATO summit in Wales. He called a few allies from Air Force One to inform them of his decision, the officials said, and made more calls from the White House on Saturday.\n\nObama went to the White House Rose Garden on June 30 to angrily declare that House Speaker John Boehner had informed him that the Republican-controlled House would not be taking up any measures to overhaul the immigration system. As a result, he said, he had directed Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Attorney General Eric Holder to give him recommendations for executive action by the end of summer. Obama also pledged to \u201cadopt those recommendations without further delay.\u201d\n\nBy delaying, the White House weighed the benefits of acting now and running the risk of immigration getting blamed for any Democratic losses, especially in the Senate where Democratic control hangs in the balance. Among those considered most at risk were Democratic Sens. Mark Pryor of Arkansas, Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Kay Hagan of North Carolina.\n\n\u201cWashington politics at its worst.\u201d Share:\n\nObama advisers were not convinced that any presidential action would affect the elections. But the officials said the discussions around timing grew more pronounced within the past few weeks.\n\nUltimately, the advisers drew a lesson from 1994 when Democratic losses were blamed on votes for gun-control legislation, undermining any interest in passing future gun measures.\n\nWhite House officials said aides realized that if Obama\u2019s immigration action was deemed responsible for Democratic losses this year, it could hurt any attempt to pass a broad overhaul later on.\n\nRepublican leaders in Congress criticized the president, calling his decision a cynical ploy.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Obama\u2019s move amounted to \u201cWashington politics at its worst.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s so cynical about today\u2019s immigration announcement is that the president isn\u2019t saying he\u2019ll follow the law, he\u2019s just saying he\u2019ll go around the law once it\u2019s too late for Americans to hold his party accountable in the November elections,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cThis is clearly not decision-making designed around the best policy.\u201d\n\nBoehner, R-Ohio, in a statement on Saturday, said the decision to delay, rather than abandon, the idea of executive action on immigration \u201csmacks of raw politics.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny unilateral action will only further strain the bonds of trust between the White House and the people they are supposed to serve,\u201d Boehner said.\n\nPartisan fighting erupted recently over how to address the increased flow of unaccompanied minors from Central America at the U.S. border with Mexico. The officials said the White House had not envisioned such a battle when Obama made his pledge in June.\n\nSince then, the number of minors caught alone illegally crossing the Mexican border into the United States has been declining. That decrease and Congress\u2019 absence from Washington during August has taken attention away from the border for now.\n\nObama said that without legislation from Congress, he would take steps to increase border security, upgrade the processing of border crossers and encourage legal immigration. He also said he would offer immigrants who have been illegally in the United States for some time a way to become legal residents, pay taxes, pay a fine and learn English.\n\nAssociated Press writers Erica Werner and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:10:12.876+0000", "event": "articles"}

Still, his blunt description of his own emotional frailty on Thursday marked the strongest indication yet that he may be leaning against running for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSince his son\u2019s death, Biden has frequently peppered his speeches with references to Beau and the impressive resume he developed in his 46 years. Yet Biden went further in the interview, describing in detail conversations he had with Beau in the months before his death at a military hospital.\n\n\u201cHe said, `Dad, sit down, I want to talk to you.\u2019 He said, `Dad, I know how much you love me,\u2019\u201d Biden recalled. \u201cPromise me you\u2019ll be all right, because no matter what happens, I\u2019m going to be all right.\u201d\n\nIf Biden seemed unusually willing to bare his soul, it may have been due to his host. Colbert, the longtime Comedy Central star who this week took over David Letterman\u2019s former role, lost his father and two brothers in a plane crash as a child. Biden invoked Colbert\u2019s losses to make a point about how \u201cthere are so many other people going through this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel self-conscious talking about it,\u201d Biden said, looking down solemnly and occasionally wringing his hands.\n\nDecades ago, at the start of his political career, Biden lost his wife and infant daughter in a car crash that also injured Beau and his other son, Hunter. Asked by Colbert how he perseveres, Biden cited his Catholic faith \u2014 revealing how he relies on going to mass and saying the rosary for perspective and comfort \u2014 and his determination to simply keep moving.\n\n\u201cWhat my faith has done, it sort of takes everything about my life \u2026 all the good things that have happened have happened around the culture of my religion and the theology of my religion and I don\u2019t know how to explain it more than that. It\u2019s just a place you can go,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden went on to say that \u201cif I didn\u2019t just get up,\u201d he\u2019d feel like he was letting down his son, his parents and his family.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to get up,\u201d he said.\n\nWatch the second part of the interview, which starts with the audience chanting \u201cJoe! Joe! Joe!\u201d:\n\nFor his part, Colbert was unabashed in his support for a Biden campaign, praising him effusively for showing Americans \u201cthe real Joe Biden\u201d and adding, \u201cI think we\u2019d all be very happy if you did run.\u201d Biden attributed his current star status in the Democratic Party to the fact that he never felt compelled to modulate what he says.\n\n\u201cIf you can\u2019t state why you want the job, then there\u2019s a lot more lucrative opportunities other places,\u201d he said.\n\nBiden\u2019s public meditation on the 2016 race capped a hectic day of speeches and events in New York, where he focused on two issues that have been central to his political career for decades: workers\u2019 rights and violence against women. He spent part of the day at a fundraiser for Senate Democrats.\n\nThe vice president once set an end-of-summer deadline to decide whether to run, but that outlook was reshuffled after his son, the former Delaware attorney general, died. In early August, Biden let it be known that he was actively considering a run. More recently, Biden\u2019s aides have said any announcement would likely slip into late September or early October, or possibly even later.\n\nThe intense interest stirred up by the prospect of Biden running campaign has essentially frozen the Democratic primary campaign, as Hillary Rodham Clinton and the other candidates wait to see whether they\u2019ll face another formidable contender. Recent national polls have suggested Biden could be competitive against the Republican candidates, and that he\u2019s more popular within his own party than Clinton in key primary states.\n\nFunny or not, the late-night appearance put Biden on the same stage to which 2016 presidential candidates have been flocking. Since Colbert\u2019s debut this week, he\u2019s already snagged an interview with GOP contender Jeb Bush and booked future appearances with candidates Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Clinton will try out her comedy chops next week on NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\u201d\n\n\u2014\n\nThis story has been updated to correct a typo in the headline.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:10:57.897+0000", "event": "articles"}

For those who are now wondering whether or not they should apply, we are going to refer those questions to the Department of Homeland Security that has already begun the planning process. And we will be prepared to implement this fully as soon as the legal issues get resolved.\u201d\n\nObama added: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to disregard this federal court ruling. The law is the law in this country, and we take things a step at a time.\u201d\n\n1. What the Administration Won\u2019t Do\n\nThe administration will continue to act on some aspects of the executive actions issued last year, said Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. That includes directing federal law enforcement not to deport certain individuals. However, deferred action for parents of illegal immigrants and expanded deferred action for those brought to the country by their parents will not move forward.\n\n\u201cLast night\u2019s district court decision, while it prevents for the moment the administration from moving forward, accepting applications for expanded DACA and the DAPA program, the enforcement priority that the president announced on Nov. 20 and implemented on Jan. 5 remain in place,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz told reporters in a conference call Tuesday. \u201cThis regime of focusing our enforcement resources where they are going to have the highest priority continues to move forward.\u201d\n\nIn 2012, Obama took executive action for Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals (DACA), for illegal immigrants no older than 31 or before January 2007. In November, he expanded that to included anyone who was in the United States before 2010. Obama further shielded parents of legal residents from deportation under Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA).\n\n\u201cI would not that the existing DACA program, the one that started in 2012, remains in place and was not effected by the judicial decision,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cSo we will continue to accept application for that program and continue to implement it.\u201d\n\n2. What Continues?\n\n\u201cI would note that the existing DACA program, the one that started in 2012, remains in place and was not effected by the judicial decision,\u201d Munoz added. \u201cSo we will continue to accept application for that program and continue to implement it.\u201d\n\n3. Informing Illegals\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security will work to inform illegal immigrants of the differences between the programs, to avoid confusion as to what programs are no longer available and what programs are, Munoz said.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day, the agency will do a good job of providing information to people,\u201d Munoz said. \u201cAdvocacy organization will do a good job in providing information to people, and service organizations will do a good job providing information to people. At the end of the day, we expect to prevail legally and we expect this will be a successful process.\u201d\n\n4. Court Strategy\n\nThe Obama administration is confident it will win in its appeal of U.S. district judge\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cThis is not the first district court level ruling we\u2019ve seen on the president\u2019s executive actions,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest said. \u201cI think those who are veteran court watchers were not very surprised by this ruling.

{"entityId": 1120, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Following the announcement this week of early elections, several Israeli media outlets have begun examining how the Obama administration might try to influence Israeli voters in the hopes of replacing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with whom the administration has had a combative relationship.\n\nThe left-wing newspaper Haaretz reported Thursday that while the White House for weeks has been considering taking harsher steps beyond public denouncements against Israeli construction in the West Bank and east Jerusalem, it now faces the dilemma of first making sure the move won\u2019t strengthen Netanyahu in advance of the March vote.\n\n\u201cOne of the aspects of this that is being looked into by the U.S. government is whether American action against the settlements at this point would weaken Netanyahu in Israeli public opinion, or do just the opposite, by portraying him as one who doesn\u2019t cave in to international pressure,\u201d Haaretz reported.\n\nWhen asked about the internal policy debate over new measures against settlements, senior U.S. officials that Haaretz approached \u201cdid not deny this, but refused to disclose more details,\u201d while National Security Council spokeswoman Bernadette Meehan had no comment to the paper.\n\nEven as it may reportedly be debating how its Middle East policy might influence Israeli voters, publicly the administration is staying out of Israeli politics.\n\n\u201cI simply don\u2019t comment on the internal politics of any country, and certainly not of a change in personnel within the government of Israel,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Tuesday after Netanyahu fired two ministers and called for new elections. \u201cIsrael is our partner and ally and friend, and we will continue to support Israel in the same ways that we have previously.\u201d\n\nKerry said he hoped whatever government emerges is one \u201cthat can negotiate and move towards resolving the differences between Israelis and Palestinians, and obviously, the differences in the region,\u201d Kerry said.\n\nIn an article headlined \u201cOutside forces already at work on influencing outcome of elections,\u201d the conservative Jerusalem Post newspaper wrote following Kerry\u2019s remarks, \u201cHis comments, and the bulk of comments coming from Washington over the next few months regarding Netanyahu, need now to be seen within the context of trying to influence the Israeli electorate.\u201d\n\nThe Jerusalem Post noted the example that just one week before the last Israeli elections in 2013, Bloomberg writer Jeffrey Goldberg quoted President Barack Obama saying privately that, \u201cIsrael doesn\u2019t know what its own best interests are,\u201d a clear dig at Netanyahu.\n\nThe assertion that the U.S. doesn\u2019t try to influence Israeli elections \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 \u201cclearly isn\u2019t true\u201d according to Aaron David Miller who was a senior State Department official in both Democratic and Republican administrations, handling the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.\n\n\u201cWe always tried to influence the elections in Israel, but we never succeeded,\u201d Miller told the Israeli news site Ynet.\n\n\u201cWe think we understand Israeli politics, but we don\u2019t know how to do it well,\u201d Miller said, adding, \u201cIt always worked against us.\u201d\n\nMiller warned the Obama administration of the potential danger in trying to influence Israeli voters this time around, recalling a failed effort in 1996.\n\n\u201cObama is not popular in the country, in comparison with Clinton who was a president who was loved in Israel and created unprecedented relationships with the leaders and the Israeli public. We wanted to see [then Labor Party leader Shimon] Peres elected and it did not happen. If Obama and Kerry will try to influence \u2013 it would be a mistake,\u201d Miller told Ynet.\n\nIn an essay published Tuesday in Foreign Policy, Miller wrote that the alternative to Netanyahu might be even worse in the view of the U.S. administration.\n\n\u201cI can only imagine what thoughts of a new Israeli prime minister are now dancing in U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s and Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s heads. And they may well believe that an ABB theme \u2014 Anyone But Bibi \u2014 is worth pursuing. But America\u2019s great leaders should tread very carefully here before they start interfering in Israel\u2019s politics,\u201d Miller wrote. \u201cThey may well get a new prime minister, but it may not be the one they want.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s because of the rising popularity of Naftali Bennett, leader of the religious, pro-settlement Jewish Home party who is politically to the right of Netanyahu.\n\nBased on a new poll, Israelis may not be so quick to fall in line with Obama administration preferences.\n\nA poll released Tuesday by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies showed that the percentage of Israelis who believe Obama has a \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d view of Israel has fallen sharply over the past two years.\n\nThe Jerusalem Post reported that 37 percent of Israelis interviewed believe Obama has a \u201cpositive\u201d position toward Israel, 37 percent said he had a \u201cnegative\u201d attitude toward the country, and 24 percent believe he is \u201cneutral.\u201d In 2012, 51 percent told the research organization that Obama had a positive attitude toward Israel.\n\nOn another question, 52 percent of those surveyed said they believe Obama\u2019s policy on the Israel-Palestinian conflict has been \u201cbad,\u201d 50 percent did not like his Iran policy, and 47 percent disapproved of his handling of the Islamic State group, the Jerusalem Post reported.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:11:24.114+0000", "event": "articles"}

But Klain has been criticized for keeping a low profile and not talking to the media or Congress.\n\nThe Obama administration has asked Congress for $6.2 billion in additional funding to fight Ebola.\n\nObama told members of Congress they should act now to support the request for emergency funding to combat Ebola abroad and increase our preparedness at home, a White House press release describing the meeting said.\n\n2. Boehner\u2019s Warning on Immigration\n\nOne day after the election, Obama said he would take executive action by the end of the year that would potentially bestow legal status on millions of illegal immigrants.\n\nOn Friday, Obama repeated his plan to members \u201cin light of the House\u2019s inability to pass a comprehensive bill,\u201d as the White House news release put it.\n\nBoehner repeated to Obama what he has been telling the press in recent days.\n\n\u201cThe speaker warned that unilateral action by the president on executive amnesty will erase any chances of doing immigration reform and will also make it harder for Congress and the White House to work together successfully on other areas where there might otherwise be common ground,\u201d according to a press release from the speaker\u2019s office about the meeting.\n\n3. Fighting the Islamic State\n\nDefense Secretary Chuck Hagel urged Congress to provide the $5.6 billion in additional resources to combat the Islamic State forces in Syrian and Iraq.\n\nDuring the meeting, Boehner asked Obama to send Congress a new Authorization for Use of Military Force proposal.\n\nThe White House has said the 2001 authorization gave the administration legal authority to go into Iraq and battle the Islamic State, but is nevertheless seeking Congress\u2019s stamp of approval on another resolution.\n\n4. More Than 40 Bills\n\nDuring the lunch meeting, Boehner told Obama that the House already passed more than 40 bills that were blocked by the Democratic Senate. With a new majority coming to the Senate in January, some of those House bills would be a good place to start in making progress, Boehner said.\n\nThe speaker\u2019s office said these bills include the approval of the Keystone pipeline, restoring the 40-hour workweek, and supporting charter schools.\n\n5. What\u2019s for Lunch?\n\nAccording to the White House, the lunch menu was:\n\nBibb Lettuce, Frisee and Endive, Heirloom Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Toasted Shallot Dressing, Herb Crusted Sea Bass, Tomato-Lemon Confit Grilled Vegetables, Pumpkin Tart, Vanilla Whipped Cream and Candied Ginger.\n\n\u2013", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:11:24.974+0000", "event": "articles"}

After President Reuven Rivlin taps the leader to form a government, he has 28 days plus a possible extension of two weeks to present his coalition.\n\nThe nearly completed official paper ballot count showed Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party securing 29 or 30 seats in contrast with 24 for the left-wing Zionist Union.\n\nSmaller parties that are Netanyahu\u2019s natural ideological partners also had a good enough showing to allow the incumbent prime minister to form a solid right-wing coalition along with the help of at least one centrist party focused on tackling the severe economic challenges of Israel\u2019s middle class.\n\nThe coalition-building process usually involves those smaller parties that Netanyahu needs putting forth exorbitant demands for ministerial and parliamentary positions. Netanyahu will then have to haggle them down to fall in line with the demands of the other coalition partners as well as members of his own Likud. All the while he will need to make certain coalition partners remain committed to the ideological outlines guiding the government.\n\nThe last government provided a good example of how ideological differences can bring down a coalition. Though elected for four years, the last multi-party government fell apart after only two years.\n\nStill, while Obama did not immediately congratulate Netanyahu, at least three other leaders did, including Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper, British Prime Minister David Cameron and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Cruz said he asked McConnell the question during a private Senate Republican lunch.\n\n\u201cI stood up and I asked the majority leader very directly, what was the deal that was just cut on TPA and was there a deal for the Export-Import Bank? It was a direct question. I asked the majority leader in front of all the Republican senators. The majority leader was visibly angry with me that I would ask such a question, and the majority leader looked at me and said, \u2018There is no deal, there is no deal, there is no deal,\u2019\u201d Cruz said. \u201cLike St. Peter he repeated it three times.\u201d\n\nCruz said his Senate staff was more skeptical.\n\n\u201cMy staff told me, \u2018He\u2019s lying to you, we\u2019ve been around here for a long time.

Instead we need to find ways to unite America,\u201d Walker said. \u201cOne of the things we can start with is recognizing the overwhelming majority of people in law enforcement are doing the job they were asked to do every day under difficult circumstances. They are risking their lives to keep our families and us safe. We need to start with the premise that they need to be applauded. They need to be protected.

He said the Ferguson Police Department has been \u201coppressive and abusive\u201d to blacks following a Justice Department finding that the department had a pattern of racial bias and used excessive force. Obama has said that monitoring police is one way to prevent violent crime and called the situation in Baltimore with the death of Freddie Gray an example of a \u201cslow-rolling crisis\u201d between police and minority communities.\n\nFor his part, Walker signed legislation in Wisconsin requiring an independent investigation outside the department whenever someone dies in police custody.\n\n\u201cIn my state, I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m the first governor \u2014 I believe the only governor right now in the nation \u2014 that requires an independent investigation anytime there is a death of a suspect in police custody,\u201d Walker said. \u201cI think that is not only a good law not only for the public as a whole, it\u2019s a good law for law enforcement. If something were to happen, it allows an independent review to show that police officer or that deputy or whoever it might be followed the proper process, and the vast, vast majority are going to be shown to have done exactly what they were shown to do in a difficult situation. In the rare instance in which they are not, there will be an independent review that will show that and that person will be held accountable.\u201d\n\nWalker continued: \u201cThe problem is, there is a building problem that just because there are a couple people who have done something that wasn\u2019t right, that somehow that is a reflection of everyone.

He later said he was suffering from back problems during his first White House run and admitted he wasn\u2019t fully prepared, but said that\u2019s not the case this time.\n\nPerry became governor of Texas in December 2000 when George W. Bush vacated the position after winning the presidential election. He went on to win three consecutive terms in his own right. For his third, he defeated Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson by a wide margin in what was one of the most closely watched primaries of 2010.\n\nLast year, while he was still governor, Perry was indicted on felony charges for abuse of power and coercion of a public servant in a case widely viewed as political. The charges alleged Perry abused his power when he vetoed state funding for the Travis County Public Integrity Unit after Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg refused to resign following an arrest for drunken driving.\n\nPerry was elected to the Texas House of Representatives as a Democrat in 1984 and endorsed then-Tennessee Sen. Al Gore for president in 1988, an endorsement he was attacked for in 2011 by Republican primary opponents.

I love \u2018em. Many, many people from Mexico are legal. They came in the old-fashioned way. Legally.\u201d\n\nHe quickly returned to the sharp tone that has brought him scorn as well as praise. \u201cI respect Mexico greatly as a country. But the problem we have is their leaders are much sharper than ours, and they\u2019re killing us at the border and they\u2019re killing us on trade.\u201d\n\nHis speeches in both venues were long on insults aimed at critics and short on solutions to the problems he cited. When he called for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, the audience in Las Vegas groaned.\n\nIn a break from the immigration rhetoric that has garnered him condemnation and praise, Trump asserted that he would have more positive results in dealing with China and Russia if he were president and said he could be pals with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAsked by an audience member in Las Vegas about U.S.-Russia relations, Trump said the problem is that Putin doesn\u2019t respect Obama.\n\n\u201cI think we would get along very, very well,\u201d he said.\n\nTrump has turned to victims of crime to bolster his argument that immigrants in the U.S. illegally have killed and raped.

He also directed familiar barbs at other presidential contenders, including Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton (\u201cthe worst secretary of state in the history of the country\u201d), news media figures (\u201clyin\u2019 Brian Williams\u201d) and President Barack Obama (\u201csuch a divisive person\u201d). He called journalists \u201cterrible people.\u201d\n\nAs Trump lambasted Univision for canceling its broadcast of the Miss USA pageant, one of his many business enterprises, a group of young Latinos unfurled a banner pointed toward the stage and began chanting insults. They were quickly drowned out by the crowd, and nearby Trump supporters began to grab at them, tearing at the banner and pulling and pushing at the protesters. Security staff managed to get to the group and escorted them out as Trump resumed speaking.\n\n\u201cI wonder if the Mexican government sent them over here,\u201d he said. \u201cI think so.\u201d\n\nArizona\u2019s tough-on-immigration Sheriff Joe Arpaio introduced Trump in Phoenix after outlining the things he and the candidate have in common, including skepticism that Obama was born in the United States.

Pat Roberts used the first debate in his unexpectedly competitive reelection campaign Saturday to try to brand his independent challenger as a liberal Democrat, mocking him for refusing to identify with either major party.\n\nChallenger Greg Orman got in his digs, too, during the event at the Kansas State Fair, poking fun of Roberts for repeatedly invoking Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s name in answers and saying, \u201cWhat I haven\u2019t heard from you is, \u2018Solve problems.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe debate capped a wild week in which the Democratic candidate withdrew, apparently bolstering Orman\u2019s chances in November, and in which Roberts overhauled his struggling campaign by replacing its manager and bringing in two national GOP operatives. What was once expected to be an easy victory for the GOP as it seeks to gain control of the Senate is now viewed as a competitive race.\n\nRoberts, 78, is seeking a fourth Senate term. Orman, a 45-year-old businessman from the Kansas City suburb of Olathe, has never held an elected office. He ran as a Democrat for Roberts\u2019 seat the last time it was up for grabs but dropped out well before the primary.\n\nIn front of a crowd of about 2,000 people at an open-air fairgrounds arena, Roberts played up his experience and said he\u2019s the only candidate who can be trusted to fight Reid and Democratic President Barack Obama. He invoked Reid\u2019s name so often that many in the crowd started booing, jeering and hooting whenever he did.\n\nWhile Roberts repeatedly suggested that Orman would help Reid and the Democrats once he got to Washington, he concluded by criticizing Orman for saying he would caucus with whatever party wins a majority.\n\n\u201cKansas needs someone in Washington with convictions and a backbone. I don\u2019t think my opponent has either,\u201d Roberts said in closing. \u201cFirst he says he\u2019s a Republican. Then he says he\u2019s a Democrat. Just this year, he becomes an independent. Ladies and gentlemen, what will Greg Orman be next week?\u201d\n\nOrman, who has been unaffiliated since 2010 but who had previously registered as both a Democrat and Republican, said after the debate that he has problems with the leaders of each party. He said he\u2019s a centrist who grew disappointed in both of them.\n\n\u201cOur system of government is broken, and we all know it,\u201d Orman said. \u201cI\u2019ve tried both parties, and like most Kansans, I\u2019ve been disappointed.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:07.277+0000", "event": "articles"}

But conversations about the possibility were a prominent feature of an August stay in South Carolina and his home in Delaware last week, these people said. A surprise weekend trip to Washington to meet with Sen.

Still, the vice president\u2019s deliberations illustrate how, with just six months before the first presidential nominating contests, both major parties\u2019 campaigns are in a state of flux. Democrats are increasingly insecure about Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy, given her dipping approval ratings and continuing questions about her use of a private email server while secretary of state.

Today, the U.S. Department of Justice should open up a criminal investigation into whether Planned Parenthood nationally is a criminal enterprise breaking the law.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson also spoke at the rally, held the day that a third undercover video was released by an anti-abortion group depicting Planned Parenthood officials discussing procedures for purchasing tissue samples from aborted fetuses. There were 65 rallies held across the country calling for defunding Planned Parenthood, according to the rally sponsor Students for Life.\n\nCruz was not optimistic about a federal investigation under the current administration.\n\n\u201cThe Department of Justice has had a long tradition over the centuries of fairly and impartially applying criminal law, enforcing criminal law regardless of party allegiance,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cHow sad is it that almost no media thinks there is any chance the U.S. Department of Justice would actually investigate whether Planned Parenthood and these senior officials violated federal criminal laws.

{"entityId": 1205, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Now that federal investigators have Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s homebrew email server, they could examine files on her machine that would be more revelatory than the emails themselves.\n\nClinton last week handed over to the FBI her private server, which she used to send, receive and store emails during her four years while secretary of state. The bureau is holding the machine in protective custody after the intelligence community\u2019s inspector general raised concerns that classified information had traversed the system.\n\nQuestions about her use of the server have shadowed her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton again this weekend repeated a carefully constructed defense of her actions, in that she did not send or receive emails marked classified at the time.\n\nBut her emails show some messages she wrote were censored by the State Department for national security reasons before they were publicly released. The government blacked out those messages under a provision of the Freedom of Information Act intended to protect material that had been deemed and properly classified for purposes of national defense or foreign policy.\n\nWhat hasn\u2019t been released: data that could show how secure her system was, whether someone tried to break in, and who else had accounts on her system. A lawyer for Platte River Networks, a Colorado-based technology services company that began managing the Clinton server in 2013, said the server was provided to the FBI last week.\n\nIndeed, many physical details of the server remain unknown, such as whether its data was backed up. In March, The Associated Press discovered that her server traced back to an Internet connection at her home in Chappaqua, New York.\n\nA computer server isn\u2019t a marvel of modern technology. Just like a home desktop, the computer\u2019s data is stored on a hard drive. It\u2019s unclear whether the drive that Clinton used was thoroughly erased before the device was turned over to federal agents.\n\nIf it had been, it\u2019s also uncertain whether the FBI could recover the data. Clinton\u2019s lawyer has used a precise term, \u201cwiped,\u201d to describe the deleted emails, but it was not immediately clear whether the server had been wiped. Such a process overwrites deleted content to make it harder or impossible to recover.\n\nAn FBI spokesman declined to comment.\n\nInvestigators who examine her server might find all sorts of information \u2013 how it was configured, whether it received necessary security updates to fix vulnerabilities in software, or whether anyone tried to access it without permission.\n\nRunning a server is akin to her messages being stored inside an office file cabinet. But while a file cabinet only yields the documents stored inside, a server can also offer information about the use of that data over time: Who had access to the filing cabinet? Did anyone try to pick the lock? Did the owner attempt to alter the files in any way? And who was given keys to the building in the first place?\n\nSince her server was first installed in 2009, it most likely used a traditional hard disk-based device rather than a newer solid state unit that only has become commonly used in the last two or three years, said computer scientist Darren Hayes. Solid state drives, until recently, were much more expensive than their counterparts for storing lots of data.\n\nForensics experts would then have an easier time retrieving erased data because such older, disk-based servers are not as efficient in deleting material, said Hayes, assistant professor and director of cybersecurity at Pace University\u2019s School of Computer Science and Information Systems in New York.\n\n\u201cA hard disk drive is very difficult to manipulate,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce you get your hands on a hard drive, there\u2019s a lot you can recover.\u201d\n\nEven after files are marked for deletion on a disk, Hayes said, their contents remain on the drive and can be retrieved. Even if the full file is gone, fragments can be pulled off the drive. Sometimes a complete email file even can be found inside other files marked for deletion.\n\nClinton said in March that she had exchanged about 60,000 emails during her four years in the Obama administration, about half of which were personal and deleted. She turned over the others to the State Department, which is reviewing and releasing them on a monthly basis.\n\nLast month, the inspector general for the nation\u2019s intelligence community warned that some of the information that passed through Clinton\u2019s server was classified information.\n\nIt\u2019s generally not possible to forward or cut-and-paste an email marked classified to a private account because classified email systems are closed to outsiders. But it can be illegal to paraphrase or retype classified information from a secure email into an unprotected message sent to a personal address.\n\nHayes said forensics experts could, in most cases, determine whether the server used encryption to transmit emails, which would be important in learning whether her occasional email discussions of classified and sensitive matters might have been vulnerable to hackers and snooping by foreign governments.\n\nThe server\u2019s internal registry could also provide hints of whether hackers penetrated the server\u2019s security.\n\n\u201cThey may have deleted a lot of data, but there\u2019s a lot of data that a good forensics team would be able to recover,\u201d he said.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:17.631+0000", "event": "articles"}

Conservative voters are trying to figure out who the conservative candidates are and the candidates are trying to figure out who the conservative voters are,\u201d said Robert J. Arnakis, a senior director at the Leadership Institute, which trains conservatives candidates and activists. \u201cThis election is about who can govern and make a difference. Competence is a central theme.\u201d\n\nSo far, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush appears the favorite among establishment Republicans, but annoys many conservatives. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is the main candidate with appeal to libertarian Republicans, while also being a leading contender for the Tea Party vote, which \u2013 like the social conservative vote \u2014 is up for grabs among several candidates.\n\nPaul has alienated national security hawks (also divided) as much as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz has agitated establishment Republicans. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio appear to have potential crossover appeal, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThe crowded field is why we are having a primary within a primary,\u201d said Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa, who\u2019s on the frontlines of the presidential battleground in the first presidential caucus state.\n\nHagle warned against writing off candidates like South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and former New York Gov. George Pataki, who aren\u2019t doing particularly well in polls right now. He recalled that former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum \u2013back for another run \u2013 was largely ignored on a shoestring campaign budget before emerging as the runner-up for the GOP nomination in 2012.\n\n\u201cThey will all have to try to appeal to more than one group,\u201d Hagle told TheBlaze. \u201cNo one wants to fit into the niche of \u2018I would never vote for that person.\u2019\u201d\n\nTea Party voters are looking for a candidate who will stand firmly against expanding the national debt, said Jenny Beth Martin, chairwoman of the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund.\n\n\u201cThe issues Tea Party voters care about are economic liberty, personal freedom and a debt-free future,\u201d Martin told TheBlaze. \u201cWe want to see the repeal of Obamacare and we want to see the penny plan enacted within five years. We want a candidate who will embrace all these issues. If a candidate does that, it will help him win the primary and win the general election.\u201d\n\nPaul, Cruz and Rubio all won their Senate campaigns backing Tea Party principles, Martin said.\n\nMartin doesn\u2019t see momentum building for any single candidate yet, but citing the most recent GOP presidential nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain, she said some candidates could have a tough time getting out the vote.\n\n\u201cA general election candidate needs to embrace our values when it comes to a candidate that can unite America,\u201d Martin said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a wishy-washy nominee. We are looking for someone who will embrace our solutions.\u201d\n\nThough a larger field than normal, it\u2019s also a better GOP field than normal, said Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist.\n\n\u201cIn 2012, we had two or three serious people, and eight were running to be a talk radio host,\u201d Norquist told TheBlaze. \u201cIf half this field were hit by a bus this year, we\u2019d still have the strongest Republican primary field probably since 1980. The depth and competency of the candidates is strong.\u201d\n\nNational polls are mixed, frequently showing a tie for first place, or a slight Bush lead. One poll found a small lead by famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson. But national polls generally matter far less than early primary state polls, where at least for now, things could be narrowing down to Walker vs. Bush.\n\nWalker, who plans to formally announce his candidacy later this month, has moved into a decisive lead in Iowa, whereas Bush leads comfortably in New Hampshire, with real estate mogul and reality TV star Donald Trump pulling second.\n\nAs for South Carolina, the verdict is split. A recent poll showed favorite son Graham \u2013 a long shot for the nomination \u2013 leading by two. But other previous polls showed both Bush and Walker leading in the state.\n\nIn the last weekend in June, Carson won the Western Conservative Summit\u2019s Republican presidential straw poll in Denver, and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina came in second place. The two have never won elected office before and straw polls are not scientific, but can indicate where the grassroots of the party stands.\n\n\u201cIn primaries and caucuses, the candidate who can mobilize the most voters has an advantage. In the Iowa caucus, it doesn\u2019t take that much to win,\u201d said Gary Rose, the chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University, who is writing about book on the 2016 presidential race.\n\nRose sees three main four groups in what he calls a \u201cfractured party\u201d: establishment Republicans inclined to support Bush or New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie; social conservatives inclined to support former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Santorum or Carson; Tea Party Republicans inclined to support inclined to back Paul, Cruz or Carson; and libertarian Republicans basically backing Paul.\n\nAs for social conservatives, both Huckabee (2008) and Santorum (2012) can stake their claim as having been runners-up in previous primaries for a party with a history of nominating the second-place finisher.\n\n\u201cScott Walker seems to be the one candidate right now with appeal to establishment, social conservatives and Tea Party Republicans,\u201d Rose told TheBlaze. \u201cJeb Bush has issues with immigration and people in the Republican Party still resent his brother. I don\u2019t think he is a shoo-in by any means.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor Rand Paul, the libertarian faction of the Republican Party is a small but committed group,\u201d Rose added. \u201cIt\u2019s the youngest and least well-funded group. But in most hypothetical matchups against Hillary Clinton, Rand Paul does very well.\u201d\n\nIn most polls, Hillary Clinton holds a 3-point lead over Paul. She opens up a more sizable lead on Bush of 5 or more. The same is true of Clinton\u2019s lead over former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. A recent Wall Street Journal poll actually showed Clinton with a 10-point lead over Rubio, but most other polls showed the hypothetical race within 3 or 4 percentage points. Walker also doesn\u2019t do as well against Clinton in hypothetical matchups, trailing her by 14 points in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll and by 8 points in a Quinnipiac poll. However, a CNN poll showed him trailing by just 3 points.", "score": 3, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:18.773+0000", "event": "articles"}

The House lawsuit seeks to hold President Barack Obama to his constitutional obligation to \u201ctake care that the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOften, the agency has not been able to accomplish the required action within the time provided by Congress,\u201d the CRS report stated. \u201cIn this type of situation, the agency simply has not taken any action; therefore, no rulemaking procedures are required. However, as mentioned above, an agency may be subject to a suit by a party seeking to compel the agency to take action.\u201d\n\nThe CRS report was first reported in a Washington Monthly piece by Simon Lazarus and Elisabeth Stein, attorneys with the Constitutional Accountability Center, a liberal think tank.\n\n\u201cIn other words, having been asked whether the Obama administration had crossed all its T\u2019s and dotted its I\u2019s, the CRS\u2019 answer was unequivocal: yes it had,\u201d the attorneys wrote in what they said was distilling the conclusion. \u201cIn bland CRS-speak, this seems like a veritable finger in the eye \u2013 or perhaps, a blunt warning to the speaker to drop the lawsuit project.\u201d\n\nThe CRS has no legally binding authority, but as the research arm of Congress has credibility with both sides.\n\nThe CRS report said courts determine whether these delays are reviewable in court by following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the 1985 case of Heckler v. Chaney, which held, \u201can agency\u2019s decision not to prosecute or enforce\u2026is a decision generally committed to an agency\u2019s absolute discretion,\u201d the CRS report said, quoting the high court ruling.\n\nThe CRS report continues saying the Administrative Procedure Act, or APA, provides \u201cadministrative enforcement discretion.\u201d\n\nThe report was not published to support or refute the House lawsuit, but rather to examine the legal questions of an agency\u2019s missed deadline for taking congressionally-mandated action, or suspended enforcement of a law passed by congress, and whether these delays are reviewable in court.\n\nA \u201cfact sheet\u201d from the speaker\u2019s office says the House lawsuit \u201cis not based on a violation of regulatory procedure.\u201d Boehner\u2019s office also said the report has nothing to do with when the lawsuit will be filed.\n\n\u201cWhen agencies implement new rules or regulations, the APA requires that certain rulemaking procedures are followed,\u201d the speaker\u2019s office said. \u201cHowever, an agency is not able to do whatever it pleases simply because it follows a rulemaking procedure.

{"entityId": 1209, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Story by the Associated Press; curated by Dave Urbanski\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Ben Carson, retired neurosurgeon turned conservative star, has confirmed that he will seek the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.\n\nCarson, who has never run for public office, is expected to be the only high-profile African-American to enter the GOP\u2019s presidential primary as he tries to parlay his success as an author and speaker into a competitive campaign against established politicians.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m willing to be part of the equation and therefore, I\u2019m announcing my candidacy for president of the United States of America,\u201d he said in an interview aired Sunday night by Ohio\u2019s WKRC television station.\n\nHe is set to make a more formal announcement during a speech from his native Detroit on Monday.\n\nCarson earned national acclaim during 29 years leading the pediatric neurosurgery unit of Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center in Baltimore, where he still lives. He directed the first surgery to separate twins connected at the back of the head. His career was notable enough to inspire the 2009 movie, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d with actor Cuba Gooding Jr. depicting Carson.\n\n\u201cI see myself as a member of \u2018we the people,\u2019\u201d he told the Associated Press in an interview earlier this year, arguing that his lack of experience is an asset.\n\n\u201cI see myself as a logical American who has common sense,\u201d he continued, \u201cand I think that\u2019s going to resonate with a lot of American, regardless of their political party.\u201d\n\nThe 63-year-old Detroit native remains largely unknown outside of conservative activists who have embraced him since his address at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, where he offered a withering critique of the modern welfare state and the nation\u2019s overall direction.\n\nThe speech restated themes from Carson\u2019s 2012 book \u201cAmerica the Beautiful,\u201d but he excited conservatives by doing so with President Barack Obama sitting just feet away.\n\nCarson has since become a forceful critic of the nation\u2019s first black president on everything from health care to foreign policy. Carson also offers himself as a counter to other notable African-American commentators with more liberal views.\n\nMost recently, Carson has spoken out on the unrest in his hometown, where residents have protested and rioted in the wake of Freddie Gray dying while in custody of the Baltimore Police Department. In a Time op-ed, Carson decried the protests and related vandalism as \u201cgross misconduct.\u201d\n\nCarson moved to Palm Beach, Florida, after his retirement from Johns Hopkins, but he is announcing his campaign in his hometown of Detroit, where his mother raised him and his brother in poverty.\n\nHe attributes his politics to his upbringing, often describing his neighborhood culture as one where residents celebrating any new announcement of government support. Still, he acknowledges that his mother received welfare aid, and he insists that he supports \u201ca safety net for the people who need a safety net.\u201d\n\nCarson is a staunch social conservative, opposing abortion rights and same-sex marriage, views he attributes to his personal faith as a practicing Christian.\n\nHe has more complex views on health care and foreign policy, including statements that could put him at odds with the most conservative branches of his party.\n\nHe has compared the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, to slavery. Yet Carson also has blasted for-profit insurance companies; called for stricter regulations \u2014 including of prices \u2014 of health care services; and said government should offer a nationalized insurance program for catastrophic care.\n\nCarson pitches himself as a staunch supporter of Israel in its disputes with other Middle Eastern nations, and he has hammered Obama on his dealings in the region. But in his earlier writings, Carson criticized the U.S. for historically being too eager to wage war.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Dave Urbanski (@DaveVUrbanski) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:22.910+0000", "event": "articles"}

A Justice Department spokeswoman told Politico, \u201cThe Department has received a referral related to the potential compromise of classified information.

The reason, he said, is fewer competitive House seats over the last two decades, which drives the party activists on both sides to be more ideological.\n\n\u201cThat certainly makes it more difficult for [Hillary Clinton] to seek the nomination as a centrist, or at least as the type of centrist [Bill Clinton] was in 1992,\u201d Hagle said.\n\nHere are six areas where the former secretary of state seems to be running against the record of President Clinton\u2019s administration.\n\n1. Free Trade\n\nPresident Clinton antagonized many in his party\u2019s base with NAFTA and advocating for other free trade deals. However, during her 2008 presidential campaign, Hillary Clinton called for a \u201ctimeout\u201d on trade deals.\n\nToday, the Trans-Pacific Partnership is causing division among Democrats. After initial support while serving as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton is being iffy at best about whether she will support the President Barack Obama-backed Asian trade deal, which organized labor opposes.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests,\u201d Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill said in a statement last week. \u201cFirst, it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen our national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls short of these tests. The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\nJust before leaving the State Department in January 2013, Clinton spoke in favor of the deal. \u201cIn order to keep producing jobs and rising incomes, we have to be smart about how we use our economies,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I think the Trans-Pacific Partnership is one way that could really enhance our relationship.\u201d\n\n2. Keystone XL Pipeline\n\nNot all differences emerge from Bill Clinton\u2019s days in the Oval Office.\n\nIn January 2012, during Clinton\u2019s tenure, the State Department recommended that Obama reject the Keystone XL pipeline, kicking off a prolonged, ongoing review by the department.\n\nA little more than a month later, Bill Clinton gave his support for the pipeline, saying, \u201cI think we should embrace it and develop a stakeholder-driven system of high standards for doing the work.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton has since avoided the topic. Don\u2019t count on her taking her husband\u2019s side on this matter during the campaign, Hagle said.\n\n\u201cI also can\u2019t see her getting behind the Keystone pipeline in a serious way given the emphasis on climate change within her party, particularly the more progressive left,\u201d Hagle said.\n\n3. Entitlement Reform\n\nStumping in New Hampshire this week, Hillary Clinton stated her policy on Social Security: \u201cWe don\u2019t mess with it.\u201d\n\nYet President Clinton was willing to \u201cmess\u201d with entitlements as the next order of business after the bipartisan balanced budget deal, saying in 1997, \u201cIt could be done before the \u201998 election.\u201d\n\nThe bipartisan mood in Washington collapsed in early 1998 with the Clinton impeachment scandal.\n\n\u201cThe Clinton administration wanted to reach a deal, but Monica Lewinsky sort of got in the way of that,\u201d said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute. \u201cHillary Clinton is in an interesting position. Does she harken back to Bill Clinton or does she go the direction of [Massachusetts Democratic Sen.] Elizabeth Warren, who wants to expand Social Security?\u201d\n\n4. Same-Sex Marriage\n\nIn 2013, Hillary Clinton announced she had changed her stance on same-sex marriage from her 2008 opposition. Last week, the campaign announced an official position, when spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod said, \u201cHillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right.\u201d\n\nPresident Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996. The bill recognized marriage as only between one man and one woman and prevents one state from being forced to recognize a gay marriage from another state. For his part, Bill Clinton also changed his position on DOMA, but his wife\u2019s campaign stance still represents a departure from the Clinton presidential legacy.\n\n5. Income Inequality\n\nThe wage gap was not something Bill Clinton talked a lot about during the booming 1990s. But as Obama and other Democrats have taken up the cause, Hillary Clinton has too.\n\nClinton said last week, \u201dThere\u2019s something wrong when CEOs make 300 times more than the typical worker.\u201d\n\nBut, as the Washington Post reported, the disparity between the highest and lowest earners jumped from 75\u2013to\u20131 before the Clinton administration to 400\u2013to\u20131 during the Clinton administration. As the economy worsened, the gap narrowed.\n\n6. \u2018Vigorous Government\u2019\n\nBill Clinton\u2019s 1996 declaration that the \u201cera of big government is over\u201d may have been incorrect, but it\u2019s also represents the change in the Democratic party and a difference with Hillary Clinton\u2019s assertions during her previous campaign.\n\nIn her 2008 campaign, Hillary Clinton said, \u201cWe were most successful when we had that balance between an effective, vigorous government and a dynamic, appropriately regulated market.\u201d\n\nThat approach isn\u2019t likely to change with her new campaign, analysts say.\n\n\u201cThere was a time when people said the Democratic Leadership Council was the future of the party,\u201d Tanner said, referring to a moderate Democratic group. \u201cNow, most of the moderate new Democrats, [former Nebraska Sen.] Bob Kerrey, [former Louisiana Sen.] John Breaux, they\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nEven though she is far ahead of any potential Democratic rivals, a move to the left is still needed to mollify the base, Hagle said.\n\n\u201cOne of the things Hillary Clinton needs to do is win big, not just by default,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cOne way to do that is say the kinds of things that energize her base.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cOf course, for the general election she wouldn\u2019t want to be too far to the left or she\u2019ll lose a lot of voters in the center.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:30.184+0000", "event": "articles"}

County Republican Liberty Caucus, explained on The Glenn Beck Program Tuesday. \u201cNon-aggression, non-intervention, sound money. And we\u2019ve done a lot to be really involved in the party, so we\u2019re not just libertarians who take these positions and go on Facebook and argue all the time. \u2026 We actually got our hands dirty.\u201d\n\n\u201cEach of us pulled papers and ran for central committee to be locally elected officials,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve since just been climbing the ranks through the establishment party.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou guys are so wicked smart for doing this,\u201d Beck commented.\n\nAmir Zendehnam, secretary of the L.A. County Republican Liberty Caucus, said: \u201cI like to say that we\u2019re trying to reclaim the American right. As libertarians, our principles stem from a very basic thing called the non-aggression principle, which is, do not initiate violence on others, and only [use violence] in self-defense. \u2026 And also self-ownership, which is, we own our body and we own the fruits of our labors.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is slowly interject these ideas into the Republican Party,\u201d Zendehnam said.\n\nNick Hankoff, chair of the LA County Republican Liberty Caucus, said they aren\u2019t trying to \u201cmake other people libertarian all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s probably the first libertarian you run into, is someone trying to convert you or something,\u201d he said with a laugh. \u201cI think the first thing is just, making it fun to be around libertarians.\u201d\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nZendehnam said that when you abide by the non-aggression principle, you can come together even when you have profound disagreements.\n\n\u201cNoah [Johnson] is super religious, I\u2019m not religious at all,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we agree because we both adhere to the non-aggression principle. \u2026 I always tell people who are going at each other\u2019s throats \u2026 if you guys aren\u2019t hurting each other, you should be working together!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are trying to really bring everybody together,\u201d Zendehnam continued. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find common ground with people. We\u2019re trying to work with people because, like I was saying, everybody keeps fighting in politics. We are trying to bring a new face to this society where we can actually be working together instead of jumping at each other\u2019s throats, because one person thinks something about gay marriage and then the other person thinks that about gay marriage.\u201d\n\nBeck noted that there has been a rift between libertarians and people of faith, and asked more about how they see the two working together.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a Christian myself,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cChrist himself has a very libertarian perspective on the world \u2014 love your neighbor, do unto others as you would have them do unto you. And when you look at his stance against the government \u2014 he actually stood against Caesar. He wasn\u2019t killed for being just a pious man. He was killed because his principles undermined the authority of the state. If [you're] going to live for the kingdom of heaven, you can\u2019t live for the kingdom of this world.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I think that Christians and religious people, people of faith, but particularly Christians, have a strong ground to speak in a libertarian manner,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cThat people should be responsible for their actions and we should have a voluntary society where we work together, where charity doesn\u2019t come from just government stipends, it comes from the heart. And the laws \u2014 abortion, gay rights, things like this \u2014 we have a very laissez-faire about it. But it\u2019s not because we don\u2019t care about those issues. I\u2019m pro-life. But I think that unless the people\u2019s hearts change, the laws aren\u2019t going to mean anything.\u201d\n\nHankoff concluded: \u201cThe way we do that in practice is through coalitions. I would recommend to people, when you go back home and you want to be politically active, pick an issue that\u2019s really strong for you. In Los Angeles, we\u2019re taking apart the NSA and the local parking politburo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever level it is, if you find an issue, you\u2019re more than likely going to find people to come together with you,\u201d he said. \u201cThe coalitions grow, and we can do that with libertarianism at the center.\u201d\n\nThe full episode of The Glenn Beck Program, along with many other live-streaming shows and thousands of hours of on-demand content, is available on just about any digital device.

The question for me is: What am I going to do about it? And I have decided,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI am a candidate for president of the United States.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at Miami-Dade College\u2019s Kendall campus and surrounded by supporters sporting signs with the red letters of \u201cJeb!\u201d, Bush leaned heavily on his record as governor.\n\n\u201cI know we can fix this because I\u2019ve done it,\u201d Bush said. \u201cHere, in this great and diverse state that looks so much like America. So many challenges could be overcome if we just get this economy growing at full strength. There is not a reason in the world why we cannot grow at a rate of 4 percent a year. And that will be my goal as president \u2013 4 percent growth, and the 19 million new jobs that come with it.\u201d\n\nIn a message that hit home with the Miami crowd, Bush criticized Obama for normalizing relations with Cuba.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t need a glorified tourist to go to Havana in support of a failed Cuba,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe need an American president to go to Havana in solidarity with a free Cuban people, and I am ready to be that president.\u201d\n\nThe audience of supporters shouted, \u201cLet\u2019s go Jeb.\u201d\n\nHe has touted a record of cutting taxes, education reform and fiscal responsibility. He has also tried to assert that he has appeal beyond the traditional Republican voter base.\n\nDespite his name recognition, or perhaps because of it, Bush has been unable to open up any significant lead over his Republican rivals. Most polls show no clear frontrunner for the GOP nominating contest. The opposite is of course true in the Democratic presidential primary where Clinton has a commanding lead over all of her Democratic opponents. Bush is also lagging behind other GOP contenders in head-to-head matches with Clinton.\n\nHe seemed to take a shot at the four senators vying for the GOP nomination\n\n\u201cAs our whole nation has learned since 2008, executive experience is another term for preparation, and there is no substitute for that,\u201d Bush said. \u201cWe are not going to clean up the mess in Washington by electing the people who either helped create it or have proven incapable of fixing it.\u201d\n\nBush has drawn the ire of many conservatives for his support of the controversial Common Core education standards, and for supporting a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d for the nation\u2019s 11 million illegal immigrants. He further called the NSA\u2019s bulk data collection the best part of the Obama administration.

He was also zinged for identifying himself as a Hispanic on a 2009 voter registration form. Meanwhile, other conservatives have called him out for his praise of likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nTo allay these fears on th right, he made a pitch for shrinking the power of the federal government.\n\n\u201cWhat the IRS, EPA and entire bureaucracy have done with overregulation, we can undo by act of Congress and order of the president,\u201d Bush said. \u201cFederal regulation has gone far past the consent of the governed.It is time to start making rules for the rule-makers.\u201d\n\nHe further warned Clinton would not protect religious freedom, bringing up the Little Sisters of the Poor lawsuit over the Obamcare contraception mandate.\n\n\u201cThe next president needs to make it clear that great charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor need no federal instruction in doing the right thing,\u201d Bush said. \u201cIt comes down to a choice between the Little Sisters and Big Brother, and I\u2019m going with the Sisters.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:36.977+0000", "event": "articles"}

I am convinced that by acknowledging the pain and loss of others, even as we respect the traditions and ways of life that make up this beloved country, by making the moral choice to change, we express God\u2019s grace.\u201d\n\nThe entire message was not political.\n\nThe large audience leaped to its feet at Obama spoke inspiringly about how the Charleston community came together in the aftermath of what the killer hoped would tear it apart.\n\n\u201cAn act he imagined would incite fear and recrimination, violence and suspicion, an act that he presumed would deepen divisions that trace back to our nation\u2019s original sin,\u201d Obama said.\n\n\u201cOh, but God works in mysterious ways,\u201d Obama said to rousing applause. Almost shouting to speak over the applause, Obama added, \u201cGod has different ideas.\u201d\n\nObama did not name Dylann Roof, the alleged shooter who reportedly claimed his goal was to start a race war. But to loud applause, the president talked about what Roof did not anticipate.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t know he was being used by God.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlinded by hatred, the alleged killer could not see the grace surrounding the Reverend Pinckney and that Bible study group, the light of love that shown as they opened the church doors and invited a stranger to join in their prayer service,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe alleged killer could have never anticipated the way the families of the fallen would respond when they saw him in court \u2013 in the midst of unspeakable grief \u2013 with words of forgiveness.

{"entityId": 1226, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 The computer server that transmitted and received Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails \u2014 on a private account she used exclusively for official business when she was secretary of state \u2014 traced back to an Internet service registered to her family\u2019s home in Chappaqua, New York, according to Internet records reviewed by The Associated Press.\n\nThe highly unusual practice of a Cabinet-level official physically running her own email would have given Clinton, the presumptive Democratic presidential candidate, impressive control over limiting access to her message archives. It also would distinguish Clinton\u2019s secretive email practices as far more sophisticated than some politicians, including Mitt Romney and Sarah Palin, who were caught conducting official business using free email services operated by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc.\n\nMost Internet users rely on professional outside companies, such as Google Inc. or their own employers, for the behind-the-scenes complexities of managing their email communications. Government employees generally use servers run by federal agencies where they work.\n\nIn most cases, individuals who operate their own email servers are technical experts or users so concerned about issues of privacy and surveillance they take matters into their own hands. It was not immediately clear exactly where Clinton ran that computer system.\n\nClinton has not described her motivation for using a private email account \u2014 hdr22@clintonemail.com, which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym \u2014 for official State Department business.\n\nOperating her own server would have afforded Clinton additional legal opportunities to block government or private subpoenas in criminal, administrative or civil cases because her lawyers could object in court before being forced to turn over any emails. And since the Secret Service was guarding Clinton\u2019s home, an email server there would have been well protected from theft or a physical hacking.\n\nBut homemade email servers are generally not as reliable, secure from hackers or protected from fires or floods as those in commercial data centers. Those professional facilities provide monitoring for viruses or hacking attempts, regulated temperatures, off-site backups, generators in case of power outages, fire-suppression systems and redundant communications lines.\n\nA spokesman for Clinton did not respond to requests seeking comment from the AP on Tuesday. Clinton ignored the issue during a speech Tuesday night at the 30th anniversary gala of EMILY\u2019s List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights.\n\nIt was unclear whom Clinton hired to set up or maintain her private email server, which the AP traced to a mysterious identity, Eric Hoteham. That name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches. Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton\u2019s $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010.\n\nThe Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton\u2019s email server. The former president\u2019s full name is William Jefferson Clinton.\n\nIn November 2012, without explanation, Clinton\u2019s private email account was reconfigured to use Google\u2019s servers as a backup in case her own personal email server failed, according to Internet records. That is significant because Clinton publicly supported Google\u2019s accusations in June 2011 that China\u2019s government had tried to break into the Google mail accounts of senior U.S. government officials. It was one of the first instances of a major American corporation openly accusing a foreign government of hacking.\n\nThen, in July 2013, five months after she resigned as secretary of state, Clinton\u2019s private email server was reconfigured again to use a Denver-based commercial email provider, MX Logic, which is now owned by McAfee Inc., a top Internet security company.\n\nThe New York Times reported Monday that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account it did not specify to conduct State Department business. The disclosure raised questions about whether she took actions to preserve copies of her old work-related emails, as required by the Federal Records Act. A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, told the newspaper that Clinton complied with the letter and spirit of the law because her advisers reviewed tens of thousands of pages of her personal emails to decide which ones to turn over to the State Department after the agency asked for them.\n\nIn theory but not in practice, Clinton\u2019s official emails would be accessible to anyone who requested copies under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act. Under the law, citizens and foreigners can compel the government to turn over copies of federal records for zero or little cost. Since Clinton effectively retained control over emails in her private account even after she resigned in 2013, the government would have to negotiate with Clinton to turn over messages it can\u2019t already retrieve from the inboxes of federal employees she emailed.\n\nThe AP has waited more than a year under the open records law for the State Department to turn over some emails covering Clinton\u2019s tenure as the nation\u2019s top diplomat, although the agency has never suggested that it didn\u2019t possess all her emails.\n\nClinton\u2019s private email account surfaced publicly in March 2013 after a convicted Romanian hacker known as Guccifer published emails stolen from former White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal. The Internet domain was registered around the time of her secretary of state nomination.\n\nRep. Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., chairman of the special House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, said the committee learned last summer \u2014 when agency documents were turned over to the committee \u2014 that Clinton had used a private email account while secretary of state. More recently the committee learned that she used private email accounts exclusively and had more than one, Gowdy said.\n\nPresident Barack Obama signed a bill last year that bans the use of private email accounts by government officials unless they retain copies of messages in their official account or forward copies to their government accounts within 20 days. The bill did not become law until more than one year after Clinton left the State Department.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:13:50.070+0000", "event": "articles"}

During Monday\u2019s debate, they sounded a theme they have employed in recent elections, characterizing the GOP drive as an assault on health care for women.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our obligation to protect our wives, our sisters, our daughters, our granddaughters\u201d from the GOP\u2019s \u201cabsurd policies,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. \u201cThe Republican Party has lost its moral compass.\u201d\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said Democrats should not protect Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal funds \u201cjust to protect some political group,\u201d an apparent reference to the organization\u2019s one-sided campaign contributions to Democratic candidates.\n\nRepublican Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa said, \u201cThe American taxpayer should not be asked to fund an organization like Planned Parenthood that has shown a sheer disdain for human dignity and complete disregard for women and their babies.\u201d\n\nErnst sponsored the measure as party leaders sought ways to blunt Democratic charges of GOP insensitivity to women.\n\nThe only senators to cross party lines were Democrats Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, and Illinois Republican Mark Kirk, who faces a tough re-election fight next year. McConnell joined Democrats in voting to block the bill, a procedural move that allows him to force a fresh vote later. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a presidential candidate, was in New Hampshire and missed the vote.\n\nThe anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress has so far released four videos in which people posing as representatives of a company that purchases fetal tissue converse with Planned Parenthood officials. The videos have been especially controversial because of the casual descriptions by the Planned Parenthood officials of the abortion procedures they use to obtain tissue, and because some of the videos show close-ups of fetal organs in laboratories.\n\nThe center and some of its GOP supporters have said the videos show that Planned Parenthood sells the tissue for profit, which is illegal under federal law.\n\nPlanned Parenthood says the videos are selectively edited and that the organization only recovers costs of the procedures \u2014 which is legal \u2014 and only gives the tissue to researchers with a mother\u2019s advance consent and in fewer than five states.\n\nStung by past government shutdowns that voters have blamed on Republicans, GOP leaders have shown no interest in another one this fall. Federal agencies run out of money on Oct. 1, and Congress is tasked with passing legislation by then temporarily keeping the doors open until lawmakers and President Barack Obama can reach a longer-term agreement.\n\nBut it could be challenging for those Republican leaders to control their most conservative lawmakers, who are urged on by the party\u2019s anti-abortion activists. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, R-S.C., has said he expects to get several dozen signatures on a letter opposing any spending bill containing money for Planned Parenthood, and some GOP senators, including Cruz, Paul and others, have voiced similar sentiments.\n\nThe Republican measure calls for funneling Planned Parenthood\u2019s federal dollars to other providers of health care to women, including hospitals, state and local agencies and federally financed community health centers.\n\nRepublicans say that transfer would enable women to continue receiving the health care they need because Planned Parenthood\u2019s nearly 700 clinics are far outnumbered by other providers.\n\nPlanned Parenthood and Democrats contest that. They say many of the organization\u2019s centers are in areas with few alternatives for reproductive health care or for other services for the low-income women who comprise a majority of its clients.\n\nPlanned Parenthood receives more than $500 million yearly in government funds \u2014 including state payments \u2014 more than one-third of its annual $1.3 billion in revenue. Its annual report says it provides services for 2.7 million people annually, mostly women, with abortions accounting for 3 percent.\n\nBy law, federal funds are already barred from being used for abortions except for cases of incest, rape or when a woman\u2019s life is in danger.\n\n\u2014", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:14:04.716+0000", "event": "articles"}

As he noted in the speech, Santorum has shown himself able to appeal beyond a narrow base as a two-term senator in Pennsylvania, a state that typically votes Democratic in presidential campaigns. He lost his Senate seat in the 2006 Democratic tidal wave to Democrat Bob Casey Jr. by a 17-percent margin.\n\nSantorum has complained about the rules limiting candidate for Republican presidential debates based on their polling, citing that he was at single digits in national polls before surging to second place after his narrow Iowa caucus win over Romney in 2012.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:14:07.462+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1241, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s reluctance to enter the presidential race centers on his family. His wife, Jill, has never relished political life and is said to share his misgivings about whether the Bidens are emotionally equipped for another campaign.\n\nThose close to the second lady say she won\u2019t stand in the way of her husband\u2019s political ambitions, but her feelings about a White House bid are a major factor in Biden\u2019s decision. Only three months after losing their son, Beau, to brain cancer, the 72-year-old Biden appeared somber and weary at an Atlanta synagogue Thursday night as he pondered his family\u2019s readiness. \u201cThe honest-to-God answer is I just don\u2019t know,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile the vice president\u2019s deliberations have played out in semi-public fashion, Jill Biden\u2019s have taken place away from the spotlight. She has yet to discuss in detail with her staff her views on a possible presidential run. But she has been looking out for her husband and echoing his concerns about whether he can completely devote himself to a hard-fought campaign, according to several people who have spoken to her in recent weeks.\n\nSome of these people demanded anonymity because they didn\u2019t feel comfortable publicly discussing the family\u2019s private deliberations.\n\nSonia Sloan, a Biden family friend since the 1970s who volunteered for his past campaigns, said she saw the Bidens at a mutual friend\u2019s funeral a few weeks ago and that their grief was \u201cjust written all over them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBeau was always a part of those deliberations, and they are grieving terribly,\u201d Sloan said. \u201cWhen he\u2019s run in the past, the family\u2019s been a very active part. This time, given the situation, it will be a really long, thoughtful process.\u201d\n\nJill Biden campaigned actively for her husband when he ran in 2008, and then when he joined President Barack Obama\u2019s winning ticket. As second lady, she has played a visible role promoting education and military families. Said her spokesman, James Gleeson: \u201cAnyone speculating about Dr. Biden is only doing just that \u2014 speculating.\u201d\n\nShe previously has said her husband would make an excellent president, Gleeson noted, adding that \u201cshe will continue to support him in his career, as he has always supported Dr. Biden in hers.\u201d\n\nSpeculation about a late entrance by Biden has spiked in recent weeks as he has actively explored the possibility of jumping in. Such a move would reshuffle the Democratic primary at a time when some in the party are concerned about Hillary Rodham Clinton\u2019s campaign struggles and pine for more options. Forty-five percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they wanted Biden to run in a Gallup poll last month.\n\nBiden has been speaking with donors, longtime supporters and potential endorsers as aides and friends tally how much money they might be able to raise for a campaign and how quickly. He and his advisers have told potential supporters that if he were to run, he would not attack Clinton, despite persistent questions about her use of a private email account and server while secretary of state.\n\n\u201cHe has to make a really difficult decision,\u201d Clinton said in an interview with NBC News on Friday. \u201cYou can see him struggling with it and I just wish the best for him and his family. If he gets into this race, there will be plenty of time to get into the debate and the back and forth.\u201d\n\nBiden, in his most extensive public remarks on his deliberations, said Thursday it would come down to his family\u2019s emotional outlook \u2014 not on practical considerations like the other candidates\u2019 standing and building a viable campaign organization.\n\n\u201cThe factor is can I do it. Can my family undertake what is an arduous commitment that we\u2019d be proud to undertake in ordinary circumstances?\u201d Biden said.\n\nWeighing heavily is Beau\u2019s wish, conveyed before his death, for his father to run. Another son, Hunter, has been among those reaching out to potential supporters. And sister Valerie Biden Owens, who led previous campaigns, has been intimately involved with the discussions, aides said.\n\nAfter Biden\u2019s wife and infant daughter died in a 1972 car crash, Jill Biden adopted Beau and Hunter. In 2008, Beau Biden corrected NBC\u2019s Ann Curry when she referred to Jill Biden as his stepmother. \u201cMy mom,\u201d he interjected.\n\nAsked whether she was his father\u2019s top adviser, Beau Biden added, \u201cI call her his number one partner. And it covers all facets.\u201d\n\nA community college professor and former high school teacher, Jill Biden has never hid her lack of enthusiasm for life in the public spotlight, despite supporting her husband\u2019s career. In his 2007 book, \u201cPromises to Keep,\u201d Biden said his wife was \u201csensitive to the demands of a presidential campaign\u201d before he ran in 1988 and told him their \u201cchildren\u2019s lives would surely change.\u201d\n\nShe has continued teaching full time throughout his vice presidency, maintaining her own life in addition to her work as second lady. \u201cShe says her students inspire her,\u201d Biden said Thursday, noting that she returned to the classroom two weeks ago.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a tough, smart, compassionate woman who cares about him and about the family,\u201d said Mark Gitenstein, a former U.S. ambassador and Biden friend who worked for him in the Senate. About Biden\u2019s family, Gitenstein said, \u201cHe won\u2019t do something they don\u2019t want to do, and they won\u2019t do something he doesn\u2019t want to do.\u201d", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:14:12.603+0000", "event": "articles"}

Some people will instead choose security in exchange for freedom. Human nature allows for a percentage of wimps who don\u2019t believe in themselves. But if 55-70 percent of Americans aged 60 and older tend to lean conservative, that should apply across the board.\n\nOnly, it doesn\u2019t. In fact, it\u2019s not even close.\n\nThe last two presidential elections tell the tale: Republicans lost the young people\u2019s (ages 18-29) vote 66 percent to 32 percent in 2008 and 60 percent to 36 percent in 2012. And those aged 30-44 went to Obama by a significant margin in both elections.\n\nIn a nutshell: Unless there is a huge demographic change, there will never be more conservatives than yesterday.\n\nFOX NEWS WON\u2019T SAVE US\n\nSo how did conservatives find themselves so far off the plot? [\u2026]\n\nWe conservatives tend to congregate with like-minded people\u2014as every ideological group does\u2014but the echo-chamber effect in the conservative movement is exceptionally strong. More frighteningly, it has deluded many people involved with the movement: Rather than facing the growing demographic problem, conservatives have convinced themselves that it doesn\u2019t exist.\n\n\u201cLiberals can say what they want! We\u2019re still No. 1 in news!\u201d\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nOf course, that\u2019s the big elephant in the room, Fox News. And it\u2019s true, Fox News is the most conservative of news outlets and does pull impressive numbers. As a matter of fact, FNC touts the highest numbers anywhere in cable news, averaging around 1.8 million total viewers in primetime and 1 million daily, according to a September report from Mediabistro.com.\n\nBut the key words are \u201ccable news\u201d\u2014not \u201ccable\u201d or \u201cnews.\u201d Cable news. Essentially, Fox is No. 1 in a talent pool of three: MSNBC, CNN and Fox News. \u2026\n\n\u2026 When it comes to cultural influence, all cable news networks receive ratings for which the news team would be promptly fired at an alphabet network. NBC\u2019s Brian Williams, for example, pulled in an average of 8 million nightly viewers in mid-August, reported Mediabistro. And ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer had 7.7 million, with 2 million coming from the coveted 25-54-year-old demographic. Even Scott Pelley\u2019s \u201cCBS Evening News\u201d had 6.2 million viewers.\n\nMore alarmingly, an ever-increasing share of millennials get their news from alternative outlets such as Comedy Central, MTV and HBO.\n\nMost importantly, many young people don\u2019t watch news on television at all. Instead, they spend their tube time on any of the other soft liberal programming the alphabet and cable networks pump out on an hourly basis. From \u201cModern Family\u201d to the entire MTV line-up, viewers are bombarded with political/cultural messages day in and day out whether they know it or not.\n\nSo now we are comparing the influence of a place like Fox News to that of not only MSNBC and CNN but also all of the alphabet networks\u2019 news broadcasts and nearly all of network and cable programming combined.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nChanges the picture a little bit, doesn\u2019t it?\n\n[\u2026]\n\nLEAN TO THE LEFT, NOT TO THE RIGHT\n\nWhen young voters are actually polled for their opinions, we find that they are actually quite far from conservative. In a piece for HotAir.com titled \u201cLibertarian Poll: Millennials Are \u2026 Pretty Liberal, Actually,\u201d writer \u201cAllahpundit\u201d analyzed a recent survey from the libertarian team at Reason.com (see \u201cMillennials\u2019 Real Politics\u201d sidebar). Looking at the data, he discovered the youngest generation of voters are \u201cnot so libertarianish.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillennials do have some right-wing leanings, of course\u2014they\u2019re open in principle to cutting taxes and spending, prefer to see wealth distributed according to achievement, and most importantly, heavily favor privatized Social Security accounts,\u201d Allahpundit noted. \u201cThat\u2019s a sign of growing awareness of the entitlement crisis among the generation that\u2019s going to suffer the most from it. Dare we hope that they might be serious about balancing America\u2019s books? Actually, no. We daren\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThe real polling numbers of what millennials believe, as reported by Reason, belie a perceived conservative image:\n\n\u27a4 74 percent: government should guarantee every citizen has a place to sleep and enough to eat; \u27a4 72 percent: raise the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour; \u27a4 69 percent: government should guarantee everyone access to health care; \u27a4 68 percent: government should ensure everyone makes a living wage; \u27a4 66 percent: raising taxes on the wealthy would help the economy; \u27a4 63 percent: spending more on job training would help the economy; \u27a4 58 percent: government should spend more on assistance to the poor even it means higher taxes; \u27a4 57 percent: spend more money on infrastructure; \u27a4 54 percent: government should guarantee everyone a college education; and \u27a4 51 percent: view Obamacare favorably.\n\nAlso telling from the Reason poll was millennials\u2019 stated preference for bigger government. When asked to choose between a smaller government providing fewer services and a larger government providing more services, they chose the larger government 54 percent to 43 percent.\n\nWhen the question was changed to point out that larger government meant higher taxes the numbers essentially flipped, with 41 percent supporting a larger government and 57 percent favoring a smaller government.\n\n****Click here to subscribe and get a FREE issue today****\n\nDo those people sound conservative\u2014at all? The point here is that rather than face a very serious problem threatening conservatism, many people are more comfortable in telling themselves that we\u2019re actually winning, and it\u2019ll all be OK.\n\nIt\u2019s not OK. It\u2019s beyond not OK.\n\nIt can\u2019t be stressed enough that, unless there is a monumental demographic shift in the conservative movement, there will never be any more conservatives than yesterday.\n\nSTEPS TO RECOVERY\n\nThe good news is that there is hope.

He has also said \u201cthere\u2019s a very good chance\u201d Clinton lied to him during a congressional hearing when she addressed his concerns about those weapons.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s no way that Hillary Clinton did not know about this.

His mother was an American citizen.\n\nThat, however, doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t a \u201cnatural-born citizen,\u201d according to a bipartisan article in the Law Review published by a former Bush and a former Obama law official.\n\n\u201cWe have both had the privilege of heading the Office of the Solicitor General during different administrations,\u201d Paul Clement, the solicitor general during George W. Bush\u2019s second term, and Neal Katyal, who served for a time as acting solicitor general for Obama, wrote. \u201cWe may have different ideas about the ideal candidate in the next presidential election, but we agree on one important principle: voters should be able to choose from all constitutionally eligible candidates, free from spurious arguments that a U.S. citizen at birth is somehow not constitutionally eligible to serve as President simply because he was delivered at a hospital abroad.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the happenstance of a birth across the border, there is no question that Senator Cruz has been a citizen from birth and is thus a \u2018natural born citizen\u2019 within the meaning of the Constitution,\u201d they added, while also pointing to the example of John McCain, who was born on a military base in the Panama Canal zone.\n\n\u201cThere are plenty of serious issues to debate in the upcoming presidential election cycle. The less time spent dealing with specious objections to candidate eligibility, the better,\u201d the pair wrote.\n\nCruz has been sending strong signals lately that he\u2019s going to join the 2016 race. In January, he told Fox News he was looking at it \u201cvery seriously.\u201d He repeated that to CNN a month later. And on Friday, he gave the strongest indication yet to Glenn Beck, not only again saying he was considering it \u201cseriously,\u201d but also going on to talk about scheduled stops in key primary states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\n\u201cThose are not necessarily states chosen at random,\u201d he told Beck, who wasn\u2019t shy about interpreting what that meant: \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled. And I know we say this jokingly every time. Everybody heard that Ted Cruz just announced he was running for president.\u201d\n\nAnd now it seems Cruz has bipartisan support in the key area of eligibility if and when he chooses to make it official.\n\n(H/T: Dallas Morning News)", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:14:41.933+0000", "event": "articles"}

In particular, he failed to provide the context in which Obama made his remarks\u2014the takeover of Fallujah by ISIS,\u201d Kessler continued. \u201cThat\u2019s fairly misleading. The interviewer was certainly asking about ISIS when Obama answered with his \u2018JV\u2019 remarks.\u201d\n\nEarnest was trying to explain Obama\u2019s comments, published in an interview with the New Yorker in January. Obama said that \u201cthe analogy we use around here sometimes and I think is accurate is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn\u2019t make them Kobe Bryant.\u201d The Jan. 7 interview was conducted four days after the Islamic State took over Fallujah.\n\nWhen a reporter asked Earnest late last month whether the president underestimated the Islamic State by referring to them as \u201cJV,\u201d Earnest said he had pulled the full quote and read it out loud: \u201c`I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\u2019\u201d\n\nEarnest added, \u201cSo the president was not singling out ISIL, he was talking about the very different threat that is posed by a range of extremists around the globe. Many of them do not have designs on attacking the West or attacking the United States, and that is what puts them in stark contrast to the goals and capability of the previously existing al Qaeda core network that was let by Osama bin Laden.\u201d\n\nBut Earnest\u2019s answer didn\u2019t put the interview in full context, Kessler said, referencing the New Yorker interview transcript.\n\nIn the interview, reporter David Remnick asked the president: \u201cEven in the period that you\u2019ve been on vacation in the last couple of weeks, in Iraq, in Syria, of course, in Africa, al Qaeda is resurgent.\u201d\n\nObama responded, \u201cYes, but, David, I think the analogy we use around here sometimes and I think is accurate is if a JV team puts on Lakers uniforms, that doesn\u2019t make them Kobe Bryant. I think there is a distinction between the capacity and reach of a bin Laden and a network that is actively planning major terrorist plots against the homeland versus jihadists who are engaged in various local power struggles and disputes, often sectarian.\u201d\n\nRemnick followed: \u201cBut that JV team jus[t] took over Fallujah.\u201d\n\nObama responded, \u201cI understand. But when you say took over Fallujah.\u201d\n\nReminck said, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t know for how long.\u201d\n\nObama said, \u201cBut let\u2019s just keep in mind, Fallujah is a profoundly conservative Sunni city in a country that, independent of anything we do, is deeply divided along sectarian lines. And how we think about terrorism has to be defined and specific enough that it doesn\u2019t lead us to think that any horrible actions that take place around the world that are motivated in part by an extremist Islamic ideology is a direct threat to us or something that we have to wade into.\u201d\n\nThe Washington Post Fact Checker argued that because of the references to Fallujah, it is clear the reporter and the president were speaking about the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThe New Yorker article does not specifically refer to ISIS but it is fairly clear in the article\u2014and certainly clear in the transcript\u2014that Remnick was asking about its takeover of Fallujah,\u201d Kessler wrote. \u201cBut the context of Remnick\u2019s question makes it clear that he was asking about ISIS, as the president acknowledged. Perhaps at the time the president viewed it as a local matter between jihadists, but now, eight months later, the United States is striking Islamic State targets in an effort to turn back its advance across Iraqi territory.\u201d\n\nThe Post said that Earnest did to respond to inquiries over a period of four days.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:15:19.912+0000", "event": "articles"}

During that time, violence escalated in Libya, including a June attack on the Benghazi consulate prior to the fatal September 11 attack.\n\nAbedin, Clinton\u2019s top aide, was also hired during that time period \u2014 at both the State Department and the Clinton Foundation.\n\nSpeaking to the Daily Beast, a State Department official said that only emails related to the security of the Benghazi consulate or U.S. diplomats in Libya were released to the House committee that is still investigating the attacks on Benghazi. According to Fox News, if that\u2019s true, than neither the Democratic frontrunner nor her staff communicated by email during that period \u2014 during which there were three attacks on international outposts in Benghazi, including one on the consulate.\n\nOn May 22, an International Red Cross office was struck by rocket-propelled grenades.\n\n\u201cThe attack on the International Red Cross was another attack that also involved us and threats to the compound there in Benghazi,\u201d Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Wood, a senior State Department security chief in Libya, testified before the House Oversight Committee in October 2012.\n\nAnother attack, on June 6, prompted the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli to warn of the \u201cfluid security situation in Libya,\u201d after an improvised explosive devise detonated outside of the consulate. It was then that Ambassador Chris Stevens, who was killed a few months later in the September attack, told his superiors that \u201cIslamic extremism appears to be on the rise in eastern Libya,\u201d according to Fox News.\n\nFive days later, two bodyguards were injured after a convoy carrying Britain\u2019s ambassador to Libya was hit with rocket-propelled grenades.\n\nDuring that time, Abedin was allowed to work both as a staff member for Clinton in the State Department and serve in a private role in Clinton and her husband\u2019s foundation. In 2013, the Associated Press filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the records of how she was able to obtain her special employment status.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that last week a federal judge gave State Department a final deadline of one week to fulfill the news organization\u2019s request. Just before midnight on Tuesday, narrowly making the deadline, lawyer\u2019s for the department submitted a declaration that identified almost 70 pages of \u201cpotentially responsive\u201d documents.\n\nAccording to the Daily Beast, this is the first time the State Department has acknowledged its two-year dispute with the Associated Press.\n\nHouse Republicans investigating the 2012 attack in Benghazi haven\u2019t missed the gaps in her emails, set to be released in batches, and have called it \u201cinexplicable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are gaps of months and months and months,\u201d Rep.Trey Gowdy (R-SC), chairman of the Select Committee on Benghazi, said in March.\n\n\u201cThe State Department transferred 300 messages exclusively reviewed and released by [Clinton\u2019s] own lawyers,\u201d he then said in May of the gaps in the emails. \u201cTo assume a self-selected public record is complete, when no one with a duty or responsibility to the public had the ability to take part in the selection, requires a leap in logic no impartial reviewer should be required to make and strains credibility.\u201d\n\nThe next release of Clinton\u2019s emails is tentatively scheduled for Friday.

A known commodity in the Biden world, Alcorn raised money for Joe Biden\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, and also served in the top fundraising role for Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid\u2019s vast political operation.\n\nWill Pierce, who runs the Draft Biden super PAC, said he was thrilled about Alcorn\u2019s move because Joe Biden\u2019s supporters throughout the U.S. \u201cknow how close he was to Beau and his family.\u201d\n\n\u201cJosh joining the Draft Biden effort only increases the serious nature of what to date has been an enormously successful effort,\u201d Pierce said late Sunday.\n\nAlcorn\u2019s decision to join the group marks the first clear sign that the close cadre of advisers surrounding the vice president may be taking the fledgling super PAC seriously. Until now, Biden\u2019s associates have eschewed any interaction with Draft Biden, which is staffed by volunteers and young operatives with few connections to Biden\u2019s inner circle.\n\nYet the group\u2019s stepped-up activity comes as Biden\u2019s associates are resuming discussions about a 2016 presidential run after largely shelving such deliberations while his son was sick and dying earlier this year.\n\nBiden has yet to tell his staff whether he will run or personally ask them to do any planning for a potential campaign, according to several people close to the vice president. But recent conversations between Biden\u2019s associates and Democratic donors and operatives have led to speculation that Biden will challenge front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton for the party\u2019s nomination. Individuals close to Biden have started looking into the options that might be available to him if he were to run, such as potential staff in Iowa and the filing deadlines for entering the Democratic field.\n\nStill, people close to the vice president say his launching a White House run remains uncertain. Biden is expected to make a final decision as soon as early September, according to those familiar with his plans. The individuals spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the deliberations publicly.\n\nThe renewed focus on Biden comes amid some signs of weakness for Clinton, including declines in her favorability ratings among voters in recent polling.

{"entityId": 1323, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose controversial career made him known as more of an agitator than a reconciler, has become the go-to man for the Obama White House not only on the fallout from the Ferguson, Missouri tragedy, but on all race matters, Politico Magazine reported.\n\nHere are three key items revealed by the publication about the close relationship between the reverend and the president, including why the White House has a \u201dtrust factor\u201d with Sharpton and why the Obama administration decided to \u201cbuild him up.\u201d\n\n1. What advice is Sharpton giving the White House on Ferguson?\n\nWhite House senior advisor Valerie Jarrett, perhaps the closest confidant of President Barack Obama, has been in consistent contact with Sharpton, according to Politico. Jarrett is staying in the Oak Bluff\u2019s section of Martha\u2019s Vineyard near where the Obama family is staying for their vacation. During various conversations Jarrett told Sharpton that Obama was \u201chorrified\u201d by the TV images of the unrest in Ferguson that erupted after a white police officer shot and killed an unarmed 18-year-old black man.\n\nJarrett would gather info from Sharpton and relay directly back to the president. The questions she reportedly asked were, \u201cHow bad was the violence? Was it being fueled by outside groups\u2014and could Sharpton do anything to talk them down? What did the Brown family want the White House to do?\u201d\n\nSharpton has told Jarrett that the White Hosue needs to lean on Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon to appoint a special prosecutor to replace St. Louis County prosecutor Bob McCulloch, who some activists have argued can\u2019t be objective in prosecuting the case against the police officer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to get a fair investigation with that guy, he\u2019s got to go,\u201d Sharpton told Jarrett, according to Politico.\n\n2. How did Sharpton go from being politically radioactive to having a \u2018trust factor\u2019 in the White House?\n\nSharpton is not only a frequent visitor to the White House, but he also frequently emails and texts Jarrett and Attorney General Eric Holder, who is also in Ferguson this week.\n\nThe article talks about Sharpton\u2019s reputation and how Democratic politicians \u2013 such as former President Bill Clinton \u2013 distanced themselves from him. This was for various protests and notably the Tawana Brawley case in the 1980s. The story said that Obama campaign aides also wanted their candidate to stay away from Sharpton in 2008.\n\nBut Sharpton tells Politico of Obama, \u201cHe realized I wasn\u2019t as irrational or as crazy as people thought.\u201d\n\nSharpton went on to say: \u201cI realized he was just a different kind of guy. \u2026 He wasn\u2019t going to be guided by emotions. He was not intimidated. There was no game you could play [with him]. The key for him was seeing that I wasn\u2019t insincere, that I actually believed in the stuff I was talking about.\u201d\n\nAn anonymous White House advisor told Poltico, \u201cThere\u2019s a trust factor with The Rev from the Oval Office on down.\u201d The official continued, \u201cHe gets it, and he\u2019s got credibility in the community that nobody else has got. There\u2019s really no one else out there who does what he does.\u201d\n\n3. Why Al Sharpton and not Jesse Jackson?\n\nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson was once the key civil rights leader and close to the Clinton White House. So why has his role been relegated? In part, it\u2019s personal, a White House official told Poltico.\n\nIt dates back to the hot mic moment in 2008 when Jackson was finishing up an interview.\n\n\u201cJesse wasn\u2019t an option for us. He had gotten too old\u2026 and Obama completely eclipsed him\u2014and then he had that hot-mic deal where [Jesse] said he wanted to cut [Obama\u2019s] balls off,\u201d the official told Poltico. \u201cBut there really was only one Jesse, and we needed to have someone to deal with in the African-American community, and Sharpton was the next best thing, so, yeah, we sort of helped build him up. \u2026 Sharpton was the last guy standing.\u201d\n\nSharpton said of Jackson, \u201cI\u2019ve come into my own and he\u2019s got to deal with it.\u201d\n\n\u201c[The relationship is] respectful but it\u2019s clearly not prot\u00e9g\u00e9-mentor,\u201d Sharpton added. \u201cI still admire what he did, I just think that things pass on. I\u2019m going to pass on\u2014everybody has their day.\u201d\n\nAt least on the record, Jackson is taking it in stride, telling Politico: \u201cI\u2019ve known Al since he was 12 years old, and he\u2019s arrived at the level he always wanted to arrive at, which is gratifying. He\u2019s the man who\u2019s the liaison to the White House, he\u2019s the one who\u2019s talking to the Justice Department.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:15:43.185+0000", "event": "articles"}

I believe in the power of millions of courageous conservatives rising up to reignite the promise of America,\u201d he said at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia. \u201cAnd that is why today, I am announcing that I\u2019m running for president of the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to you about the promise of America.\" Moments ago Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) launched his campaign to become president of the United States (PHOTO: @TheBlazeNow/ Amy Holmes) #TedCruz #TedCruz2016 #LibertyUniversity #CruzCrew A photo posted by @theblazenow on Mar 23, 2015 at 7:58am PDT\n\n\u201cIt is a time for truth,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cIt is a time for liberty. It is a time to reclaim the Constitution of the United States.\u201d\n\nCruz framed his campaign as part of an effort to restore the promise of America, which allows immigrants like his own parents to come to the United States and becoming whatever they want.\n\n\u201cThe answer will not come from Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will come only from the men and women across this country, from men and women, from people of faith, from lovers of liberty, from people who respect the Constitution.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will only come as it has come at every other time of challenge in this country \u2014 when the American people stand together and say we will get back to the principles that have made this country great,\u201d he added. \u201cWe will get back and restore that shining city on a hill that is the United States of America.\u201d\n\nHis remarks hit on many of the themes he has hit on for the last few years. Some of his biggest applause lines came from his promise to eliminate Obamacare and end President Barack Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\n\u201cImagine abolishing the IRS,\u201d he said to cheers. \u201cImagine embracing school choice as the civil rights issue of the next generation.\u201d\n\nBut one of the loudest applause lines was his call to imagine the U.S. being a better friend to Israel than Obama has been. \u201dInstead of a president who boycotts Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu, imagine a president who stands unapologetically with the nation of Israel,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz\u2019s decision to announce at Liberty University, the largest Christian university in the world, gave him a chance to stress the importance of faith. He recounted that his father \u2014 an immigrant from Cuba \u2014 left the family, then living in Canada, when Cruz was just 3, returning to Texas after deciding he didn\u2019t want to be married anymore. But he said his father discovered religion in Texas.\n\n\u201cAnd there, my father gave his life to Jesus Christ,\u201d Cruz said. His father, a pastor, ultimately returned home to the family.\n\n\u201cThere are people who wonder if faith is real,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you, in my family, there\u2019s not a second of doubt.\u201d He stressed to Christians around the country to come to the polls in 2016 and vote their values, and asked the audience to imagine a federal government that works to \u201cdefend the sanctity of human life.\u201d\n\nHis speech followed a late Sunday night announcement that said he was running, and the Monday morning release of a new video in which Cruz encouraged people to \u201cstand up and support our promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a new generation of courageous conservatives to help make America great again,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m ready to stand with you to lead the fight.\u201d\n\nWith the announcement, Cruz is the first nationally known candidate for 2016. A few other Republicans, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, have formed exploratory committees and are expected to declare one way or the other in the coming weeks and months.\n\nCruz\u2019s announcement seems designed to seize the official status as frontrunner while he can, a head start he may need against other Republicans that are expected to enter the race. The most recent polls have him trailing Bush, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, author and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.\n\nCruz has also polled at roughly the same levels as fellow Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).\n\nStill, Cruz is arguably the Republican in Congress most identified with the GOP\u2019s opposition to President Barack Obama. He\u2019s been at the forefront of efforts in Congress to repeal Obamacare, and fight Obama\u2019s executive action on immigration.\n\nOn immigration, Cruz will likely find himself fighting those in his own party, including Bush, who have a more moderate stance on the issue. And Cruz\u2019s opposition within the Republican Party is already well-funded \u2014 Bush is easily the biggest money-raiser so far of all the possible GOP candidates.\n\nCruz has hinted that his strategy will be to pull together fiscal conservatives, those who prioritize defense and national security, and those on the religious right.\n\nWhile Cruz and Obama have almost nothing in common policy-wise, Cruz is hoping to emulate Obama\u2019s path to the White House. Obama became president just four years after he first became a U.S. senator \u2014 two years short of a full six-year term \u2014 and rose to power largely on strength of his criticisms of the incumbent president.\n\nA Cruz victory in 2016 would match that feat, and his attempt will likely be filled with reminders of what Cruz has said are Obama numerous foreign and domestic policy failures.\n\nDuring his first year in the Senate in 2013, he quickly won the hearts of conservatives by launching a filibuster on the Senate floor to protest Obamacare. He said dramatically that he would talk until he is \u201cno longer able to stand,\u201d and ended more than 21 hours later.\n\nLate last year, Cruz urged senators to vote against a $1.1 trillion spending bill that funded most of the government for the rest of fiscal year 2015. Cruz and other Republicans warned that the idea of only giving the Department of Homeland Security temporary funding, in the hopes of forcing Democrats to agree to defund President Barack Obama\u2019s immigration plan, would backfire, since the GOP would be seen as taking DHS hostage.\n\nBy March, Cruz was proven right, as Republican leaders in the House and Senate were forced to drop their fight against Obama\u2019s immigration plan and pass a \u201cclean\u201d DHS bill. In the end, 75 House Republicans agreed to pass the clean bill.\n\nMore recently, he has joined with other Republicans to criticize Obama\u2019s ongoing effort to strike a nuclear agreement with Iran.", "score": 3, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:15:44.230+0000", "event": "articles"}

The story was later revised to show the referral wasn\u2019t criminal and the emails, not Clinton herself, were the target.\n\nClinton campaign communications director Jennifer Palmieri wrote, \u201cwe remain perplexed by the Times\u2019 slowness to acknowledge its errors after the fact, and some of the shaky justifications that Times\u2019 editors have made.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish to emphasize our genuine wish to have a constructive relationship with The New York Times,\u201d the letter continued. \u201cBut we also are extremely troubled by the events that went into this erroneous report, and will be looking forward to discussing our concerns related to this incident so we can have confidence that it is not repeated in the future.\u201d\n\nThe campaign sent the letter to New York Times executive editor Dean Baquet on Tuesday, and made the letter public Thursday.\n\nA Times spokeswoman said Thursday night that \u201cour editor\u2019s note and the public editor fully addressed the issues related to this story and we don\u2019t plan to comment further,\u201d CNN reported.\n\nIf you wish, you can read the full text of the lengthy letter below:\n\nDean Baquet\n\nExecutive Editor\n\nThe New York Times\n\n620 Eighth Avenue\n\nNew York, New York\n\nJuly 28, 2015\n\nDear Mr. Baquet:\n\nI am writing to officially register our campaign\u2019s grave concern with the Times\u2019 publication of an inaccurate report related to Hillary Clinton and her email use.\n\nI appreciate the fact that both you and the Public Editor have sought to publicly explain how this error could have been made. But we remain perplexed by the Times\u2019 slowness to acknowledge its errors after the fact, and some of the shaky justifications that Times\u2019 editors have made. We feel it important to outline these concerns with you directly so that they may be properly addressed and so our campaign can continue to have a productive working relationship with the Times.\n\nI feel obliged to put into context just how egregious an error this story was. The New York Times is arguably the most important news outlet in the world and it rushed to put an erroneous story on the front page charging that a major candidate for President of the United States was the target of a criminal referral to federal law enforcement. Literally hundreds of outlets followed your story, creating a firestorm that had a deep impact that cannot be unwound. This problem was compounded by the fact that the Times took an inexplicable, let alone indefensible, delay in correcting the story and removing \u201ccriminal\u201d from the headline and text of the story.\n\nTo review the facts, as the Times itself has acknowledged through multiple corrections, the paper\u2019s reporting was false in several key respects: first, contrary to what the Times stated, Mrs. Clinton is not the target of a criminal referral made by the State Department\u2019s and Intelligence Community\u2019s Inspectors General, and second, the referral in question was not of a criminal nature at all.\n\nJust as disturbing as the errors themselves is the Times\u2019 apparent abandonment of standard journalistic practices in the course of its reporting on this story.\n\nFirst, the seriousness of the allegations that the Times rushed to report last Thursday evening demanded far more care and due diligence than the Times exhibited prior to this article\u2019s publication.\n\nThe Times\u2019 readers rightfully expect the paper to adhere to the most rigorous journalistic standards. To state the obvious, it is hard to imagine a situation more fitting for those standards to be applied than when a newspaper is preparing to allege that a major party candidate for President of the United States is the target of a criminal referral received by federal law enforcement.\n\nThis allegation, however, was reported hastily and without affording the campaign adequate opportunity to respond. It was not even mentioned by your reporter when our campaign was first contacted late Thursday afternoon. Initially, it was stated as reporting only on a memo \u2013 provided to Congress by the Inspectors General from the State Department and Intelligence Community \u2013 that raised the possibility of classified material traversing Secretary Clinton\u2019s email system. This memo \u2014 which was subsequently released publicly \u2014 did not reference a criminal referral at all. It was not until late Thursday night \u2013 at 8:36 pm \u2013 that your paper hurriedly followed up with our staff to explain that it had received a separate tip that the Inspectors General had additionally made a criminal referral to the Justice Department concerning Clinton\u2019s email use. Our staff indicated that we had no knowledge of any such referral \u2013 understandably, of course, since none actually existed \u2013 and further indicated that, for a variety of reasons, the reporter\u2019s allegation seemed implausible. Our campaign declined any immediate comment, but asked for additional time to attempt to investigate the allegation raised. In response, it was indicated that the campaign \u201chad time,\u201d suggesting the publication of the report was not imminent.\n\nDespite the late hour, our campaign quickly conferred and confirmed that we had no knowledge whatsoever of any criminal referral involving the Secretary. At 10:36 pm, our staff attempted to reach your reporters on the phone to reiterate this fact and ensure the paper would not be going forward with any such report. There was no answer. At 10:54 pm, our staff again attempted calling. Again, no answer. Minutes later, we received a call back. We sought to confirm that no story was imminent and were shocked at the reply: the story had just published on the Times\u2019 website.\n\nThis was, to put it mildly, an egregious breach of the process that should occur when a major newspaper like the Times is pursuing a story of this magnitude. Not only did the Times fail to engage in a proper discussion with the campaign ahead of publication; given the exceedingly short window of time between when the Times received the tip and rushed to publish, it hardly seems possible that the Times conducted sufficient deliberations within its own ranks before going ahead with the story.\n\nSecond, in its rush to publish what it clearly viewed as a major scoop, the Times relied on questionable sourcing and went ahead without bothering to seek corroborating evidence that could have supported its allegation.\n\nIn our conversations with the Times reporters, it was clear that they had not personally reviewed the IG\u2019s referral that they falsely described as both criminal and focused on Hillary Clinton. Instead, they relied on unnamed sources that characterized the referral as such. However, it is not at all clear that those sources had directly seen the referral, either. This should have represented too many \u201cdegrees of separation\u201d for any newspaper to consider it reliable sourcing, least of all The New York Times.\n\nTimes\u2019 editors have attempted to explain these errors by claiming the fault for the misreporting resided with a Justice Department official whom other news outlets cited as confirming the Times\u2019 report after the fact. This suggestion does not add up. It is our understanding that this Justice Department official was not the original source of the Times\u2019 tip. Moreover, notwithstanding the official\u2019s inaccurate characterization of the referral as criminal in nature, this official does not appear to have told the Times that Mrs. Clinton was the target of that referral, as the paper falsely reported in its original story.\n\nThis raises the question of what other sources the Times may have relied on for its initial report. It clearly was not either of the referring officials \u2013 that is, the Inspectors General of either the State Department or intelligence agencies \u2013 since the Times\u2019 sources apparently lacked firsthand knowledge of the referral documents. It also seems unlikely the source could have been anyone affiliated with those offices, as it defies logic that anyone so closely involved could have so severely garbled the description of the referral.\n\nOf course, the identity of the Times\u2019 sources would be deserving of far less scrutiny if the underlying information had been confirmed as true. However, the Times appears to have performed little, if any, work to corroborate the accuracy of its sources\u2019 characterizations of the IG\u2019s referral. Key details went uninvestigated in the Times\u2019 race to publish these erroneous allegations against Mrs. Clinton. For instance, high in the Times\u2019 initial story, the reporters acknowledged they had no knowledge of whether or not the documents that the Times claimed were mishandled by Mrs. Clinton contained any classified markings. In Mrs. Clinton\u2019s case, none of the emails at issue were marked. This fact was quickly acknowledged by the IC inspector general\u2019s office within hours of the Times\u2019 report, but it was somehow left unaddressed in the initial story.\n\nEven after the Times\u2019 reporting was revealed to be false, the Times incomprehensibly delayed the issuance of a full and true correction.\n\nOur campaign first sought changes from the Times as soon as the initial story was published. Recognizing the implausibility that Mrs. Clinton herself could be the subject of any criminal probe, we immediately challenged the story\u2019s opening line, which said the referral sought an investigation into Mrs. Clinton specifically for the mishandling of classified materials. In response, the Times\u2019 reporters admitted that they themselves had never seen the IG\u2019s referral, and so acknowledged the possibility that the paper was overstating what it directly knew when it portrayed the potential investigation as centering on Mrs. Clinton. It corrected the lead sentence accordingly.\n\nThe speed with which the Times conceded that it could not defend its lead citing Mrs. Clinton as the referral\u2019s target raises questions about what inspired its confidence in the first place to frame the story that way. More importantly, the Times\u2019 change was not denoted in the form of a correction. Rather, it was performed quietly, overnight, without any accompanying note to readers. This was troubling in its lack of transparency and risks causing the Times to appear like it is trying to whitewash its misreporting. A correction should have been posted promptly that night.\n\nRegardless, even after this change, a second error remained in the story: the characterization of the referral as criminal at all. By Friday morning, multiple members of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (who had been briefed by the Inspectors General) challenged this portrayal\u2014and ultimately, so did the Department of Justice itself. Only then did the Times finally print a correction acknowledging its misstatement of the nature of the referral to the Justice Department.\n\nOf course, the correction, coming as it did on a Friday afternoon, was destined to reach a fraction of those who read the Times\u2019 original, erroneous report. As the Huffington Post observed:\n\n\u201c\u2026it\u2019s unlikely that the same audience will see the updated version unless the paper were to send out a second breaking news email with its latest revisions. The Clinton story also appeared [on] the front page of Friday\u2019s print edition.\u201d\n\nMost maddening of all, even after the correction fixed the description of the referral within the story, a headline remained on the front page of the Times\u2019 website that read, \u201cCriminal Inquiry is Sought in Clinton Email Account.\u201d It was not until even later in the evening that the word \u201ccriminal\u201d was finally dropped from the headline and an updated correction was issued to the story. The lateness of this second correction, however, prevented it from appearing in the paper the following morning. We simply do not understand how that was allowed to occur.\n\nLastly, the Times\u2019 official explanations for the misreporting is profoundly unsettling.\n\nIn a statement to the Times\u2019 public editor, you said that the errors in the Times\u2019 story Thursday night were \u201cunavoidable.\u201d This is hard to accept. As noted above, the Justice Department official that incorrectly confirmed the Times\u2019 initial reports for other outlets does not appear to have been the initial source for the Times. Moreover, it is precisely because some individuals may provide erroneous information that it is important for the Times to sift the good information from the bad, and where there is doubt, insist on additional evidence. The Times was under no obligation to go forward on a story containing such explosive allegations coming only from sources who refused to be named. If nothing else, the Times could have allowed the campaign more time to understand the allegation being engaged. Unfortunately, the Times chose to take none of these steps.\n\nIn closing, I wish to emphasize our genuine wish to have a constructive relationship with The New York Times. But we also are extremely troubled by the events that went into this erroneous report, and will be looking forward to discussing our concerns related to this incident so we can have confidence that it is not repeated in the future.\n\nSincerely,\n\nJennifer Palmieri\n\nCommunications Director\n\nHillary for America\n\nCc: Margaret Sullivan,\n\nPublic Editor\n\nNew York Times", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:15:57.873+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1342, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "President Barack Obama will face down the final two years of his presidency with Republican majorities in the House and Senate \u2014 which means he\u2019ll have to compromise with the opposition, or risk looking like the kind of obstructionist he\u2019s painted members of the GOP as.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama has not given any signals one way or the other,\u201d Stephen Voss, political science professor at the University of Kentucky told TheBlaze Wednesday. \u201cWhen he and [Democratic Senate leader] Harry Reid could tag team, they would not play ball. There are a few signals that Obama understand the realities and will want to protect his own legacy. He is more worried about how the history books view him than how the electorate views him.\u201d\n\nVoss said there\u2019s room for Obama to make deals with the GOP, including tax reforms that get rid of loopholes in exchange for lower rates, or some form of immigration reform that is heavy on border enforcement. Voss said he expects Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to try to reach agreements.\n\n\u201cHe gave a conciliatory victory speech,\u201d Voss said of McConnell, who as Senate minority leader is expected to rise to the position of majority leader. \u201cHe is in a career stage where he is thinking about his legacy. He will likely reach out if the White House is willing to play ball.\u201d\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 victory has all but quashed Obama\u2019s push for stricter gun control laws, a federal minimum wage hike, universal preschool, tax increases for higher income earners and restriction on campaign spending \u2014 proposals he still couldn\u2019t get through under a Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nWhat could be on the table, analysts said, is the extension of the Keystone XL pipeline, a GOP-backed proposal that has bipartisan support; nominal debt reduction; and expansion of presidential trade authority.\n\n\u201cThat will be a great bone to throw to union labor and it will look like he is not rejecting every bill Congress sends him,\u201d Richard Kelsey, assistant dean of the George Mason University School of Law, said of the Keystone pipeline. \u201cBut he will block any legislation that affects his overarching progressive agenda.\u201d\n\nStill others predict that Obama will focus more on executive action, and are not optimistic about the passage of substantive legislation to solve big national problems like the debt.\n\nWhat could be markedly different from the previous four years is that a Democrat-controlled Senate will no longer be able to block every bill passed by the Republican-controlled House.\n\nSenate Democrats can still filibuster, but McConnell has said he would try to move some bills through that require only 51 votes. As majority leader, Reid led rule changes to make the Senate more of a majoritarian body, rules that McConnell isn\u2019t likely to roll back in his new role.\n\nThis means Obama will be faced with signing or vetoing legislation, which could put a president that has accused the other side of being the \u201cparty of no\u201d in a precarious position.\n\n\u201cNow Republicans are viewed as the obstructionist party, but if Republicans are able to advance an agenda and Obama opposes it, the Democrats will be seen as the party of obstructionism,\u201d said Gary Rose, a political science professor at Sacred Heart University.\n\nWho gets blamed for obstruction will be based on how well the parties spin the argument, said Geoffrey Skelley, an editor for the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics.\n\n\u201cIt could come down to communication,\u201d Skelley said. \u201cIf the president ends up vetoing a number of bills, he will either be viewed as the last line of defense or the leader of the party of no.\u201d\n\nBut Obama could seek to avoid Congress altogether and focus on international affairs or take executive action on matters like immigration reform, Kelsey of George Mason University said.\n\n\u201cI think he will create executive amnesty and force a food fight among Republicans,\u201d Kelsey said. \u201cI think he will keep taking executive actions and try to force the Republicans to talk impeachment and use that to his political benefit.\u201d\n\nThe day before the elections, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama was prepared to negotiate with whichever party controlled Congress.\n\n\u201cRegardless of who\u2019s in the control of the Senate, this administration is going to continue to strongly advocate for policies that benefit middle-class families all across the country,\u201d Earnest told reporters. \u201cAnd the administration is going to retain a willingness to work with anybody in either party who shares that commitment.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s possible a Republican Senate could bring Obama to the negotiating table, similar to how GOP control moved President Bill Clinton to the center in the \u201990s, it\u2019s no certainty, said Edward Yager, a political science professor at Western Kentucky University.\n\n\u201cAlthough in 1994 Republican control of Congress prompted Clinton to triangulate, Obama may resist the perception that he was \u2018forced\u2019 to the bipartisan bargaining table late in his term and especially with declining public support for his presidency,\u201d Yager told TheBlaze. \u201cHow might that look for his legacy?

Mike Huckabee said the Iran nuclear deal holds real danger not just for Israel, but for the United States as well.\n\nVisiting Israel this week to meet with political and business leaders and to fundraise, the Republican presidential candidate told TheBlaze by phone Tuesday that Iran\u2019s leadership has hardly been secretive about their ultimate goal.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve already said they want to wipe Israel off the face of the map,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cI think what a lot of Americans don\u2019t understand is Israel is the opening act, but the main event is America.\u201d\n\nTo emphasize his point, Huckabee noted Iran\u2019s continued description of the U.S. as the \u201cGreat Satan,\u201d while Israel is their \u201csmall target.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve not been subtle or coy about it. You have to take people seriously when they say they\u2019re going to kill you,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\nAtypically for an American politician, Huckabee traveled Tuesday evening to the Jewish community of Shiloh, located in Judea and Samaria, commonly known as the West Bank. He was attending a fundraiser with U.S. citizens, including those who live in Israel.\n\n\u201cI think that it\u2019s important for Americans to visit in Judea and Samaria and understand that this is very much an important part of Israel\u2019s future,\u201d Huckabee said.\n\n\u201cI think sometimes a lot of Americans hear terms like \u2018West Bank\u2019 and \u2018settlements,\u2019\u201d he continued. \u201cI don\u2019t refer to it as the \u2018West Bank\u2019 \u2014 it\u2019s Judea and Samaria, it\u2019s a part of Israel. These are neighborhoods. \u2018Settlements\u2019 sound very temporary.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world has, I think, completely misrepresented how important these areas are for Israel\u2019s security,\u201d he said.\n\nMany Israelis have pointed to the danger to their security in handing the West Bank to the Palestinians, citing the experience of withdrawing from Gaza in 2005, only to see the Islamist Hamas terrorist group come to power and having thousands of rockets fired into Israel.\n\nWhile security is one argument for leaving Israel in control of the territory not already given to the Palestinians under the 1993 Oslo Accords, another is Jewish biblical heritage.\n\nHuckabee\u2019s campaign website makes reference to this connection: \u201cSadly, this administration spends more time berating Israel for building houses in the lands given to Abraham than telling the Iranians to stop building bombs pointed at us.\u201d\n\nYisrael Medad, who writes the blog My Right Word from Shiloh, said he views Huckabee\u2019s visit as an affirmation of the links of the Jewish people to their biblical homeland, including Judea and Samaria, which is not recognized as belonging to Israel by most of the world.\n\n\u201cThe presence of Governor Huckabee at the ancient site of Shiloh, which has a history extending back over 3,500 years, where the first permanent institutions of government and religious worship in the land of Israel were established, is yet another confirmation of the narrative of the strong national and cultural and legal links between the Jewish people and its homeland,\u201d Medad, who has lived in Shiloh for 30 years, told TheBlaze.\n\nSituated in Samaria, north of Jerusalem, Shiloh appears several times in the Bible, including in the book of Joshua, as the site where the tabernacle was erected and where the Israelite tribes were given their allotted portions in the promised land. In 1 Samuel, it is also noted as the place the prophet Samuel was inducted into his ministry.\n\nHuckabee tweeted that he ran into \u201cDuck Dynasty\u201d star Willie Robertson while in Israel.

Rudman Distinguished Public Service Award.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t mean bribery. I really don\u2019t mean that, but it\u2019s awfully, awfully difficult to go to Wall Street and talk about tax cuts that help the middle class when they are the very guys whose interest is not to see that happen, and they are funding your campaign. It\u2019s not just Wall Street; labor, any group,\u201d Biden continues as he was fighting off a cold. \u201cGoing forward, we need a different way. We need leaders with the courage to stand up to this mountain of money. We need voters who will stand with these leaders willing to take it on. What we need to do is give our people a fighting chance, an opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cFighting chance\u201d is coincidentally the title of the book by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), whom many on the left want to see challenge Clinton for the nomination. Warren has repeatedly said she won\u2019t run.\n\nThis month alone, Biden has traveled to Iowa, where the first presidential caucus will be held, and to South Carolina, where the first southern primary is held.\n\nBiden is not doing well in most polls now, but that could change, said Andrew Smith, director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.\n\n\u201cBeing in the mix is important for anyone thinking about running,\u201d Smith told TheBlaze. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what will happen. If Hillary does run, as it appears she will, it\u2019s likely she will win the nomination, but until she is in the race, you will see other people keep there names out in the press by showing up in New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nSmith added that like previous vice presidents such as Al Gore and George H.W. Bush, it\u2019s not difficult to come to early states for official business.\n\n\u201cFor Joe Biden, as vice president, it doesn\u2019t cost him anything to travel to New Hampshire, and should Hillary Clinton opt out, he would be ready to flip the switch,\u201d Smith added. \u201cThe Citizens United decision has made it easier that you don\u2019t have to have a massive campaign infrastructure in place to raise money.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gary Rose, political science professor at Sacred Heart University, believes the lack of campaign fundraising will be a problem.\n\n\u201cHe is seriously considering running, but polls aren\u2019t showing a lot of interest in Joe Biden,\u201d Rose told TheBlaze. \u201cIf he\u2019s serious about running, he would need a leadership PAC and a super PAC. He seems to be testing the waters and seeing if he could make a credible run. Ultimately, the Clinton machine is so formidable.\u201d\n\nAt Biden\u2019s second stop, speaking at Manchester Community College, he said the administration hoped to cover price tag of free community college by closing a tax loophole.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s expensive. It\u2019s about $8 billion a year for totally free community college across the nation. But guess what? We\u2019ll spend $221 billion over the next 10 years making sure people that make up less than four-tenths of 1 percent of the population are able to not have to pay capital gains,\u201d Biden said.\n\nBiden then went on to explain that closing a loophole in inherited investment would only affect the wealthy, which the website FactCheck.org called misleading in a tweet, referring to a similar claim by President Barack Obama, pointing out that such a tax hike could affect more than just the highest earners.\n\n\u201cSo the way we pay for this is, we pay for it by eliminating this tax loophole.

Kobach is optimistic about the bill passing in a Republican legislature and getting the signature of Republican Gov. Sam Brownback.\n\nKobach, who before taking office in Kansas was an author of the Arizona immigration law, said he has consulted lawmakers from a dozen other states about legislation to confront Obama\u2019s executive action.\n\n\u201cThis is a true constitutional crisis we are in now,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cThe executive branch has seized power from Congress and ordered federal agents to disobey federal law. We need to see elements acting in this, and they are. The states, the courts and Congress are asserting themselves. If the executive branch gets away with this, it would leave in tatters our constitutional system.\u201d\n\nThe bill that Kobach submitted to the state Senate would specifically not provide drivers licenses to anyone in the country illegally \u2013 even if they are given what amounts to legal status under the Obama executive actions. Further, the Kansas bill would ban work authorization for illegals, even if they were assisted by Obama\u2019s action. Finally, employers would not be allowed to deduct state taxes from the wages of illegal immigrants they hire.\n\n\u201cWe do not need to recognize this illegal amnesty as affecting Kansas,\u201d Kobach said.\n\nHe said it does more than just uphold what the status quo would have been before the Obama action in November.\n\n\u201cWhen an alien is illegal here and they get a false Social Security number and try to use it to get a driver\u2019s license, it is checked against the federal SAVE system at the DMV,\u201d Kobach said. \u201cNow, under Obama\u2019s order, those with legal status, almost all will be getting a Social Security number. They will not be able use that to get a driver\u2019s license legally here\u201d if the bill passes.\n\nThe Obama administration sued the state of Arizona after it passed a law to allow police to ask people about their immigration status. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld most key provisions of Arizona\u2019s law. Kobach said he didn\u2019t know whether Kansas should expect blow back from the administration if it passes the bill.\n\n\u201cThis is the first administration I know of that has tried to punish states for trying to enforce federal immigration law,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would be a defensive action by a state.

Mary Fallin signed a bill to allow judges to impose shorter sentences for nonviolent offenses, while also sending some offenders to treatment instead of jail.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan Senate bill introduced in February supported by some of the most conservative Republicans and some of the most liberal Democrats is languishing in the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\u201cThe president did convene a meeting with Democrats and Republicans in both the House and the Senate in the Cabinet Room to discuss this very issue,\u201d White House press secretary Josh Earnest told TheBlaze Wednesday. \u201cThis is something the president believes would be important to addressing some concerns about inequities in the way the law is enforced.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe president has been gratified that both Democrats and Republicans recognized that this is a priority and that putting in place these kinds of reforms would be good for the country,\u201d Earnest continued. \u201cThe president certainly is interested and willing in working with Democrats or Republicans, with anybody on either side of the aisle that understands why this is an important step for our country to take.\u201d\n\nEarnest said he was not aware of the new Oklahoma law.\n\nAccording to the Daily Oklahoman, the Justice Safety Valve Act takes effect Nov. 1 and allows judges to depart from mandatory minimum sentencing laws and instead send nonviolent criminals for treatment for mental health or drug abuse problems. Fallin told the newspaper that one in 11 Oklahomans serve time in prison under current law, and that under the new law, violent criminals will continue to be incarcerated.\n\nIn February, Sens. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Dick Durin (D-Ill.) introduced a similar bill for federal prisons called the \u201cSmarter Sentencing Act.\u201d They were joined in their announcement by Sens.

The Clinton Foundation website lists the company as a donor who gave between $10,001 to $25,000.\n\nAdditionally, the website for Balli Real Estate, a property investment and development subsidiary based in Britain, says that Alaghband is a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nFrom the Daily Beast:\n\nThe company pleaded guilty to two counts of criminal information in 2010. In its plea agreement with the Department of Justice, Balli Aviation agreed to pay a $2 million criminal fine, serve five years corporate probation, and pay an additional $15 million in civil fines. The hefty sum was \u201ca direct consequence of the level of deception used to mislead investigators,\u201d Thomas Madigan, a top Justice Department official, said at the time. Alaghband is one of an array of questionable actors who\u2019ve been found in recent months to give to the Clinton Foundation. The gifts \u2013 from foreign governments with human rights violations like Qatar, Algeria, Saudi Arabia and China as well as FIFA, soccer\u2019s corrupt governing body \u2013 have complicated Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign for president and raised questions as to whether these entities were trying to curry favor with the former Secretary of State. But Alaghband stands out from the rest, because the beneficiary of his firm\u2019s deals with Tehran was an Iranian airline accused by the U.S. government of working with the regime\u2019s foreign intelligence operatives and shipping arms and troops to Syria. Plus, if an agreement between Iran and the world\u2019s major powers is concluded in the coming days \u2013 as is widely expected \u2013 operators like Alaghband could stand to benefit. Hillary Clinton will be put in the awkward position of either defending the act of the Obama administration in which she once served or criticizing the culmination of a U.S.-Iran rapprochement effort, which her State Department began.\n\nInterestingly, Alaghband, told the Daily Beast, \u201cI am not a member of the Clinton Global Initiative.\u201d\n\n\u201cI attended a few meetings. The last meeting was 10 years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t recall having ever made a contribution.\u201d\n\nAs to why his own corporate website listed him as a member, he said: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen this website recently. If attending a few meetings makes you a member, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nA source close to the Clinton Foundation told the Daily Beast that Alaghband \u201cwas never a member of CGI in a personal capacity,\u201d but added, \u201cIn 2007, Balli Group paid a onetime CGI membership fee and they designated him as their delegate to the meeting.\u201d\n\nOne of the charges against Balli Aviation was that it \u201cconspired to export three Boeing 747 aircraft from the United States to Iran,\u201d without obtaining the necessary export licenses from the U.S. government, according to a Justice Department statement reported by the Daily Beast. It further used an U.S. airline subsidiary to buy 747s with financing from the Iranian-based Mahan Air \u2013 a company the State Department sais is controlled by former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani.

However, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday night blocked Wisconsin from implementing a law requiring voters to present photo IDs.\n\nGonzales Ramos, an appointee of President Barack Obama, never signaled during a two-week trial in September that she intended to rule on the Texas law \u2014 rebuked as the toughest of its kind in the U.S. \u2014 before Election Day. But the timing could spare an estimated 13.6 million registered Texas voters from needing one of seven kinds of photos identification to cast a ballot.\n\nThe Justice Department says more than 600,000 of those voters, mostly blacks and Hispanics, currently lack any eligible ID to vote.\n\nGonzales Ramos\u2019 ruling says the law \u201ccreates an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote, has an impermissible discriminatory effect against Hispanics and African-Americans, and was imposed with an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose.\u201d It added that the measure: \u201cconstitutes an unconstitutional poll tax.\u201d\n\nRepublican Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott\u2019s office said it would appeal.\n\n\u201cThe State of Texas will immediately appeal and will urge the Fifth Circuit to resolve this matter quickly to avoid voter confusion in the upcoming election,\u201d said Lauren Bean, a spokeswoman for Abbott\u2019s office.\n\nEarly voting is scheduled to begin Monday, Oct. 20.\n\nSherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said, \u201cThe Court today effectively ruled that racial discrimination simply cannot spread to the ballot box.\u201d\n\nNineteen states have laws requiring voters to show identification at the polls. Courts across the country have knocked down challenges \u2014 including at the U.S. Supreme Court \u2014 but the Texas case attracted unusual attention from U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder.\n\nHe brought the weight of his office into Texas after the Supreme Court last year struck down the heart of the Voting Rights Act, which had prohibited the state from enacting its voter ID law signed by Republican Gov. Rick Perry in 2011. Democrats and minority rights groups joined the Justice Department in the lawsuit.\n\nThe full Voting Rights Act had blocked Texas and eight other states with histories of discrimination from changing election laws without permission from the DOJ or a federal court. Holder vowed to wring whatever protections he could from the new and weakened version, and made Texas a first target.\n\nBut prevailing in court required proving intentional discrimination, and Texas maintained that opponents produced no evidence.\n\nThe office of Abbott, who is favored to win the race to replace Perry as governor, said minorities and whites alike supported the law in public opinion polls. It also pointed to other states, such as Georgia and Indiana, where the similar measures have been upheld.\n\nBut opponents slammed Texas\u2019 law as far more discriminatory. College students IDs aren\u2019t accepted by poll workers, but concealed handgun licenses are. Free voting IDs offered by the state require a birth certificate that costs little as $3, but the Justice Department argued that traveling to get those documents imposes an outsize burden on poor minorities.\n\nAs a result, opponents say, Texas has issued fewer than 300 free voter IDs since the law took effect. Georgia, meanwhile, has issued 2,200 voter IDs under a similar program with more robust outreach.\n\nTexas has already conducted two smaller statewide elections under voter ID, in which no widespread issues were reported", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:16:40.201+0000", "event": "articles"}

For Jarrett using the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole to save about $200,000 on her tax bill from about $1.85 million profit, according to the group\u2019s findings.\n\nBetter Government Association President Andy Shaw responded in Sunday op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times to Jarrett defenders, who he said reacted in a \u201cso what\u201d matter to the group\u2019s investigation first published in June.\n\n\u201cSo, on one hand she\u2019s arguing against the \u2018carried interest\u2019 loophole, as Obama did in a tough TV ad against 2012 Republican rival Mitt Romney,\u201d Shaw wrote Sunday. \u201cOn the other hand she\u2019s profiting from the same tax break. That\u2019s the \u2018what.\u2019 Disingenuous? Unethical? Conflict of interest? Legitimate questions watchdogs ask every day.\u201d\n\nShaw was referring to a 2012 attack ad against Romney, which said, \u201cTax havens, offshore accounts and carried interest, Mitt Romney has used every trick in the book.\u201d\n\nThe BGA is an investigative journalism group that focuses primarily in Illinois matters, and does not appear to have outward political leanings. The organization, which has won reporting awards from the Associated Press, spent months on the Jarrett investigation.\n\nShaw noted that Jarrett defenders insisted taking advantage of the loophole was not illegal. His Sun-Times op-ed argues, \u201cMaybe so, but consider that:\u201d\n\n+ Beginning in 2010, Jarrett helped the Obama administration push for the elimination of a tax loophole that benefits wealthy developers and investors. + Five years later, the White House effort still hasn\u2019t been successful. + Jarrett, however, has been very successful personally, profiting handsomely in 2013 on her `05 real estate investment, then cutting her 2013 tax liability in half by privately taking advantage of the same loophole she was fighting publicly\u2026 So how might Jarrett have handled the situation differently? + Recuse herself from the administration\u2019s attempt to eliminate the loophole. + Not use it herself. + Disclose the details publicly after deciding to benefit from the tax break. There\u2019s no indication she did any of the above.\n\nBefore working in the Obama White House, Jarrett was an executive at the Habitat Company, a Chicago real estate development firm, where she helped develop a 46-story apartment tower called Kingsbury Plaza. The tower was owned under the name Grand Kingsbury LLC.\n\nThe managing partner of the development was a Habitat offshoot called Habitat Grand Kingsbury LLC, co-owned by Jarrett and other Habitat executives. The offshoot owned 20 percent of the development. The GE pension fund owned the other 80 percent of the development. Of that 20 percent, Jarrett had a 10.67 percent share, according to the Better Government Association.\n\nThe Kingsbury Plaza was sold in 2013, with GE getting $67.2 million. Meanwhile the Habitat partners received $17.4 million, according to the BGA. Cook County, Illinois land records show that Jarrett\u2019s share of the sale proceeds was $1.85 million, according to BGA.\n\nJarrett disclosed the earnings in her White House financial disclosure form, checking the $1 million to $5 million category on the form for earnings. Habitat President Matthew Fiascone told the BGA that the partners, including Jarrett, received a carried interest in the deal. Earnings of more than $1 million would be tax discount of $200,000, according to the BGA\u2019s calculations based on land a mortgage records.\n\nIn response to to the BGA, the White House sent TheBlaze three examples of Jarrett speaking in favor of reforming the tax code to do away with loopholes.\n\nDuring a speech at a Bloomberg News breakfast during the 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, she called for closing loopholes. A year earlier, during a Sept. 19, 2011 interview with National Public Radio, she said, \u201cLet\u2019s not have all these old loopholes that were created by special interest groups. So, this about fairness. It\u2019s about equity. It\u2019s about balance.\u201d She made a similar point earlier that month during an MSNBC interview.\n\nObama has called on Congress to eliminate the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole in every budget he submitted, and put forward a tax reform proposal that included the elimination of the loophole.\n\nThe phrase \u201ccarried interest\u201d refers to when income from investment is taxed at the capital gains rate of 20 percent, or about half of 39.6 percent of the top income tax rate. Hedge fund and real estate industries are among those that benefit.\n\nIn May, Obama also talked about the tax loophole.\n\n\u201cWhen I, for example, make an argument about closing the carried interest loophole that exists whereby hedge fund managers are paying 15 percent on the fees and income that they collect, I\u2019ve been called Hitler for doing this, or at least this is like Hitler going into Poland,\u201d Obama said. \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not saying that because I dislike hedge fund managers or I think they\u2019re evil. I\u2019m saying that you\u2019re paying a lower rate than a lot of folks who are making $300,000 a year.

The revenue will be used to pay for an estimated $235 billion in tax credits for low- and middle-income earners.\n\nHe framed the policy in broad terms, using the phrase \u201cmiddle class economics\u201d five times.

Middle-class economics works.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt every moment of economic change throughout our history, this country has taken bold action to adapt to new circumstances, and to make sure everyone gets a fair shot,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe set up worker protections, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to protect ourselves from the harshest adversity. We gave our citizens schools and colleges, infrastructure and the Internet \u2013 tools they needed to go as far as their effort will take them.\u201d\n\nUnder Obama\u2019s plan, capital gains tax rates would increase to 28 percent from 23.8 percent. The rate was already increased once under Obama, as it was at 15 percent when he came into office. President Bill Clinton signed a capital gains tax cut in in 1997. It would also expand to tax estates for capital gainses on securities when inherited. Among the tax credits would be a $500 annual tax credit for households with two income earners. His plan would also expand the child tax credit to $3,000 per year.\n\nThough few expect the president\u2019s budget proposal to pass, he referred to it as \u201cpractical, not partisan.\u201d\n\nIn his first State of the Union address to a House and Senate both controlled by Republicans, he issued a sweeping warning.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t put the security of families at risk by taking away their health insurance, or unraveling the new rules on Wall Street, or refighting past battles on immigration when we\u2019ve got a system to fix,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd if a bill comes to my desk that tries to do any of these things, it will earn my veto.\u201d\n\nObama went on to talk about restoring trust between police and minorities after the controversial police altercations in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City that ended in the deaths of unarmed black men.\n\n\u201cWe may have different takes on the events of Ferguson and New York. But surely we can understand a father who fears his son can\u2019t walk home without being harassed,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSurely we can understand the wife who won\u2019t rest until the police officer she married walks through the front door at the end of his shift. Surely we can agree it\u2019s a good thing that for the first time in 40 years, the crime rate and the incarceration rate have come down together, and use that as a starting point for Democrats and Republicans, community leaders and law enforcement, to reform America\u2019s criminal justice system so that it protects and serves us all.\u201d\n\nObama has established task forces to look into community policing and into the use of military equipment by local police departments.\n\nObama said the United State has engaged in a \u201csmarter kind of American leadership\u201d regarding foreign policy with diplomacy and coalition-building. This, he said, is leading to progress in battling the Islamic State militant group.\n\n\u201cIn Iraq and Syria, American leadership \u2013 including our military power \u2013 is stopping ISIL\u2019s advance,\u201d Obama said. \u201cInstead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group. We\u2019re also supporting a moderate opposition in Syria that can help us in this effort\u201d\n\nThe president again did not specify \u201cradical Islam,\u201d but he said the United States is \u201cassisting people everywhere who stand up to the bankrupt ideology of violent extremism.\u201d\n\nHe did reference Islam in talking about American value, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s why we continue to reject offensive stereotypes of Muslims \u2013 the vast majority of whom share our commitment to peace. That\u2019s why we defend free speech.\u201d At that, Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) held up a pencil to represent solidarity with the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo, which was targeted in a terror assault in response to cartoons it has published of the Prophet Muhammad.\n\nWell after talking about terrorism, the president said that \u201cno challenge \u2013 no challenge \u2013 poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.\u201d\n\nWhile most initiatives received applause along party lines, some Democrats sat out cheering when Obama said, \u201cI\u2019m asking both parties to give me trade promotion authority to protect American workers, with strong new trade deals from Asia to Europe that aren\u2019t just free, but fair.\u201d\n\nIn calling for cybersecurity measures, Obama also made a veiled reference to North Korea, which the United States has accused of perpetrating the Sony hack last year.\n\n\u201cNo foreign nation, no hacker, should be able to shut down our networks, steal our trade secrets, or invade the privacy of American families, especially our kids,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe are making sure our government integrates intelligence to combat cyber threats, just as we have done to combat terrorism.\u201d\n\nLast week, a group claiming sympathy to the Islamic State hacked the social media accounts of U.S. Central Command. Obama urged Congress \u201cto finally pass the legislation we need to better meet the evolving threat of cyberattacks, combat identity theft and protect our children\u2019s information.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t act, we\u2019ll leave our nation and our economy vulnerable. If we do, we can continue to protect the technologies that have unleashed untold opportunities for people around the globe,\u201d Obama said.\n\nObama called for Congress to pass America\u2019s College Promise, which would provide two free years of community college for students that maintain a 2.5 grade point average. The administration estimates it would cost $60 billion.\n\n\u201cI am sending this Congress a bold new plan to lower the cost of community college \u2013 to zero,\u201d Obama said. \u201cForty percent of our college students choose community college. Some are young and starting out. Some are older and looking for a better job. Some are veterans and single parents trying to transition back into the job market. Whoever you are, this plan is your chance to graduate ready for the new economy, without a load of debt.\u201d\n\nObama again called for Congress to raise the minimum wage, a central point of last year\u2019s address. This year, he seemed to taunt GOP lawmakers to raise the wage.\n\n\u201cTo everyone in this Congress who still refuses to raise the minimum wage, I say this: If you truly believe you could work full-time and support a family on less than $15,000 a year, go try it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf not, vote to give millions of the hardest-working people in America a raise.\u201d\n\nAfter the Obama administration was plagued by a Department of Veterans Affairs waiting list scandal, the president talked agains about how the administrations is improving veterans\u2019 access to health care, job training and other benefits.\n\n\u201cAlready, we\u2019ve made strides towards ensuring that every veteran has access to the highest quality care,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re slashing the backlog that had too many veterans waiting years to get the benefits they need, and we\u2019re making it easier for vets to translate their training and experience into civilian jobs.\u201d", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:17:12.314+0000", "event": "articles"}

But in 2009, the Obama administration spent almost $2 billion to help a corporation do exactly that.\n\n\u201cThe company is still using all the services and all the benefits of effectively being a U.S. corporation; they just decided that they\u2019d go through this paper exercise,\u201d Obama said during a press conference. \u201cI think it\u2019s something that would really bother the average American, the idea that somebody renounces their citizenship but continues to entirely benefit from operating in the United States of America just to avoid paying a whole bunch of taxes.\u201d\n\nA \u201cwhole bunch\u201d could be an accurate characterization, as the United States has the highest corporate tax rate in the developed world, prompting corporate inversion, a practice of a U.S. company with a foreign subsidiary becoming a foreign company with a U.S. subsidiary to get a more favorable tax climate.\n\nIt was among the reasons that Delphi Automotive, an auto parts manufacturer, switched from being an American company to being a British company \u2013 with the help of $1.7 billion from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2009, Bloomberg News reported. Thus, the federal government essentially subsidized a move that would mean less revenue.\n\nRevenue has been Obama\u2019s chief reason for reform.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s not fair, it\u2019s not right,\u201d Obama said during the Wednesday press conference, speaking broadly on the issue. \u201cThe lost revenue to Treasury means it\u2019s got to be made up somewhere, and that typically is going to be a bunch of hardworking Americans who either pay through higher taxes themselves or through reduced services.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s why he said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is looking into potential executive actions if Congress doesn\u2019t pass a reform.\n\n\u201cWhat we are doing is examining: Are there elements to how existing statutes are interpreted by rule or by regulation or tradition or practice that can at least discourage some of the folks who may be trying to take advantage of this loophole?\u201d Obama said.\n\nThe Delphi inversion assistances was part of the larger auto bailout, and one means of the government helping to boost General Motors, the chief customer for Delphi. Delphi still paid taxes in the U.S., but their tax bill was reduced by as much as $110 million per year, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nAt 39.1 percent, the United States has the highest tax rate on business of any other developed country in the world, according to Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative group.\n\nThe United Kingdom \u2013 where Delphi incorporated \u2013 has a corporate tax rate of 21 percent, according to Bloomberg.\n\nEach of America\u2019s other major trading partners \u2013 Canada, Mexico, Japan, Germany, and France \u2013 have lower corporate tax rates than the United States, averaging about 25 percent, according to ATR.\n\nAfter getting back on its feet with the government\u2019s help, Delphi\u2019s shares have more than tripled since going public in 2011, Bloomberg reported. So, in June, the Internal Revenue Service told the company that the 2009 switch from Michigan to England should be disregarded and that it\u2019s time to pay U.S. taxes again. Delphi responded it its securities filing that it will \u201cvigorously contest\u201d the IRS demand.\n\nThough Obama and other Democrats frequently talk about \u201ceconomic patriotism\u201d as a reason for companies to pay U.S. corporate taxes, the administration has awarded more than $1 billion in government contracts each year to companies that incorporate overseas, Bloomberg reported.\n\nDemocrats on the House Ways and Means Committee contend that not taking action will mean nearly $20 billion is lost in revenue over a decade.\n\n\u2013\n\nFollow Fred Lucas (@FredVLucas3) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:17:15.007+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1435, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "LAREDO, Texas (TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 Ever sure of himself, Donald Trump paid a visit to the Mexico border Thursday and predicted Hispanics would love him \u2013 \u201cthey already do\u201d \u2013 because as president he\u2019d grab jobs back from overseas and give more opportunity to those who live in the U.S. legally.\n\nWhen asked about his relationship with Hispanics, Trump replied defiantly, \u201cI think I\u2019ll win the Hispanic vote.\u201d Still, he didn\u2019t shy away from discussing the issue of illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s great danger with the illegals,\u201d the Republican presidential contender told a group confrontational reporters, while still claiming he has a \u201cgreat relationship\u201d with Hispanics. Some Latino leaders have come at him with blistering criticism for his painting Mexican immigrants as criminals.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take jobs back from China, I\u2019ll take jobs back from Japan,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe Hispanics are going to get those jobs, and they\u2019re going to love Trump.\u201d\n\nThe in-and-out border visit came as Trump continued to dominate attention in the GOP presidential race, to the growing exasperation of his rivals. Campaigning in Gorham, New Hampshire, Jeb Bush offered a distinctly different message in the immigration debate \u2013 and spoke partly in Spanish.\n\n\u201cA Republican will never be elected president of the United States again unless we campaign like this,\u201d Bush said, gesturing with open arms.\n\n\u201cUnless we campaign openly \u2013 where we campaign in every nook and cranny of this country, where we go campaign in the Latino communities, fast-growing communities all across this country that will make a difference in who the next president is going to be.\u201d\n\nTrump, a businessman and reality TV host, set up a dramatic scene in advance of his own campaign trip, saying he was putting himself in \u201cgreat danger\u201d by coming to the border area across from the volatile Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo. But, he said, \u201cI have to do it. I have to do it.\u201d\n\nAs he spoke to reporters with his back to the out-of-sight Rio Grande, a huge stream of transport trucks inched peacefully from the Mexican side onto the World Trade Bridge and into Texas at a bustling commercial hub routinely visited by officials. Trump traveled in a massive police-escorted motorcade on roads closed for his entourage.\n\nWatch video from the press conference below:\n\nA local border patrol union pulled out of events involving him. Patrol agents had planned to accompany Trump to the border and hold a meeting with him but canceled after consultations with their national union, the National Border Patrol Council, said Hector Garza, president of Local 2455.\n\nTrump stepped off his plane in Laredo and said the union members backed out because they were \u201cpetrified and they\u2019re afraid of saying what\u2019s happening\u201d at the border. Dozens of people were on hand, a mix of protesters and supporters.\n\nSome chanted \u201cfuera,\u201d telling him to get out; a supporter waved a sign, \u201cno era insulto,\u201d meaning his remarks about immigrants that touched off a feud with Republican rivals were not an insult.\n\nHis visit drew strong reaction from some residents of Laredo, which has an overwhelmingly Hispanic population.\n\nPedro Omar Castillo, 72, suggested that Trump needs the growing Hispanic vote to be successful in 2016. \u201cBut he\u2019s not going to get it because of his words,\u201d Castillo said in Spanish as he walked through a downtown park. \u201cHe is a racist.\u201d\n\nBut Karina Villalba, 26, waited for Trump at the airport and held a sign saying \u201cI heard your speech & I am NOT offended.\u201d\n\nA Hispanic oil-field worker, she said she appreciates Trump\u2019s in-your-face tone. \u201cSometimes honesty hurts,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump roiled the presidential race weeks ago when he branded Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, sparking a feud with his GOP rivals that intensified after his dismissive comments about Arizona Sen. John McCain\u2019s military service in the Vietnam War.\n\nFrom party heavyweights like former Bush to relative newcomers to the national scene like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Trump\u2019s rivals face his tactics of calling out his critics by name, vilifying the GOP establishment and injecting inflammatory rhetoric into the immigration debate.\n\nIn Washington on Wednesday, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry denounced Trump\u2019s campaign as a \u201ccancer on conservatism\u201d and a \u201cbarking carnival act\u201d in a speech that defined \u201cTrumpism\u201d as \u201ca toxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense that will lead the Republican Party to perdition if pursued.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the insults flying between Trump and his rivals have been caustic. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday, \u201cThe only way we\u2019re going to be able to lose the election is continue to say things like Donald Trump is saying.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s sort of a political car wreck where people slow down and watch,\u201d Graham told MSNBC.\n\n\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Calvin Woodward and Alicia A.

{"entityId": 1445, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "Just days before an election that will likely see Democratic losses in the House and Senate, some Democrats are already trying to blame that result on Republican attempts to restrict blacks from voting.\n\nIt\u2019s an argument that many Democrats are likely to stoke over the next two years as they try to restrict states from imposing voter ID laws, and as they make the case for electing a Democratic president in 2016.\n\nEarlier this month, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Marcia Fudge (D-Ohio) helped set up the argument by saying Democrats can\u2019t win unless blacks turn out to vote.\n\n\u201cAnybody who looks at the data realized that if the black vote, and the brown vote, doesn\u2019t turn out, we can\u2019t win,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just that simple.\u201d\n\nAs more polls have predicted GOP gains in the House and Senate, Democrats have increasingly blamed voter ID laws in states with Republican governors as the reason why Democrats don\u2019t have a shot at picking up seats. Democrats have argued for months that voter ID laws keep minorities from voting.\n\nRep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), a former chair of the CBC, wrote this week that while the U.S. has made progress trying to end racial inequities, voter ID laws are a remaining barrier to that goal that must be removed.\n\n\u201c[R]acial discrimination is far from over, especially in voting rights,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe have seen this discrimination in voter ID laws, limited early voting, and biased attempts at redistricting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe only way to end these discriminatory laws and practices is to vote on November 4th for candidates that support restoring and protecting the voting rights of all Americans,\u201d she said.\n\nLee and other Democrats have blamed a 2013 Supreme Court decision for allowing voter ID laws to remain in place. In June 2013, the court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act that sets out the criteria for deciding which state and local government need to have their voting rules approved by the federal government.\n\nThose rules were designed to monitor states and counties, mostly in the South, that had a history of discriminating against blacks at the polls. But the Supreme Court said those guidelines are outdated, and don\u2019t reflect the changes and improvements seen in many of these Southern states.\n\nThat ruling essentially nullified language in the law allowing for federal oversight of local election rules, a provision that cannot take effect again until Congress agrees on a new set of rules. A bipartisan bill has already been introduced to create these new guidelines, but Lee accused Republicans this week of stalling the bill to keep minorities from voting.\n\n\u201cSadly, the House Republican leadership refuses to hold a hearing or vote on the bill, despite broad bipartisan and public support,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe can pass this bill but there are those in positions of leadership, that are afraid of minority, young, and older voters.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want to turn back the clock to the days of poll taxes and Jim Crow,\u201d she added. \u201cAs a community and nation, we have come too far to allow the clock to be turned back.\u201d\n\nRepublicans have defended voter ID laws as a way to ensure only U.S. citizens vote, and have said they are not trying to limit the participation of any legal voters. Still, GOP gains in the House and Senate are likely to be seen by Democrats as proof that Republicans worked successfully to keep minorities away from the polls this year.\n\nSome Democrats already appear to have drawn that conclusion. In the wake of a Supreme Court decision allowing Texas to keep its voter ID law in place for the midterm election, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said studies show that law will keep 600,000 otherwise eligible people from voting.\n\n\u201cThe Republican Party has decided that rather than meet the needs of the emerging voting block, they\u2019re going to try and disenfranchise them,\u201d she said, according to KCBS in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cIt is so sad to see the party of Lincoln has taken this approach,\u201d Boxer said on MSNBC. \u201cThey can\u2019t win on the issues so they\u2019re trying to stop people from getting to the polls.\u201d\n\nBoxer also said she would introduce legislation forcing any state with a voter ID law to ensure that people have easy access to free government IDs.

{"entityId": 1447, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are effectively stuck with one another in an icy relationship that has defined most of the last six years of U.S.-Israel relations.\n\n\u201cWe can expect a long, hard and difficult 21 months ahead,\u201d said Sarah Stern, president of the Endowment for Middle East Truth, a pro-Israel think tank in Washington. \u201cIt was very obvious the president did not want the prime minister to be victorious in the election. I think President Obama was very angry when he looked at the polls and very, very frustrated.\u201d\n\nIt took the Obama administration until mid-afternoon Wednesday to speak publicly about Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party emerging victorious against the Zionist Union, a liberal merger between the Israeli Labor and Hatnuah parties.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would call Netanayhu \u201cin the coming days.\u201d Earnest told reporters in two previous Israeli elections, Obama did not phone Netanyahu until he was directed by the Israeli president to form a government. Netanyahu is still forming a coalition government. But Earnest pointed out Secretary of State John Kerry called to congratulate Netanyahu Wednesday.\n\nAsked whether the call could be characterized as \u201cwarm and lengthy\u201d State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said, \u201cIt was a brief phone call.\u201d\n\n\u201cSecretary Kerry called the prime minister this morning to congratulate him. Given there is an ongoing government formation process they did not discuss substantive issues,\u201d Psaki said. Pressed on details, she said, \u201cI\u2019m not going to characterize the tone of the call. I wasn\u2019t on the call.\u201d\n\nThough the White House said repeatedly said that Obama was neutral in the Tuesday election, the two leaders have been at odds over various issues including U.S.-led nuclear negotiations with Iran and Israel\u2019s Jerusalem settlements. Most recently, Obama did not meet with Netanyahu when he was in Washington earlier this month to address Congress, citing the close proximity to the election.\n\nStern also worried that Obama\u2019s frustration could lead the administration to be less supportive of Israel at the United Nations, where Israel is frequently fending off hostile resolutions.\n\n\u201cThe administration seems to have an agenda and it is not an agenda that is well disposed to the continuing survival of the Jewish state,\u201d Stern told TheBlaze, referring to the Iran deal and the U.N. \u201cI worry we\u2019ll see Israel isolated.\u201d\n\nWith Netanyahu\u2019s election victory, there is no pathway to make U.S.-Israel relations any easier to manage, said Samuel Stanton, acting chairman of the political science department at Grove City College in Pennsylvania.\n\n\u201cNetanyahu has stated in the last 36 hours his unwillingness to see a Palestinian state exist. The existence of a Palestinian state is an end goal of the Obama administration in the region as this administration still seeks to fulfill the promises of the failed Oslo Accords,\u201d Stanton said.\n\nObama is seeking to bridge the divide between the U.S. and Muslim world, and that effort \u201cbegins and ends with how Muslims perceive of U.S. relations with Israel in regard to the question of a Palestinian state,\u201d Stanton said.\n\nAlthough not a U.S. election, the result can be viewed as a defeat for Obama, said Gary Rose, chairman of the political science department at Sacred Heart University in Connecticut.\n\n\u201cBoth the prime minister of Israel and the Republicans can point to the results, even though close, as indicating that President Obama by negotiating a deal with Iran is not working in Israel\u2019s best interest or the interest of the U. S.,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWorking with the Obama administration will of course continue but the distrust is likely deeper and the relationship even more strained than before. This was a good day for Netanyahu and the GOP in Congress and a very bad day for President Obama.\u201d\n\nStill, much could depend on Netanyahu\u2019s governing coalition in the Knesset, University of Iowa political science professor Tim Hagle said.\n\n\u201cIt certainly won\u2019t be the first time two world leaders who didn\u2019t have a good personal relationship still had to find a way to work together,\u201d Hagle said. \u201cOne additional factor will be how hard it will be for Netanyahu to form a ruling coalition? Early reports suggest it won\u2019t be all that difficult, but to the extent Netanyahu is limited by local political factors it gives Obama a bit more of an edge in terms of working with him.\u201d\n\nStill, there is a major gap in trust, particularly on Iran, Hagle said.\n\n\u201cAs much as Obama has said the U.S. cannot let Iran obtain nuclear weapons, Netanyahu might very well wonder whether this is another \u2018red line.\u2019 In other words, what will the U.S. do to prevent it?\u201d Hagle said. \u201cPerhaps more important, should Israel decide to take action on its own to degrade Iran\u2019s nuclear capabilities will the U.S. step in to prevent it?\u201d\n\nWith the eletion over, another U.S. controversy could continue.\n\nThe Senate is reportedly prepared to probe whether the Obama administration used federal dollars to try to help Herzog defeat Netanyahu. This reportedly came through the State Department funding the nonprofit OneVoice Movement, which has an Israeli subsidiary, Victory 15, that sought to oust the prime minister and was advised by an ex-Obama campaign adviser.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest rejected the notion Tuesday that the administration would be involved.\n\n\u201cThe administration, since earlier this year, has gone to great lengths to demonstrate our commitment to not interfering in the Israeli elections and the truth is that is a stance that has garnered some criticism,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThis post was updated to include reaction from the Obama administration.", "score": 3, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:18:30.304+0000", "event": "articles"}

(TheBlaze/AP) \u2014 In a rare move for him, President Barack Obama paused in the middle of his Martha\u2019s Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night.\n\nObama met with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers in regard to the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\nThe White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He\u2019s received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. The White House had also already announced Obama\u2019s plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests.\n\nPart of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises.\n\nYet those crises turned the first week of Obama\u2019s vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements regarding Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas.\n\nObama is scheduled to return to Martha\u2019s Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend.\n\nEven though work has occupied much of Obama\u2019s first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island.\n\nHe hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. They left for Washington late Sunday night.\n\nObama\u2019s vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan\u2019s wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\nThat get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama\u2019s vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama\u2019s foreign policy.\n\nClinton later promised she and Obama would \u201chug it out\u201d when they saw each other at Jordan\u2019s party. No reporters were allowed in, so it\u2019s not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:18:32.081+0000", "event": "articles"}

{"entityId": 1459, "entityType": "political", "properties": {"text": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 A White House lunch aiming for cooperation boiled into a fresh dispute with newly empowered Republicans over immigration reform Friday, with GOP leaders warning President Barack Obama to his face not to take unilateral action. The president stood unflinchingly by his plan to act.\n\nRepublicans attending the postelection lunch at Obama\u2019s invitation said they asked him for more time to work on legislation, but the president said his patience was running out. He underscored his intent to act on his own by the end of the year if they don\u2019t approve legislation to ease deportations before then and send it to him to sign.\n\nThe Republicans\u2019 approach, three days after they resoundingly won control of the Senate in midterm elections, \u201cseemed to fall on deaf ears,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said in a telephone interview. \u201cThe president instead of being contrite or saying in effect to America, \u2018I hear you,\u2019 as a result of the referendum on his policies that drove this last election, he seems unmoved and even defiant.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he would want to sabotage his last two years as president by doing something this provocative,\u201d said Cornyn. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell earlier this week said the president\u2019s stance was \u201clike waving a red flag in front of a bull.\u201d\n\nObama press secretary Josh Earnest said there was no reason that executive action on immigration should kill opportunities for the president and Republicans to find common ground.\n\n\u201cI could stand up here and say Republicans to vote once again for the 50th time to repeal the Affordable Care Act, that that\u2019s playing with fire or waving a red flag in front of a bull. I\u2019m not really sure what that means,\u201d Earnest said.\n\nThe White House said lawmakers went home from the meeting with a parting gift \u2014 a six-pack of beer brewed at the White House. The White House also said Obama laid out three areas where he and Congress could work together before the end of the year \u2014 emergency funding to combat the Ebola outbreak, approval of a federal budget and quick action on spending to fight the Islamic State militant group.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner\u2019s office said he told Obama he was ready to work with the president on a new authorization for military force against the IS group if the president worked to build bipartisan support. The White House announced soon after lunch ended that the U.S. was sending as many as 1,500 more troops to Iraq to serve as advisers, trainers and security personnel as part of the mission. Obama is also asking Congress for more than $5 billion to help fund the fight.\n\nFriday\u2019s two-hour meeting was tense at times, according to a senior House Republican aide. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, about to lose his grip on the upper chamber, barely said a word, the aide said. The aide said at one point as House Speaker John Boehner was making an argument on immigration, Obama responded that his patience was running out and Vice President Joe Biden interrupted to ask how long Republicans needed. Obama angrily cut Biden off, the aide said.\n\nThe aide was not authorized to describe the back-and-forth publicly by name and spoke only on condition of anonymity.\n\nPublicly Obama\u2019s tone was more upbeat as he opened the gathering. He pledged to work on ending long-running partisan gridlock and to be open to Republican ideas. The president said the lunch was a chance to \u201cexplore where we can make progress\u201d after Americans showed in the midterm elections that they wanted to see more accomplished in Washington.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d like to see more cooperation,\u201d Obama said, sitting at the middle of 13 lawmakers in the Old Family Dining Room set with the Truman china. \u201cAnd I think all of us have the responsibility, me in particular, to try to make that happen.\u201d\n\nReporters were ushered out before any lawmaker spoke or the lunch of sea bass was served. Republican descriptions of the meeting were provided after they returned to Capitol Hill.\n\nFor the record, Boehner\u2019s office said he suggested that the president should back a Republican jobs bill as a starting place for bipartisan action.\n\nObama said at the start he was interested in \u201chearing and sharing ideas\u201d for compromise on measures to boost the economy, then mentioned his personal priorities of college affordability and investment in road and building projects. He also touted improved monthly job growth numbers out Friday as evidence his economic policies are working, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re doing something right here.\u201d\n\nBriefings on Ebola and the Islamic State from Pentagon officials dominated much of the meeting, and the immigration debate was said to have lasted about half an hour. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said Republicans told Obama that any executive order, particularly on immigration but any issue, would be a \u201ctoxic decision.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe still hasn\u2019t come to grips with the reality of the election and the consequences of the election,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cHis tone and tenor didn\u2019t seem to reflect that of somebody whose policies were just significantly rejected all across the country just three days ago.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Donna Cassata and Andrew Taylor contributed to this report.", "score": 2, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:18:44.444+0000", "event": "articles"}

Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, responding to a question about why celebrity businessman Donald Trump is surging in GOP presidential polls, echoed Koch\u2019s sentiments that the country is at a crossroads.\n\n\u201cAmericans instinctively understand that we have reached another one of those pivotal moments in our history where what\u2019s at stake is not what party is in charge but our identity as a nation and as a people,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cAnd they want to see candidates that are passionate about that and will do something about it.\u201d\n\nTrump wasn\u2019t as generous in his assessment of Rubio and the others who came to the Koch retreat, writing on Twitter: \u201cI wish good luck to all of the Republican candidates that traveled to California to beg for money etc. from the Koch Brothers.

Yet even those deep-pocketed donors must check their mobile phones at the doors of some strategy sessions.\n\nFor the first time, a small number of reporters were invited to hear the 2016 candidates and attend some other forums. As a condition of attending, reporters were not permitted to identify any of the donors in attendance.\n\nMost of the Koch-backed entities are nonprofits that do not have to disclose their donors. The two most politically active groups are American for Prosperity, which deploys activists to knock on doors and discuss issues important to the Kochs, and Freedom Partners, which has a super PAC that can spend directly on elections.\n\nAlthough leaders for those two groups say they aren\u2019t endorsing anyone in the GOP primary, donors at the retreat have the ability to write million-dollar checks to boost a candidate\u2019s chances.\n\n\u2014\n\nFollow Dave Urbanski (@DaveVUrbanski) on Twitter", "score": 1, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:18:45.286+0000", "event": "articles"}

Chuck Schumer, the No. 3 Senate Democrat and next-in-line party leader, said late Thursday that he is breaking with President Barack Obama and will oppose the Iran nuclear deal.\n\n\u201cAfter deep study, careful thought and considerable soul-searching, I have decided I must oppose the agreement and will vote yes on a motion of disapproval,\u201d Schumer said in a statement weeks before he will cast a vote.\n\n\u201cI have decided I must oppose the agreement and will vote yes on a motion of disapproval.\u201d Share:\n\nSchumer, a leading Jewish Democrat, is the first senator of Obama\u2019s party to step forward to oppose the deal. His announcement came just hours after two other Senate Democrats \u2014 New York\u2019s Kirsten Gillibrand and New Hampshire\u2019s Jeanne Shaheen \u2014 announced their support for the international accord.\n\nThe deal, struck last month with Tehran and Western powers, would curb Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for billions of dollars in relief from crippling sanctions.\n\nSchumer\u2019s decision is a blow to the administration, though it remains to be seen how many other Democratic lawmakers follow the New York senator. Schumer informed the White House of his decision Thursday afternoon. New York Rep. Eliot Engel, who is Jewish and the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement that he too would oppose the deal.\n\nSchumer\u2019s split with Obama is remarkable for a senior leader in line to replace Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., after he retires at the end of next year.\n\nSchumer\u2019s decision also puts him at odds with the Democrats\u2019 likely presidential nominee, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has cautiously embraced the deal. The Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, Dick Durbin of Illinois, supports the accord and has been working hard to persuade lawmakers to do the same.\n\nThe administration, which has lobbied intensely for the pact, had secured the backing of more than a dozen Senate Democrats and more than two dozen House Democrats, including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Republicans, who control the House and Senate, are uniformly opposed to the deal.\n\nSchumer signaled that he wouldn\u2019t lobby hard against the accord. The House and Senate will begin debate on a resolution of disapproval when lawmakers return to Washington on Sept. 8 after their August recess. The administration needs Democratic support to sustain a widely expected veto by Obama of any resolution of disapproval.\n\n\u201cThere are some who believe that I can force my colleagues to vote my way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhile I will certainly share my view and try to persuade them that the vote to disapprove is the right one, in my experience with matters of conscience and great consequence like this, each member ultimately comes to their own conclusion.\u201d\n\nSchumer has been under pressure as a congressional ally of Israel, leading fundraiser and strategist for his party, and lawmaker from a state that is home to more than a million-and-a-half Jews.\n\n\u201cThe very real risk that Iran will not moderate and will, instead, use the agreement to pursue its nefarious goals is too great,\u201d he said in opposing the pact.\n\nSchumer said he based his decision on the nuclear and non-nuclear elements of the accord and on the question of \u201cAre we better off with the agreement or without it?\u201d\n\nHe complained that the pact does not allow inspections \u201canywhere, anytime\u201d and that the United States cannot demand inspections unilaterally.\n\nSchumer joins a handful of Jewish Democrats who have announced their opposition \u2014 Reps. Steve Israel and Nita Lowey of New York and Ted Deutch of Florida. Michigan Rep. Sander Levin, however, has endorsed the deal.\n\nThe powerful pro-Israel lobby American Israel Public Affairs Committee is vehemently opposed to the deal, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has denounced as undermining the security of Israel and the region. Opponents of the pact have targeted Schumer in campaign-style ads.\n\nThe media-friendly Schumer made the announcement through the blog Medium, not in a high-profile speech on the Senate floor like several of his colleagues. His statement was posted as much of the political world was focused on the first Republican presidential candidate debate.\n\n\u2014", "score": 3, "label": "Republican"}, "eventTime": "2015-09-12T04:18:52.478+0000", "event": "articles"}
